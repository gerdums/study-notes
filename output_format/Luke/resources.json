    "content": "The Gospel According to Luke Title As with the other 3 Gospels, the title is derived from the author’s name. According to tradition, Luke was a Gentile. The apostle Paul seems to confirm this, distinguishing Luke from those who were “from the circumcision” ( <a ref='Colossians 4:11'>Col 4:11</a> , <a ref='Colossians 4:14'>14</a> ). That would make Luke the only Gentile to pen any books of Scripture. He is responsible for a significant portion of the NT, having written both this Gospel and the book of Acts (see Author and Date). Very little is known about Luke. He almost never included personal details about himself, and nothing definite is known about his background or his conversion. Both Eusebius and Jerome identified him as a native of Antioch (which may explain why so much of the book of Acts centers on Antioch—cf. <a ref='Acts 11:19–27'>Ac 11:19–27</a> ; <a ref='Acts 13:1–3'>13:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Acts 14:26'>14:26</a> ; <a ref='Acts 15:22–23'>15:22–23</a> , <a ref='Acts 15:30–35'>30–35</a> ; <a ref='Acts 18:22–23'>18:22–23</a> ). Luke was a frequent companion of the apostle Paul, at least from the time of Paul’s Macedonian vision ( <a ref='Acts 16:9–10'>Ac 16:9–10</a> ) right up to the time of Paul’s martyrdom ( <a ref='2 Timothy 4:11'>2Ti 4:11</a> ). The apostle Paul referred to Luke as a physician ( <a ref='Colossians 4:14'>Col 4:14</a> ). Luke’s interest in medical phenomena is evident in the high profile he gave to Jesus’ healing ministry (e.g., <a ref='Luke 4:38–40'>4:38–40</a> ; <a ref='Luke 5:15–25'>5:15–25</a> ; <a ref='Luke 6:17–19'>6:17–19</a> ; <a ref='Luke 7:11–15'>7:11–15</a> ; <a ref='Luke 8:43–47'>8:43–47</a> , <a ref='Luke 8:49–56'>49–56</a> ; <a ref='Luke 9:2'>9:2</a> , <a ref='Luke 9:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Luke 9:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='Luke 13:11–13'>13:11–13</a> ; <a ref='Luke 14:2–4'>14:2–4</a> ; <a ref='Luke 17:12–14'>17:12–14</a> ; <a ref='Luke 22:50–51'>22:50–51</a> ). In Luke’s day, physicians did not have a unique vocabulary of technical terminology; so when Luke discusses healings and other medical issues, his language is not markedly different from that of the other Gospel writers. Author and Date The Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts clearly were written by the same individual (cf. <a ref='Luke 1:1–4'>1:1–4</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:1'>Ac 1:1</a> ). Although he never identified himself by name, it is clear from his use of “we” in many sections of Acts that he was a close companion of the apostle Paul ( <a ref='Acts 16:10–17'>Ac 16:10–17</a> ; <a ref='Acts 20:5–15'>20:5–15</a> ; <a ref='Acts 21:1–18'>21:1–18</a> ; <a ref='Acts 27:1–28:16'>27:1—28:16</a> ). Luke is the only person, among the colleagues Paul mentions in his own epistles ( <a ref='Colossians 4:14'>Col 4:14</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 4:11'>2Ti 4:11</a> ; <a ref='Philemon 1:24'>Phm 24</a> ), who fits the profile of the author of these books. That accords perfectly with the earliest tradition of the church which unanimously attributed this Gospel to Luke. Luke and Acts appear to have been written at about the same time—Luke first, then Acts. Combined, they make a 2-volume work addressed to “Theophilus” ( <a ref='Luke 1:3'>1:3</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:1'>Ac 1:1</a> ; see Background and Setting) giving a sweeping history of the founding of Christianity, from the birth of Christ to Paul’s imprisonment under house arrest in Rome ( <a ref='Acts 28:30–31'>Ac 28:30–31</a> ). The book of Acts ends with Paul still in Rome, which leads to the conclusion that Luke wrote these books from Rome during Paul’s imprisonment there (ca. AD 60–62). Luke records Jesus’ prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 ( <a ref='Luke 19:42–44'>19:42–44</a> ; <a ref='Luke 21:20–24'>21:20–24</a> ) but makes no mention of the fulfillment of that prophecy, either here or in Acts. Luke made it a point to record such prophetic fulfillments (cf. <a ref='Acts 11:28'>Ac 11:28</a> ), so it is extremely unlikely he wrote these books after the Roman invasion of Jerusalem. Acts also includes no mention of the great persecution that began under Nero in AD 64. In addition, many scholars set the date of James’ martyrdom at AD 62, and if that was before Luke completed his history, he certainly would have mentioned it. So, the most likely date for this Gospel is AD 60 or 61. Background and Setting Luke dedicated his works to “most excellent Theophilus” (lit. “lover of God”— <a ref='Luke 1:3'>1:3</a> ; cf. <a ref='Acts 1:1'>Ac 1:1</a> ). This designation, which may be a nickname or a pseudonym, is accompanied by a formal address (“most excellent”)—possibly signifying that “Theophilus” was a well-known Roman dignitary, perhaps one of those who had turned to Christ in “Caesar’s household” ( <a ref='Philippians 4:22'>Php 4:22</a> ). It is almost certain, however, that Luke envisioned a much broader audience for his work than this one man. The dedications at the outset of Luke and Acts are like the formal dedication in a modern book. They are not like the address of an epistle. Luke expressly stated that his knowledge of the events recorded in his Gospel came from the reports of those who were eyewitnesses ( <a ref='Luke 1:1–2'>1:1–2</a> )—strongly implying that he himself was not an eyewitness. It is clear from his prologue that his aim was to give an ordered account of the events of Jesus’ life, but this does not mean he always followed a strict chronological order in all instances (e.g., <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 3:20'>3:20</a></i> ). By acknowledging that he had compiled his account from various extant sources ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 1:1'>1:1</a></i> ), Luke was not disclaiming divine inspiration for his work. The process of inspiration never bypasses or overrides the personalities, vocabularies, and styles of the human authors of Scripture. The unique traits of the human authors are always indelibly stamped on all the books of Scripture. Luke’s research is no exception to this rule. The research itself was orchestrated by divine Providence. And in his writing, Luke was moved by the Spirit of God ( <a ref='2 Peter 1:21'>2Pe 1:21</a> ). Therefore, his account is infallibly true ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 1:3'>1:3</a></i> ). Historical and Theological Themes Luke’s style is that of a scholarly, well-read author ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 1:1–4'>1:1–4</a></i> ). He wrote as a meticulous historian, often giving details that helped identify the historical context of the events he described ( <a ref='Luke 1:5'>1:5</a> ; <a ref='Luke 2:1–2'>2:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Luke 3:1–2'>3:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Luke 13:1–4'>13:1–4</a> ). His account of the nativity is the fullest in all the Gospel records—and (like the rest of Luke’s work) more polished in its literary style. He included in the birth narrative a series of praise psalms ( <a ref='Luke 1:46–55'>1:46–55</a> ; <a ref='Luke 1:68–79'>1:68–79</a> ; <a ref='Luke 2:14'>2:14</a> ; <a ref='Luke 2:29–32'>2:29–32</a> , <a ref='Luke 2:34–35'>34–35</a> ). He alone reported the unusual circumstances surrounding the birth of John the Baptist, the annunciation to Mary, the manger, the shepherds, and Simeon and Anna ( <a ref='Luke 2:25–38'>2:25–38</a> ). A running theme in Luke’s Gospel is Jesus’ compassion for Gentiles, Samaritans, women, children, tax collectors, sinners, and others often regarded as outcasts in Israel. Every time he mentions a tax collector ( <a ref='Luke 3:12'>3:12</a> ; <a ref='Luke 5:27'>5:27</a> ; <a ref='Luke 7:29'>7:29</a> ; <a ref='Luke 15:1'>15:1</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:10–13'>18:10–13</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:2'>19:2</a> ), it is in a positive sense. Yet, Luke did not ignore the salvation of those who were rich and respectable—e.g., <a ref='Luke 23:50–53'>23:50–53</a> . From the outset of Jesus’ public ministry ( <a ref='Luke 4:18'>4:18</a> ) to the Lord’s final words on the cross ( <a ref='Luke 23:40–43'>23:40–43</a> ), Luke underscored this theme of Christ’s ministry to the pariahs of society. Again and again he showed how the Great Physician ministered to those most aware of their need (cf. <a ref='Luke 5:31–32'>5:31–32</a> ; <a ref='Luke 15:4–7'>15:4–7</a> , <a ref='Luke 15:31–32'>31–32</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:10'>19:10</a> ). The high profile Luke accords to women is particularly significant. From the nativity account, where Mary, Elizabeth, and Anna are given prominence (chaps. <a ref='Lu 1'>1</a> ; <a ref='Lu 2'>2</a> ), to the events of resurrection morning, where women again are major characters ( <a ref='Luke 24:1'>24:1</a> , <a ref='Luke 24:10'>10</a> ), Luke emphasized the central role of women in the life and ministry of our Lord (e.g., <a ref='Luke 7:12–15'>7:12–15</a> , <a ref='Luke 7:37–50'>37–50</a> ; <a ref='Luke 8:2–3'>8:2–3</a> , <a ref='Luke 8:43–48'>43–48</a> ; <a ref='Luke 10:38–42'>10:38–42</a> ; <a ref='Luke 13:11–13'>13:11–13</a> ; <a ref='Luke 21:2–4'>21:2–4</a> ; <a ref='Luke 23:27–29'>23:27–29</a> , <a ref='Luke 23:49'>49</a> , <a ref='Luke 23:55–56'>55–56</a> ). Several other recurring themes form threads through Luke’s Gospel. Examples of these are human fear in the presence of God ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 1:12'>1:12</a></i> ); forgiveness ( <a ref='Luke 3:3'>3:3</a> ; <a ref='Luke 5:20–25'>5:20–25</a> ; <a ref='Luke 6:37'>6:37</a> ; <a ref='Luke 7:41–50'>7:41–50</a> ; <a ref='Luke 11:4'>11:4</a> ; <a ref='Luke 12:10'>12:10</a> ; <a ref='Luke 17:3–4'>17:3–4</a> ; <a ref='Luke 23:34'>23:34</a> ; <a ref='Luke 24:47'>24:47</a> ); joy ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 1:14'>1:14</a></i> ); wonder at the mysteries of divine truth ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 2:18'>2:18</a></i> ); the role of the Holy Spirit ( <a ref='Luke 1:15'>1:15</a> , <a ref='Luke 1:35'>35</a> , <a ref='Luke 1:41'>41</a> , <a ref='Luke 1:67'>67</a> ; <a ref='Luke 2:25–27'>2:25–27</a> ; <a ref='Luke 3:16'>3:16</a> , <a ref='Luke 3:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Luke 4:1'>4:1</a> , <a ref='Luke 4:14'>14</a> , <a ref='Luke 4:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Luke 10:21'>10:21</a> ; <a ref='Luke 11:13'>11:13</a> ; <a ref='Luke 12:10'>12:10</a> , <a ref='Luke 12:12'>12</a> ); the temple in Jerusalem ( <a ref='Luke 1:9–22'>1:9–22</a> ; <a ref='Luke 2:27–38'>2:27–38</a> , <a ref='Luke 2:46–49'>46–49</a> ; <a ref='Luke 4:9–13'>4:9–13</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:10–14'>18:10–14</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:45–48'>19:45–48</a> ; <a ref='Luke 20:1–21:6'>20:1—21:6</a> ; <a ref='Luke 21:37–38'>21:37–38</a> ; <a ref='Luke 24:53'>24:53</a> ); and Jesus’ prayers ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 6:12'>6:12</a></i> ). Starting with <a ref='Luke 9:51'>9:51</a> , Luke devoted 10 chapters of his narrative to a travelogue of Jesus’ final journey to Jerusalem. Much of the material in this section is unique to Luke. This is the heart of Luke’s Gospel, and it features a theme Luke stressed throughout: Jesus’ relentless progression toward the cross. This was the very purpose for which Christ had come to earth (cf. <a ref='Luke 9:22–23'>9:22–23</a> ; <a ref='Luke 17:25'>17:25</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:31–33'>18:31–33</a> ; <a ref='Luke 24:25–26'>24:25–26</a> , <a ref='Luke 24:46'>46</a> ), and He would not be deterred. The saving of sinners was His whole mission ( <a ref='Luke 19:10'>19:10</a> ). Interpretive Challenges Luke, like Mark, and in contrast to Matthew, appears to target a Gentile readership (for a discussion of the Synoptic Problem, see Introduction to Mark: Interpretive Challenges ). He identified locations that would have been familiar to all Jews (e.g., <a ref='Luke 4:31'>4:31</a> ; <a ref='Luke 23:51'>23:51</a> ; <a ref='Luke 24:13'>24:13</a> ), suggesting that his audience went beyond those who already had knowledge of Palestinian geography. He usually preferred Greek terminology over Hebraisms (e.g., “The Skull” instead of “Golgotha” in <a ref='Luke 23:33'>23:33</a> ). The other Gospels all use occasional Semitic terms such as “Abba” ( <a ref='Mark 14:36'>Mk 14:36</a> ), “rabbi” ( <a ref='Matthew 23:7–8'>Mt 23:7–8</a> ; <a ref='John 1:38'>Jn 1:38</a> , <a ref='John 1:49'>49</a> ), and “hosanna” ( <a ref='Matthew 21:9'>Mt 21:9</a> ; <a ref='Mark 11:9–10'>Mk 11:9–10</a> ; <a ref='John 12:13'>Jn 12:13</a> )—but Luke either omitted them or used Greek equivalents. Luke quoted the OT more sparingly than Matthew, and when citing OT passages, he nearly always employed the LXX, a Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures. Furthermore, most of Luke’s OT citations are allusions rather than direct quotations, and many of them appear in Jesus’ words rather than Luke’s narration ( <a ref='Luke 2:23–24'>2:23–24</a> ; <a ref='Luke 3:4–6'>3:4–6</a> ; <a ref='Luke 4:4'>4:4</a> , <a ref='Luke 4:8'>8</a> , <a ref='Luke 4:10–12'>10–12</a> , <a ref='Luke 4:18–19'>18–19</a> ; <a ref='Luke 7:27'>7:27</a> ; <a ref='Luke 10:27'>10:27</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:20'>18:20</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:46'>19:46</a> ; <a ref='Luke 20:17–18'>20:17–18</a> , <a ref='Luke 20:37'>37</a> , <a ref='Luke 20:42–43'>42–43</a> ; <a ref='Luke 22:37'>22:37</a> ). Luke, more than any of the other Gospel writers, highlighted the universal scope of the gospel invitation. He portrayed Jesus as the Son of Man, rejected by Israel, and then offered to the world. As noted above (see Historical and Theological Themes), Luke repeatedly related accounts of Gentiles, Samaritans, and other outcasts who found grace in Jesus’ eyes. This emphasis is precisely what we would expect from a close companion of the “apostle of Gentiles” ( <a ref='Romans 11:13'>Ro 11:13</a> ). Yet some critics have claimed to see a wide gap between Luke’s theology and that of Paul. It is true that Luke’s Gospel is practically devoid of terminology that is uniquely Pauline. Luke wrote with his own style. Yet the underlying theology is perfectly in harmony with that of the apostle’s. The centerpiece of Paul’s doctrine was justification by faith ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 3:24'>Ro 3:24</a></i> ). Luke also highlighted and illustrated justification by faith in many of the incidents and parables he related, chiefly the account of the Pharisee and the publican ( <a ref='Luke 18:9–14'>18:9–14</a> ); the familiar story of the Prodigal Son ( <a ref='Luke 15:11–32'>15:11–32</a> ); the incident at Simon’s house ( <a ref='Luke 7:36–50'>7:36–50</a> ); and the salvation of Zacchaeus ( <a ref='Luke 19:1–10'>19:1–10</a> ).

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Luke 1:1–4'>1:1–4</a> These 4 verses make a single sentence, written in the polished style of a Greek literary classic. It was common for Greek historical works to begin with such a prologue. After this formal prologue, however, Luke shifted into a simpler style of narrative, probably patterned after the familiar style of the LXX. <a ref='Luke 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>many.</b> Although Luke wrote direct divine revelation inspired by the Holy Spirit, he acknowledged the works of others ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:2'>2</a></i> ) who had set down in writing events from Christ’s life. All those sources have been long lost, except for the inspired Gospels. Since Matthew and Mark were most likely written before Luke, it has been suggested that either one or both of those may have been among Luke’s sources when he did his research. It is also known that he was personally acquainted with many firsthand witnesses to the events of Christ’s life. And it is possible that some of his sources were word-of-mouth reports. About 60 percent of the material in Mark is repeated in Luke, and Luke seems to follow Mark’s order of events closely (see Introduction to Mark: Interpretive Challenges, the Synoptic Problem ). <b>compile an account.</b> Luke proposed to narrate the ministry of Christ in an authoritative, logical, and factual order (though not always strictly chronological—v. <a ref='Luke 1:3'>3</a> ). <b>the things that have been fulfilled.</b> I.e., the OT messianic promises fulfilled in Christ. <b>among us.</b> I.e., in our generation. This phrase does not mean Luke was personally an eyewitness to the life of Christ ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:2'>2</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>eyewitnesses and servants of the word.</b> Luke’s primary sources were the apostles themselves, who delivered facts about Jesus’ life and teaching—both orally and by means of recorded memoirs in written documents made available to Luke. In any case, Luke made no pretense of being an eyewitness himself, but explained that these were facts supported by careful research ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:3'>3</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>having investigated … carefully.</b> Lit. “having traced out carefully.” Luke’s Gospel was the result of painstaking investigation. Luke, more than anyone else in the early church, had the abilities and the opportunity to consult with eye-witnesses of Jesus’ ministry and consolidate their accounts. He spent more than two years during Paul’s imprisonment at Caesarea ( <a ref='Acts 24:26–27'>Ac 24:26–27</a> ), during which time he would have been able to meet and interview many of the apostles and other eyewitnesses of Jesus’ ministry. We know, for example, that he met Philip ( <a ref='Acts 21:8'>Ac 21:8</a> ), who was undoubtedly one of Luke’s sources. In his travels, he may also have encountered the apostle John. Joanna, wife of Herod’s steward, is mentioned only in Luke’s Gospel ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 8:3'>8:3</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Luke 24:10'>24:10</a> ), so she must have been a personal acquaintance of his. Luke also related details about Herod’s dealings with Christ not found in the other Gospels ( <a ref='Luke 13:31–33'>13:31–33</a> ; <a ref='Luke 23:7–12'>23:7–12</a> ). No doubt it was from Joanna (or someone in a similar position) that Luke learned those facts. However, his understanding was perfect because of the divine revelation he received from the Holy Spirit ( <a ref='2 Timothy 3:16–17'>2Ti 3:16–17</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 1:19–21'>2Pe 1:19–21</a> ). <b>from the beginning.</b> This could mean from the beginning of Christ’s earthly life. However, the word can mean from above ( <a ref='John 3:31'>Jn 3:31</a> ; <a ref='John 19:11'>19:11</a> ; <a ref='James 3:15'>Jas 3:15</a> ). From the beginning in v. <a ref='Luke 1:2'>2</a> uses a different Greek word, <i>archē</i> —so it is best to understand that Luke was saying he used earthly sources for his material, but was given heavenly guidance as he did his research and writing. It is clear that he regarded his account as authoritative ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:4'>4</a></i> ). <b>in orderly sequence.</b> Luke’s account is predominantly ordered chronologically, but he does not follow such an arrangement slavishly. <b>most excellent.</b> This was a title used to address governors ( <a ref='Acts 23:26'>Ac 23:26</a> ; <a ref='Acts 24:3'>24:3</a> ; <a ref='Acts 26:25'>26:25</a> ). This sort of language was reserved for the highest dignitaries, suggesting that “Theophilus” was such a person. <a ref='Luke 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>the certainty.</b> Note the implicit claim of authority. Though Luke drew from other sources (v. <a ref='Luke 1:3'>3</a> ), he regarded the reliability and authority of his Gospel as superior to uninspired sources. <b>taught.</b> Theophilus had been schooled in the apostolic tradition, possibly even by the apostle Paul himself. Yet the written Scripture by means of this Gospel sealed the certainty of what he had heard. <a ref='Luke 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>Herod.</b> Herod the Great. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 2:1'>Mt 2:1</a> .</i> <b>Zechariah.</b> Lit. “Jehovah has remembered.” <b>the division of Abijah.</b> The temple priesthood was organized into 24 divisions, with each division serving twice a year for one week ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 24:4–19'>1Chr 24:4–19</a> ); Abijah’s was the 8th division ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 24:10'>1Chr 24:10</a> ). <b>daughters of Aaron.</b> I.e., both husband and wife were from the priestly tribe. <a ref='Luke 1:6'>1:6</a> <b>both righteous in the sight of God.</b> I.e., they were believers, justified in God’s sight. There is a clear echo of Pauline theology in this expression. See Introduction: Interpretive Challenges . <a ref='Luke 1:7'>1:7</a> <b>barren … advanced in years.</b> This was seen by many as a sign of divine disfavor. <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:25'>25</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>in the order of his division.</b> I.e., his division was on duty for one of their two annual stints ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:5'>5</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>chosen by lot to … burn incense.</b> A high honor ( <a ref='Exodus 30:7–8'>Ex 30:7–8</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 29:11'>2Chr 29:11</a> ). Because of the large number of priests, most would never be chosen for such a duty, and no one was permitted to serve in this capacity twice. Zacharias no doubt regarded this as the supreme moment in a lifetime of priestly service. The incense was kept burning perpetually, just in front of the veil that divided the holy place from the most holy place. The lone priest would offer the incense every morning and every evening, while the rest of the priests and worshipers stood outside the holy place in prayer (v. <a ref='Luke 1:10'>10</a> ). <a ref='Luke 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>fear.</b> The normal response—and an appropriate one ( <a ref='Luke 12:5'>12:5</a> )—when someone is confronted by a divine visitation or a mighty work of God ( <a ref='Judges 6:22'>Jdg 6:22</a> ; <a ref='Judges 13:22'>13:22</a> ; <a ref='Mark 16:5'>Mk 16:5</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 1:17'>Rev 1:17</a></i> ). Luke seems especially to take note of this; he often reports fear in the presence of God and His works (cf. vv. <a ref='Luke 1:30'>30</a> , <a ref='Luke 1:65'>65</a> ; <a ref='Luke 2:9–10'>2:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Luke 5:10'>5:10</a> , <a ref='Luke 5:26'>26</a> ; <a ref='Luke 7:16'>7:16</a> ; <a ref='Luke 8:25'>8:25</a> , <a ref='Luke 8:37'>37</a> , <a ref='Luke 8:50'>50</a> ; <a ref='Luke 9:34'>9:34</a> , <a ref='Luke 9:45'>45</a> ; <a ref='Luke 23:40'>23:40</a> ). <a ref='Luke 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>your prayer.</b> Probably a prayer for children to be in his home ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:7'>7</a></i> ; cf. v. <a ref='Luke 1:25'>25</a> ). <b>John.</b> Lit. “Jehovah has shown grace.” <a ref='Luke 1:14'>1:14</a> <b>joy and gladness.</b> The hallmarks of the messianic kingdom ( <a ref='Isaiah 25:9'>Is 25:9</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 14:7'>Pss 14:7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 48:11'>48:11</a> ). The motif of joy runs through Luke’s Gospel (cf. vv. <a ref='Luke 1:44'>44</a> , <a ref='Luke 1:47'>47</a> , <a ref='Luke 1:58'>58</a> ; <a ref='Luke 2:10'>2:10</a> ; <a ref='Luke 6:23'>6:23</a> ; <a ref='Luke 8:13'>8:13</a> ; <a ref='Luke 10:17–21'>10:17–21</a> ; <a ref='Luke 13:17'>13:17</a> ; <a ref='Luke 15:5–10'>15:5–10</a> , <a ref='Luke 15:22–32'>22–32</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:6'>19:6</a> , <a ref='Luke 19:37'>37</a> ; <a ref='Luke 24:52'>24:52</a> ). <a ref='Luke 1:15'>1:15</a> not drink any wine or strong drink <b>.</b> This was a key element of the Nazirite vow ( <a ref='Numbers 6:1–21'>Nu 6:1–21</a> ) and would probably have been understood as such by Zacharias. Usually such a vow was temporary, but Samson ( <a ref='Judges 16:17'>Jdg 16:17</a> ) and Samuel ( <a ref='1 Samuel 1:11'>1Sa 1:11</a> ) were subject to it from birth. The language here is reminiscent of the angel’s instructions to Samson’s parents ( <a ref='Judges 13:4–7'>Jdg 13:4–7</a> ). However, no mention is made here of any restriction on the cutting of John’s hair. Luke may have simply omitted that detail to avoid weighing his Gentile audience down with the details of Jewish law. <b>while yet in his mother’s womb.</b> Reminiscent of Jeremiah ( <a ref='Jeremiah 1:5'>Jer 1:5</a> ). This illustrates God’s sovereignty in salvation. <a ref='Luke 1:17'>1:17</a> <b>in the spirit and power of Elijah.</b> Elijah, like John the Baptist, was known for his bold, uncompromising stand for the Word of God—even in the face of a ruthless monarch (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 18:17–24'>1Ki 18:17–24</a> ; <a ref='Mark 6:15'>Mk 6:15</a> ). The final two verses of the OT ( <a ref='Malachi 4:5–6'>Mal 4:5–6</a> ) had promised the return of Elijah before the day of the Lord. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 3:4'>Mt 3:4</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 11:14'>11:14</a> ; <a ref='Mark 9:11–12'>Mk 9:11–12</a> .</i> to turn the hearts <b>.</b> Quoted from <a ref='Malachi 4:6'>Mal 4:6</a> , showing that John the Baptist fulfilled that prophecy. <b>make ready.</b> Possibly an allusion to <a ref='Isaiah 40:3–5'>Is 40:3–5</a> ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Luke 3:4'>3:4</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 3:3'>Mt 3:3</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 1:18'>1:18</a> <b>How will I know this?</b> Abraham also asked for a sign under similar circumstances ( <a ref='Genesis 15:8'>Ge 15:8</a> ). The sign given Zacharias was also a mild rebuke for doubting (v. <a ref='Luke 1:20'>20</a> ). <a ref='Luke 1:19'>1:19</a> <b>Gabriel.</b> Lit. “strong man of God.” Gabriel also appears in <a ref='Daniel 8:16'>Da 8:16</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:21'>9:21</a> ( <i>see notes there</i> ). He is one of only two holy angels whose names are given in Scripture, the other being Michael ( <a ref='Daniel 10:13'>Da 10:13</a> , <a ref='Daniel 10:21'>21</a> ; <a ref='Jude 1:9'>Jd 9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:7'>Rev 12:7</a> ). <a ref='Luke 1:21'>1:21</a> <b>wondering at his delay.</b> Zacharias was only supposed to offer incense, then come out to pronounce the familiar blessing of <a ref='Numbers 6:23–27'>Nu 6:23–27</a> on the people who were waiting in the temple court. The conversation with the angel would have taken additional time. <a ref='Luke 1:23'>1:23</a> <b>the days of his priestly service.</b> A week. <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:5'>5</a> .</i> <b>went back home.</b> In the hill country of Judea (v. <a ref='Luke 1:39'>39</a> ). <a ref='Luke 1:24'>1:24</a> <b>kept herself in seclusion.</b> Probably an act of devotion out of deep gratitude to the Lord. <a ref='Luke 1:25'>1:25</a> <b>my disgrace.</b> Childlessness carried a reproach in a culture where blessings were tied to birthrights and family lines. Barrenness could occasionally be a sign of divine disfavor ( <a ref='Leviticus 20:20–21'>Lv 20:20–21</a> ), but it was not always so (cf. <a ref='Genesis 30:23'>Ge 30:23</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 1:5–10'>1Sa 1:5–10</a> ). Still, it carried a social stigma that could be humiliating. <a ref='Luke 1:26'>1:26</a> <b>in the sixth month.</b> I.e., Elizabeth’s sixth month of pregnancy. <b>Nazareth.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 2:23'>Mt 2:23</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 1:27'>1:27</a> <b>a virgin.</b> The importance of the virgin birth cannot be overstated. A right view of the incarnation hinges on the truth that Jesus was virgin-born. Both Luke and Matthew expressly state that Mary was a virgin when Jesus was conceived ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 1:23'>Mt 1:23</a></i> ). The Holy Spirit wrought the conception through supernatural means ( <i>see notes on v. <a ref='Luke 1:35'>35</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 1:18'>Mt 1:18</a></i> ). The nature of Christ’s conception testifies of both His deity and His sinlessness. <b>betrothed.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 1:18–19'>Mt 1:18–19</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 1:28'>1:28</a> <b>favored one!</b> Lit. “full of grace”—a term used of all believers in <a ref='Ephesians 1:6'>Eph 1:6</a> , where it is translated “bestowed.” This portrays Mary as a recipient, not a dispenser, of divine grace. <a ref='Luke 1:30'>1:30</a> <b>Do not be afraid.</b> The same thing Gabriel had said to Zacharias (v. <a ref='Luke 1:13'>13</a> ). <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:12'>12</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 1:31'>1:31</a> <b>Jesus.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 1:1'>Mt 1:1</a> , <a ref='Matthew 1:21'>21</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 1:32'>1:32</a> <b>He will be great.</b> This same promise was made of John the Baptist. However, the subsequent title is what set Jesus apart. <b>the Son of the Most High.</b> Cf. v. <a ref='Luke 1:76'>76</a> , where John the Baptist is called “the prophet of the Most High.” The Greek term Luke uses for “Most High” is the one employed in the LXX to translate the Hebrew, “The Most High God.” Since a son bears his father’s qualities, calling a person someone else’s “son” was a way of signifying equality. Here the angel was telling Mary that her Son would be equal to the Most High God. <b>His father David.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 9:27'>Mt 9:27</a> .</i> Jesus was David’s physical descendant through Mary’s line. David’s “throne” was emblematic of the messianic kingdom (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 7:13–16'>2Sa 7:13–16</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:26–29'>Ps 89:26–29</a> ). <a ref='Luke 1:33'>1:33</a> <b>over the house of Jacob forever.</b> This emphasizes both the Jewish character of the millennial kingdom and the eternal permanence of Christ’s rule over all. <i>See notes on <a ref='Isaiah 9:7'>Is 9:7</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 2:44'>Da 2:44</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 1:34'>1:34</a> <b>I am a virgin.</b> Mary understood that the angel was speaking of an immediate conception, and she and Joseph were still in the midst of the long betrothal, or engagement period ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 1:18'>Mt 1:18</a></i> ), before the actual marriage and consummation. Her question was borne out of wonder, not doubt, nor disbelief, so the angel did not rebuke her as he had Zacharias (v. <a ref='Luke 1:20'>20</a> ). <a ref='Luke 1:35'>1:35</a> <b>The Holy Spirit will come upon you.</b> This was a creative act of the Holy Spirit, not the sort of divine-human cohabitation sometimes seen in pagan mythology. <a ref='Luke 1:36'>1:36</a> <b>your relative Elizabeth.</b> It seems most reasonable to regard the genealogy of <a ref='Luke 3:23–38'>3:23–38</a> as Mary’s ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 3:23'>3:23</a></i> ). This would make her a direct descendant of David ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:32'>32</a></i> ). Yet, Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:5'>5</a></i> ). Therefore, Mary must have been related to Elizabeth through her mother, who would have been of Aaronic descent. Thus, Mary was a descendant of David through her father. <a ref='Luke 1:38'>1:38</a> <b>may it be done to me according to your word.</b> Mary was in an extremely embarrassing and difficult position. Betrothed to Joseph, she faced the stigma of unwed motherhood. Joseph would obviously have known that the child was not his. She knew she would be accused of adultery—an offense punishable by stoning ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:13–21'>Dt 22:13–21</a> ; cf. <a ref='John 8:3–5'>Jn 8:3–5</a> ). Yet she willingly and graciously submitted to the will of God. <a ref='Luke 1:41'>1:41</a> <b>filled with the Holy Spirit.</b> I.e., controlled by the Holy Spirit, who undoubtedly guided Elizabeth’s remarkable expression of praise. <i>See notes on vv. <a ref='Luke 1:43–44'>43–44</a> , <a ref='Luke 1:67'>67</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 1:43'>1:43</a> <b>the mother of my Lord.</b> This expression is not in praise of Mary, but in praise of the Child whom she bore. It was a profound expression of Elizabeth’s confidence that Mary’s Child would be the long-hoped-for Messiah—the one whom even David called “Lord” (cf. <a ref='Luke 20:44'>20:44</a> ). Elizabeth’s grasp of the situation was extraordinary, considering the aura of mystery that overshadowed all these events (cf. <a ref='Luke 2:19'>2:19</a> ). She greeted Mary not with skepticism but with joy. She understood the response of the child in her own womb. And she seemed to comprehend the immense importance of the Child whom Mary was carrying. All of this must be attributed to the illuminating work of the Spirit (v. <a ref='Luke 1:41'>41</a> ). <a ref='Luke 1:44'>1:44</a> <b>the baby leaped in my womb for joy.</b> The infant, like his mother, was Spirit-filled (cf. vv. <a ref='Luke 1:15'>15</a> , <a ref='Luke 1:41'>41</a> ). His response, like that of Elizabeth, was supernaturally prompted by the Spirit of God ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:41'>41</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 1:46–55'>1:46–55</a> Mary’s <i>Magnificat</i> (the first word in the Latin translation; <i>see notes on vv. <a ref='Luke 1:68–79'>68–79</a> ; <a ref='Luke 2:29–32'>2:29–32</a></i> ) is filled with OT allusions and quotations. It reveals that Mary’s heart and mind were saturated with the Word of God. It contains repeated echoes of Hannah’s prayers, e.g., <a ref='1 Samuel 1:11'>1Sa 1:11</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 2:1–10'>2:1–10</a> . These verses also contain numerous allusions to the law, the psalms, and the prophets. The entire passage is a point-by-point reciting of the covenant promises of God. <a ref='Luke 1:47'>1:47</a> <b>my Savior.</b> Mary referred to God as “Savior,” indicating both that she recognized her own need of a Savior, and that she knew the true God as her Savior. Nothing here or anywhere else in Scripture indicates Mary thought of herself as “immaculate” (free from the taint of original sin). Quite the opposite is true; she employed language typical of someone whose only hope for salvation is divine grace. Nothing in this passage lends support to the notion that Mary herself ought to be an object of adoration. <a ref='Luke 1:48'>1:48</a> <b>humble state.</b> The quality of Mary that shines most clearly through this passage is a deep sense of humility. <a ref='Luke 1:56'>1:56</a> <b>about three months.</b> Mary arrived in the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy (v. <a ref='Luke 1:26'>26</a> ), so she evidently stayed until John the Baptist was born. <b>her home.</b> At this point Mary was still betrothed to Joseph, not yet living in his house (cf. <a ref='Matthew 1:24'>Mt 1:24</a> ). <a ref='Luke 1:59'>1:59</a> <b>the eighth day.</b> In accord with God’s commandment ( <a ref='Genesis 17:12'>Ge 17:12</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 12:1–3'>Lv 12:1–3</a> ; cf. <a ref='Philippians 3:5'>Php 3:5</a> ), it had become customary to name a child at circumcision. The ritual brought together family and friends, who in this case, pressured the parents to name the baby “after his father”—probably intending this as a gesture of respect to Zacharias. <a ref='Luke 1:60'>1:60</a> <b>No.</b> Elizabeth had learned from Zacharias in writing (v. <a ref='Luke 1:63'>63</a> ), everything Gabriel had said to him. <a ref='Luke 1:62'>1:62</a> <b>were making signs to his father.</b> The priests conducting the circumcision ceremony appear to have assumed that since he could not speak he was also deaf. <a ref='Luke 1:65'>1:65</a> <b>fear.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:12'>12</a> .</i> <b>all the hill country of Judea.</b> I.e., Jerusalem and the surrounding area. John the Baptist’s reputation began to spread from the time of his birth (v. <a ref='Luke 1:66'>66</a> ). <a ref='Luke 1:67'>1:67</a> <b>filled with the Holy Spirit.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:41'>41</a> .</i> In every case where someone was Spirit-filled in Luke’s nativity account, the result was Spirit-directed worship. Cf. <a ref='Ephesians 5:18–20'>Eph 5:18–20</a> . <a ref='Luke 1:68–79'>1:68–79</a> This passage is known as the <i>Benedictus</i> (the first word of v. <a ref='Luke 1:68'>68</a> in the Latin translation; <i>see notes on vv. <a ref='Luke 1:46–55'>46–55</a> ; <a ref='Luke 2:29–32'>2:29–32</a></i> ). Like Mary’s <i>Magnificat</i> , it is liberally sprinkled with OT quotations and allusions. When Zacharias was struck mute in the temple (v. <a ref='Luke 1:20'>20</a> ), he was supposed to deliver a benediction ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:21'>21</a></i> ). So it is fitting that when his speech was restored, the first words out of his mouth were this inspired benediction. <a ref='Luke 1:69'>1:69</a> <b>horn of salvation.</b> A common expression in the OT ( <a ref='2 Samuel 22:3'>2Sa 22:3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 18:2'>Ps 18:2</a> ; cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:1'>1Sa 2:1</a> ). The horn is a symbol of strength ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:17'>Dt 33:17</a> ). These words were clearly not meant to exalt John the Baptist. Since both Zacharias and Elizabeth were Levites ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:5'>5</a></i> ), the One raised up “in the house of David” could not be John, but spoke of Someone greater than he ( <a ref='John 1:26–27'>Jn 1:26–27</a> ). Verses <a ref='Luke 1:76–79'>76–79</a> speak of John’s role. <a ref='Luke 1:72'>1:72</a> <b>His holy covenant.</b> I.e., the Abrahamic Covenant (v. <a ref='Luke 1:73'>73</a> ), with its promise of salvation by grace. <i>See note on <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 1:76'>1:76</a> <b>the prophet of the Most High.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:32'>32</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 1:77'>1:77</a> <b>the forgiveness of their sins.</b> Forgiveness of sins is the heart of salvation. God saves sinners from separation from Him and from eternal hell only by atoning for and forgiving their sins. <i>See notes on <a ref='Romans 4:6–8'>Ro 4:6–8</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:19'>2Co 5:19</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:7'>Eph 1:7</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:22'>Heb 9:22</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 1:78'>1:78</a> <b>Sunrise.</b> A messianic reference (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 9:2'>Is 9:2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:1–3'>60:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 4:2'>Mal 4:2</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 1:19'>2Pe 1:19</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 22:16'>Rev 22:16</a> ). <a ref='Luke 1:80'>1:80</a> <b>lived in the desolate regions.</b> Several groups of ascetics inhabited the wilderness regions east of Jerusalem. One was the famous Qumran community, source of the Dead Sea Scrolls. John’s parents, already old when he was born, might have given him over to the care of someone with ties to such a community. In a similar way, Hannah consecrated Samuel to the Lord by entrusting him to Eli ( <a ref='1 Samuel 1:22–28'>1Sa 1:22–28</a> ). However, there is nothing concrete in Scripture to suggest that John was part of any such group. On the contrary, he is painted as a solitary figure, in the spirit of Elijah. <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 1:17'>17</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>Caesar Augustus.</b> Caius Octavius, grand-nephew, adopted son, and primary heir to Julius Caesar. Before and after Julius’ death in 44 BC, the Roman government was constantly torn by power struggles. Octavius ascended to undisputed supremacy in 31 BC by defeating his last remaining rival, Antony, in a military battle at Actium. In 29 BC, the Roman senate declared Octavius Rome’s first emperor. Two years later they honored him with the title “Augustus” (“exalted one”—a term signifying religious veneration). Rome’s republican government was effectively abolished, and Augustus was given supreme military power. He reigned until his death at age 76 (AD 14). Under his rule, the Roman Empire dominated the Mediterranean region, ushering in a period of great prosperity and relative peace (the <i>Pax Romana</i> ). He ordered “all the inhabited earth” (i.e., the world of the Roman Empire) to be counted. This was not merely a one-time census; the decree actually established a cycle of enrollments that were to occur every 14 years. Israel had previously been excluded from the Roman census, because Jews were exempt from serving in the Roman army, and the census was designed primarily to register young men for military service (as well as account for all Roman citizens). This new, universal census was ostensibly to number each nation by family and tribe (hence Joseph, a Judean, had to return to his ancestral home to register— <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 2:3'>3</a></i> ). Property and income values were not recorded in this registration. But soon the names and population statistics gathered in this census were used for the levying of poll taxes ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 22:17'>Mt 22:17</a></i> ), and the Jews came to regard the census itself as a distasteful symbol of Roman oppression. <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 2:2'>2</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>Quirinius was governor of Syria.</b> Fixing a precise date for this census is problematic. Publius Sulpicius Quirinius is known to have governed Syria during AD 6–9. A well-known census was taken in Palestine in AD 6. Josephus records that it sparked a violent Jewish revolt (mentioned by Luke, quoting Gamaliel, in <a ref='Acts 5:37'>Ac 5:37</a> ). Quirinius was responsible for administering that census, and he also played a major role in quelling the subsequent rebellion. However, that cannot be the census Luke has in mind here, because it occurred about a decade after the death of Herod ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 2:1'>Mt 2:1</a></i> )—much too late to fit Luke’s chronology (cf. <a ref='Luke 1:5'>1:5</a> ). In light of Luke’s meticulous care as a historian, it would be unreasonable to charge him with such an obvious anachronism. Indeed, archeology has vindicated Luke. A fragment of stone discovered at Tivoli (near Rome) in AD 1764 contains an inscription in honor of a Roman official who, it states, was twice governor of Syria and Phoenicia during the reign of Augustus. The name of the official is not on the fragment, but among his accomplishments are listed details that, as far as is known, can fit no one other than Quirinius. Thus, he must have served as governor in Syria twice. He was probably military governor at the same time that history records Varus was civil governor there. With regard to the dating of the census, some ancient records found in Egypt mention a worldwide census ordered in 8 BC. That date is not without problems, either. It is generally thought by scholars that 6 BC is the earliest possible date for Christ’s birth. Evidently, the census was ordered by Caesar Augustus in 8 BC but was not actually carried out in Palestine until 2–4 years later, perhaps because of political difficulties between Rome and Herod. Therefore, the precise year of Christ’s birth cannot be known with certainty, but it was probably no earlier than 6 BC and certainly no later than 4 BC. Luke’s readers, familiar with the political history of that era, would no doubt have been able to discern a very precise date from the information he gave. <a ref='Luke 2:3'>2:3</a> <b>own city.</b> I.e., the place of tribal origin. <a ref='Luke 2:4'>2:4</a> <b>Nazareth … Bethlehem.</b> Both Joseph and Mary were descendants of David and therefore went to their tribal home in Judea to be registered. This was a difficult trek of more than 70 mi. through mountainous terrain—a particularly grueling journey for Mary, on the verge of delivery. Perhaps she and Joseph were conscious that a birth in Bethlehem would fulfill the prophecy in <a ref='Micah 5:2'>Mic 5:2</a> . <a ref='Luke 2:5'>2:5</a> <b>betrothed.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 1:18'>Mt 1:18</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 1:24'>Matthew 1:24</a> indicates that when the angel told Joseph about Mary’s pregnancy, he “took her as his wife”—i.e., he took her into his home. But they did not consummate their marriage until after the birth of Jesus ( <a ref='Matthew 1:25'>Mt 1:25</a> ). Therefore, technically, they were still betrothed. <a ref='Luke 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>firstborn.</b> Mary had other children subsequent to this. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 12:46'>Mt 12:46</a> .</i> <b>cloths.</b> Strips of cloth were used to bind a baby tightly. It kept the baby from injuring sensitive facial skin and eyes with its own (often sharp) fingernails, and was believed to strengthen the limbs. This is still the custom in some Eastern cultures. The absence of such cloths was a sign of poverty or lack of parental care ( <a ref='Ezekiel 16:4'>Eze 16:4</a> ). <b>manger.</b> A feeding trough for animals. This is the source of the notion that Christ was born in a stable, something nowhere stated in Scripture. Ancient tradition held that He was born in a cave (possibly one used as a shelter for animals). But no actual description of the location is given. <b>no place for them in the guest room.</b> Possibly because many were returning to this ancient town to register in the census. <a ref='Luke 2:8'>2:8</a> <b>shepherds.</b> Bethlehem was nearby Jerusalem, and many of the sheep used in the temple sacrifices came from there. The surrounding hills were prime grazing land, and shepherds worked in the area day and night, all year round. Therefore it is not possible to draw any conclusion about the time of year by the fact that shepherds were living out in the fields. <a ref='Luke 2:10'>2:10</a> <b>Do not be afraid.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 1:12'>1:12</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Luke 1:65'>1:65</a> . <a ref='Luke 2:11'>2:11</a> <b>city of David.</b> I.e., Bethlehem, the town where David was born—not the City of David, which was on the southern slope of Mt. Zion (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 5:7–9'>2Sa 5:7–9</a> ). <b>a Savior.</b> This is one of only two places in the Gospels where Christ is referred to as “Savior”—the other being <a ref='John 4:42'>Jn 4:42</a> , where the men of Sychar confessed Him as “Savior of the world.” <b>Christ.</b> “Christ” is the Greek equivalent of “Messiah” ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 1:1'>Mt 1:1</a></i> ). <b>Lord.</b> The Greek word can mean “master”—but it is also the word used to translate the covenant name of God. Here (and in most of its NT occurrences), it is used in the latter sense, as a title of deity. <a ref='Luke 2:13'>2:13</a> <b>host.</b> A term used to describe an army encampment. Christ also used military imagery to describe the angels in <a ref='Matthew 26:53'>Mt 26:53</a> ( <i>see note there</i> ). <a ref='Revelation 5:11'>Revelation 5:11</a> suggests that the number of the angelic host may be too large for the human mind to fathom. Note that here the heavenly army brought a message of peace (v. <a ref='Luke 2:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Luke 2:14'>2:14</a> <b>the highest.</b> I.e., heaven. <b>peace.</b> This is not to be taken as a universal declaration of peace toward all humanity.

Mary’s offering indicates that she and Joseph were poor (v. <a ref='Luke 2:24'>24</a> ). <b>to Jerusalem.</b> A journey of about 6 mi. from Bethlehem. <b>to present Him to the Lord.</b> The dedication of the firstborn son was also required by Moses’ law (v. <a ref='Luke 2:23'>23</a> , cf. <a ref='Exodus 13:2'>Ex 13:2</a> , <a ref='Exodus 13:12–15'>12–15</a> ). <a ref='Luke 2:24'>2:24</a> <b>A</b> pair of turtledoves <b>.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 2:22'>22</a> .</i> Quoted from <a ref='Leviticus 12:8'>Lv 12:8</a> . <a ref='Luke 2:25'>2:25</a> <b>Simeon.</b> He is mentioned nowhere else in Scripture. <b>the comfort of Israel.</b> A messianic title, evidently derived from verses like <a ref='Isaiah 25:9'>Is 25:9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 40:1–2'>40:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 66:1–11'>66:1–11</a> . <a ref='Luke 2:26'>2:26</a> <b>it had been revealed to him.</b> It is significant that with messianic expectation running so high (cf. <a ref='Luke 3:15'>3:15</a> ), and with the many OT prophecies that spoke of His coming, still only a handful of people realized the significance of Christ’s birth. Most of them, including Simeon, received some angelic message or other special revelation to make the fulfillment of the OT prophecies clear. <a ref='Luke 2:29–32'>2:29–32</a> Simeon’s psalm is known as the <i>Nunc Dimittis</i> , from the first two words of the Latin translation ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Luke 1:46–55'>1:46–55</a> ; <a ref='Luke 1:68–79'>1:68–79</a></i> ). It is the fourth of 5 psalms of praise Luke included in his birth narrative (see Introduction: Historical and Theological Themes ). It is a touching expression of Simeon’s extraordinary faith. <a ref='Luke 2:30'>2:30</a> <b>Your salvation.</b> I.e., the One who would redeem His people from their sins. <a ref='Luke 2:31'>2:31</a> <b>all peoples.</b> I.e., all nations, tongues, and tribes (cf. <a ref='Revelation 7:9'>Rev 7:9</a> )—both Israel and the Gentiles (v. <a ref='Luke 2:32'>32</a> ). <a ref='Luke 2:34'>2:34</a> <b>fall and rise of many in Israel.</b> To those who reject Him, He is a stone of stumbling ( <a ref='1 Peter 2:8'>1Pe 2:8</a> ); those who receive Him are raised up ( <a ref='Ephesians 2:6'>Eph 2:6</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 8:14–15'>Is 8:14–15</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 14:9'>Hos 14:9</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:23–24'>1Co 1:23–24</a> . <b>sign to be opposed.</b> This was synecdoche. Simeon mentioned only the verbal insults hurled at Christ, but the expression actually embraced more than that—Israel’s rejection, and hatred, and crucifixion of the Messiah. <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 2:35'>35</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 2:35'>2:35</a> <b>a sword.</b> This was undoubtedly a reference to the personal grief Mary would endure when she watched her own Son die in agony ( <a ref='John 19:25'>Jn 19:25</a> ). <b>that the thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.</b> The rejection of the Messiah ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 2:34'>34</a></i> ) would reveal the appalling truth about the apostate state of the Jews. <a ref='Luke 2:36'>2:36</a> <b>a prophetess.</b> This refers to a woman who spoke God’s Word. She was a teacher of the OT, not a source of revelation. The OT mentions only 3 women who prophesied: Miriam ( <a ref='Exodus 15:20'>Ex 15:20</a> ); Deborah ( <a ref='Judges 4:4'>Jdg 4:4</a> ); Huldah ( <a ref='2 Kings 22:14'>2Ki 22:14</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 34:22'>2Chr 34:22</a> ). One other, the “prophetess” Noadiah, was evidently a false prophet, grouped by Nehemiah with his enemies. <a ref='Isaiah 8:3'>Isaiah 8:3</a> refers to the prophet’s wife as a “prophetess”—but there is no evidence Isaiah’s wife prophesied. Perhaps she is so-called because the child she bore was given a name that was prophetic ( <a ref='Isaiah 8:3–4'>Is 8:3–4</a> ). This use of the title for Isaiah’s wife also shows that the title does not necessarily indicate an ongoing revelatory prophetic ministry. Rabbinical tradition also regarded Sarah, Hannah, Abigail, and Esther as prophetesses (apparently to make an even 7 with Miriam, Deborah, and Huldah). In the NT, the daughters of Philip prophesied ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 21:9'>Ac 21:9</a></i> ). New Testament Women Mary, the virgin mother of Jesus, has a place of honor among the women of the New Testament. She is an enduring example of faith, humility, and service ( <a ref='Luke 1:26–56'>Lk 1:26–56</a> ).

There would have been several such dwelling places for priests in the outer court, and Anna must have been allowed to live there permanently because of her unusual status as a prophetess. <a ref='Luke 2:39'>2:39</a> <b>they returned to Galilee.</b> Luke omitted the visit of the Magi and the flight into Egypt ( <a ref='Matthew 2:1–18'>Mt 2:1–18</a> ). The theme of early rejection, so prominent in Matthew (see Introduction to Matthew: Historical and Theological Themes ), was not where Luke focused his attention. <a ref='Luke 2:41'>2:41</a> <b>Feast of the Passover.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Exodus 23:14–19'>Ex 23:14–19</a> .</i> Passover was a one-day feast, followed immediately by the week-long Feast of Unleavened Bread ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 26:17'>Mt 26:17</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 2:43'>2:43</a> <b>Jesus stayed behind.</b> In stark contrast to the apocryphal Gospels’ spurious tales of youthful miracles and supernatural exploits, this lone biblical insight into the youth of Jesus portrays Him as a typical boy in a typical family. His lingering was neither mischievous nor disobedient; it was owing to a simple mistaken presumption on His parents’ part (v. <a ref='Luke 2:44'>44</a> ) that He was left behind. <a ref='Luke 2:44'>2:44</a> <b>in the caravan.</b> Obviously, Joseph and Mary were traveling with a large caravan of friends and relatives from Nazareth. No doubt hundreds of people from their community went together to the feast. Men and women in such a group might have been separated by some distance, and it appears each parent thought He was with the other. <a ref='Luke 2:46'>2:46</a> <b>three days.</b> This probably does not mean they searched Jerusalem for 3 days. They apparently realized He was missing at the end of a full day’s travel. That required another full day’s journey back to Jerusalem, and the better part of another day was spent seeking Him. <b>listening to them and asking them questions.</b> The boy Jesus was utterly respectful, taking the role of the student. But even at that young age, His questions showed a wisdom that put the teachers to shame. <a ref='Luke 2:48'>2:48</a> <b>why have You treated us this way?</b> Mary’s words convey a tone of exasperation and rebuke—normal for any mother under such circumstances, but misplaced in this case. Jesus was not hiding from them or defying their authority. In fact, He had done precisely what any child should do under such circumstances (being left by His parents)—He went to a safe, public place, in the presence of trusted adults, where His parents could be expected to come looking for Him (v. <a ref='Luke 2:49'>49</a> ). <b>Your father.</b> I.e., Joseph, who was legally His father. <a ref='Luke 2:49'>2:49</a> <b>My Father’s</b> house <b>.</b> Contrasting with Mary’s “Your father” in v. <a ref='Luke 2:48'>48</a> . His reply was in no sense insolent, but reveals a genuine amazement that they did not know where to look for Him. This also reveals that even at so young an age, He had a clear consciousness of His identity and mission. <a ref='Luke 2:51'>2:51</a> <b>continued in subjection.</b> Jesus’ relationship with His Heavenly Father did not override or nullify His duty to His earthly parents. His obedience to the fifth commandment was an essential part of the perfect legal obedience He rendered on our behalf ( <a ref='Hebrews 4:4'>Heb 4:4</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 5:8–9'>5:8–9</a> ). He had to fulfill all righteousness ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 3:15'>Mt 3:15</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 2:52'>2:52</a> <b>And Jesus was advancing.</b> Jesus did not cease being God or divest Himself of divine attributes in order to become man. Rather, He took on a human nature (an addition, not a subtraction) and in the economy of His earthly ministry He submitted as a man to the will of His Father ( <a ref='John 5:19'>Jn 5:19</a> , <a ref='John 5:30'>30</a> ; <a ref='John 8:28'>8:28</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 2:5–8'>Php 2:5–8</a> ). Therefore, there were times when His omniscience was on display ( <a ref='Matthew 9:4'>Mt 9:4</a> ; <a ref='John 2:24–25'>Jn 2:24–25</a> ; <a ref='John 4:17–18'>4:17–18</a> ; <a ref='John 11:11–14'>11:11–14</a> ; <a ref='John 16:30'>16:30</a> ) and other times when it was veiled by His humanity in accordance with the Father’s will ( <a ref='Mark 13:32'>Mk 13:32</a> ). So, in His humanity, Christ was subject to the normal process of human growth, intellectually, physically, spiritually, and socially; while at the same time remaining truly God—simple, omniscient, timeless, immutable, etc. <i>See note on <a ref='Mark 13:32'>Mk 13:32</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 3:1'>3:1</a> <b>fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius.</b> Because of the way Tiberius came to power, this date is hard to fix precisely. When the Roman Senate declared Augustus emperor ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 2:1'>2:1</a></i> ), they did so on condition that his power would end with his death, rather than passing to his heirs. The idea was that the senate, rather than the emperor himself, was to choose the heir to the throne. However, Augustus circumvented that difficulty by appointing a co-regent, on whom he planned gradually to confer the imperial powers. When he outlived his first choice for successor, Augustus next selected his son-in-law, Tiberius, whom he adopted and made his heir in AD 4 (Augustus disliked Tiberius but hoped to pass power to his grandsons through him). Tiberius was made co-regent in AD 11, then automatically became sole ruler at the death of Augustus on Aug. 19, AD 14. If Luke’s chronology is dated from Tiberius’ appointment to the co-regency, the 15th year would be AD 25 or 26. If Luke was reckoning from the death of Augustus, this date would fall between Aug. 19, AD 28 and Aug. 18, AD 29. One other fact complicates the setting of a precise date: the Jews reckoned a ruler’s term from the Jewish New Year following accession, so if Luke was using the Jewish system, the actual dates could be slightly later. The earlier date of AD 25–26 seems to fit the chronology of Christ’s life best. <b>Pontius Pilate … Herod … Philip.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 2:22'>Mt 2:22</a> .</i> <b>Lysanias.</b> Ruler of the area northwest of Damascus. History is virtually silent about him. <a ref='Luke 3:2'>3:2</a> <b>high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 4:6'>Ac 4:6</a> .</i> According to Josephus, Annas served as High Priest AD 6–15, when he was deposed by Roman officials. He nonetheless retained <i>de facto</i> power, as seen in the fact that his successors included 5 of his sons and Caiaphas, a son-in-law ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 26:3'>Mt 26:3</a></i> ). Caiaphas was the actual High Priest during the time Luke describes, but Annas still controlled the office. This is seen clearly in the fact that Christ was taken to Annas first after His arrest, then to Caiaphas ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 26:57'>Mt 26:57</a></i> ). <b>wilderness.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 3:1'>Mt 3:1</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 3:3'>3:3</a> <b>baptism of repentance.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 3:6'>Mt 3:6</a> .</i> <b>for the forgiveness of sins.</b> I.e., to symbolize and testify of the forgiveness already received upon repentance ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 2:38'>Ac 2:38</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 3:4'>3:4</a> Make His paths straight <b>.</b> Quoted from <a ref='Isaiah 40:3–5'>Is 40:3–5</a> ( <i>see notes there</i> ). A monarch traveling in wilderness regions would have a crew of workmen go ahead to make sure the road was clear of debris, obstructions, potholes, and other hazards that made the journey difficult. In a spiritual sense, John was calling the people of Israel to prepare their hearts for the coming of their Messiah. <a ref='Luke 3:6'>3:6</a> all flesh <b>.</b> I.e., Gentiles as well as Jews ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 2:31'>2:31</a></i> ). All 4 Gospels quote <a ref='Isaiah 40:3'>Is 40:3</a> ( <a ref='Matthew 3:3'>Mt 3:3</a> ; <a ref='Mark 1:3'>Mk 1:3</a> ; <a ref='John 1:23'>Jn 1:23</a> ). Only Luke adds vv. <a ref='Luke 3:5–6'>5–6</a> —thus using a familiar text from Isaiah to stress his theme of the universal scope of the gospel (see Introduction: Interpretive Challenges ). <a ref='Luke 3:7'>3:7</a> <b>the wrath to come.</b> Possibly a reference to the coming destruction of Jerusalem. But this certainly also looks beyond any earthly calamity to the eschatological outpouring of divine wrath in the day of the Lord, and especially the final judgment, where divine wrath will be the just fruit of all the unrepentant (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:18'>Ro 1:18</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 1:10'>1Th 1:10</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:27'>Heb 10:27</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 3:7'>Mt 3:7</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 3:8'>3:8</a> <b>stones.</b> Cf. <a ref='Luke 19:40'>19:40</a> . The imagery may echo OT verses such as <a ref='Ezekiel 11:19'>Eze 11:19</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 36:26'>36:26</a> ; God can sovereignly turn a heart of stone into a believing heart. He can raise up children to Abraham from inanimate objects if He chooses—or even from stony-hearted Gentiles (cf. <a ref='Galatians 3:29'>Ga 3:29</a> ). <b>children to Abraham.</b> Abraham’s true children are not merely physical descendants, but those who follow his faith, believing God’s Word the way he did ( <a ref='Romans 4:11–16'>Ro 4:11–16</a> ; <a ref='Romans 9:8'>9:8</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:7'>Ga 3:7</a> ). To trust one’s physical ancestry is to shift the focus of faith away from God Himself—and that is spiritually fatal (cf. <a ref='John 8:39–44'>Jn 8:39–44</a> ). <a ref='Luke 3:9'>3:9</a> <b>axe … at the root.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 3:10'>Mt 3:10</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 3:11'>3:11</a> <b>two tunics.</b> Shirtlike garments. Only one could be worn at a time. John was still stressing the imminence of the coming judgment. This was not a time to hoard one’s surplus goods. <a ref='Luke 3:12'>3:12</a> <b>tax collectors.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 5:46'>Mt 5:46</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 3:14'>3:14</a> <b>soldiers.</b> These were most likely members of the forces of Herod Antipas, stationed at Perea, perhaps, along with Judean police. <b>Do not take money … by force.</b> Here and in v. <a ref='Luke 3:13'>13</a> , John demanded integrity and high character in the practical matters of everyday life, not a monastic lifestyle or a mystical asceticism. Cf. <a ref='James 1:27'>Jas 1:27</a> . <a ref='Luke 3:16'>3:16</a> <b>baptize.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 3:11'>Mt 3:11</a> .</i> <b>strap of His sandals.</b> Unfastening the sandal thong was the lowliest slave’s task, preliminary to washing the feet ( <i>see note on <a ref='John 13:4–5'>Jn 13:4–5</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 3:17'>3:17</a> <b>winnowing fork.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 3:12'>Mt 3:12</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 3:19'>3:19</a> <b>reproved … because of Herodias.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 14:3'>Mt 14:3</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 3:20'>3:20</a> <b>locked John up in prison.</b> This event actually occurred much later during Jesus’ ministry ( <a ref='Matthew 14:1–12'>Mt 14:1–12</a> ; <a ref='John 3:22–24'>Jn 3:22–24</a> ). But Luke organized his material on John the Baptist topically rather than chronologically (see Introduction: Background and Setting ). <a ref='Luke 3:21'>3:21</a> <b>baptized.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 3:15'>Mt 3:15</a> .</i> <b>while He was praying.</b> Luke alone notes that Jesus was praying. Prayer is one of Luke’s themes (see Introduction: Historical and Theological Themes ). <a ref='Luke 3:22'>3:22</a> <b>Holy Spirit.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 3:16–17'>Mt 3:16–17</a> .</i> All 3 persons of the Trinity are distinguishable in this verse, a strong proof against the heresy of modalism, which suggests that God is one Person who manifests Himself in 3 distinct modes, one at a time. <b>in bodily form.</b> I.e., physical and visible to all (cf. <a ref='Matthew 3:16'>Mt 3:16</a> ; <a ref='John 1:32'>Jn 1:32</a> ). <b>like a dove.</b> A picture of gentleness ( <a ref='Matthew 10:16'>Mt 10:16</a> ). <b>My beloved Son.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 3:17'>Mt 3:17</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 3:23–38'>3:23–38</a> Luke’s genealogy moves backward, from Jesus to Adam; Matthew’s moves forward, from Abraham to Joseph. Luke’s entire section from Joseph to David differs starkly from that given by Matthew. The two genealogies are easily reconciled if Luke’s is seen as Mary’s genealogy, and Matthew’s version represents Joseph’s. Thus the royal line is passed through Jesus’ legal father, and His physical descent from David is established by Mary’s lineage. Luke, unlike Matthew ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 1:3'>Mt 1:3</a></i> ), includes no women in his genealogy—even Mary herself. Joseph was “the son of Eli” by marriage (Eli having no sons of his own), and thus is named here in v. <a ref='Luke 3:23'>23</a> as the representative of Mary’s generation. Moses himself established precedent for this sort of substitution in <a ref='Numbers 27:1–11'>Nu 27:1–11</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 36:1–12'>36:1–12</a> . The men listed from Eli (v. <a ref='Luke 3:23'>23</a> ) to Rhesa (v. <a ref='Luke 3:27'>27</a> ) are found nowhere else in Scripture. Zerubbabel and Shealtiel (v. <a ref='Luke 3:27'>27</a> ) are the only two names here that correspond to names in Matthew’s genealogy between David and Jesus. For an explanation <i>see notes on <a ref='Haggai 2:23'>Hag 2:23</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 1:12'>Mt 1:12</a></i> . <a ref='Luke 3:23'>3:23</a> <b>about thirty years of age.</b> Luke was probably not fixing an exact age. Rather, this was an approximation, 30 being a customary age for entering into the office of prophet ( <a ref='Ezekiel 1:1'>Eze 1:1</a> ); priest ( <a ref='Numbers 4:3'>Nu 4:3</a> , <a ref='Numbers 4:35'>35</a> , <a ref='Numbers 4:39'>39</a> , <a ref='Numbers 4:43'>43</a> , <a ref='Numbers 4:47'>47</a> ), or king ( <a ref='Genesis 41:46'>Ge 41:46</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 5:4'>2Sa 5:4</a> ). <b>as was supposed.</b> Luke had already established the fact of the virgin birth ( <a ref='Luke 1:34–35'>1:34–35</a> ); here he made clear once again that Joseph was not Jesus’ true father. <a ref='Luke 4:1'>4:1</a> <b>led … by the Spirit.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 4:1'>Mt 4:1</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 4:2'>4:2</a> <b>forty days … tempted.</b> Evidently, the temptation of Christ encompassed the full 40 days of His fast ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 4:2'>Mt 4:2</a></i> ). Both Matthew and Luke give a condensed recounting of only 3 specific temptations. Luke reverses the order of the last two temptations in Matthew’s account. Luke occasionally ordered material logically, rather than chronologically (see Introduction: Background and Setting ; <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 1:3'>1:3</a></i> ). Luke may have had some purpose for doing so here—perhaps to end his account of Jesus’ temptation at the temple in Jerusalem (cf. v. <a ref='Luke 4:9'>9</a> ), a very important location in Luke’s narrative (see Introduction: Historical and Theological Themes ). <a ref='Luke 4:3–13'>4:3–13</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 4:3–10'>Mt 4:3–10</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 4:4'>4:4</a> Jesus quoted <a ref='Deuteronomy 8:3'>Dt 8:3</a> . <a ref='Luke 4:8'>4:8</a> Jesus quoted <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:13'>Dt 6:13</a> . <a ref='Luke 4:10–11'>4:10–11</a> Satan quoted <a ref='Psalms 91:11–12'>Ps 91:11–12</a> . <a ref='Luke 4:12'>4:12</a> Jesus quoted <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:16'>Dt 6:16</a> . <a ref='Luke 4:13'>4:13</a> <b>until an opportune time.</b> Satan’s temptations did not end here for Christ, but persisted throughout His ministry (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 4:15'>Heb 4:15</a> ), and culminated in Gethsemane ( <a ref='Luke 22:39–46'>22:39–46</a> ). <a ref='Luke 4:14'>4:14</a> <b>returned to Galilee.</b> The synoptic Gospels are largely silent about Jesus’ ministry between His baptism and His return to Galilee, but John recorded a fairly extensive ministry in Jerusalem and Judea ( <a ref='John 2:12–4:1'>Jn 2:12—4:1</a> ). Because of this, news of Him quickly spread. <a ref='Luke 4:15'>4:15</a> <b>synagogues.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Mark 1:21'>Mk 1:21</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 4:16'>4:16</a> <b>He came to Nazareth.</b> Luke acknowledged in v. <a ref='Luke 4:23'>23</a> ( <i>see note there</i> ) that Christ had already ministered in Capernaum. Yet Luke purposely situated this episode at the beginning of his account of Christ’s public ministry. Here is an example of Luke’s ordering things logically rather than chronologically (see Introduction: Background and Setting ; see note on <a ref='Luke 1:3'>1:3</a> ). <b>as was His custom.</b> Nazareth was His hometown, so He would have been well known to all who regularly attended this synagogue. <a ref='Luke 4:18'>4:18</a> He anointed Me <b>.</b> I.e., the Spirit Himself was the anointing (vv. <a ref='Luke 4:1'>1</a> , <a ref='Luke 4:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Luke 4:19'>4:19</a> the favorable year of the Lord <b>.</b> Or, “the year of the Lord’s favor.” The passage Christ read was <a ref='Isaiah 61:1–2'>Is 61:1–2</a> . He stopped in the middle of v. <a ref='Luke 4:2'>2</a> . The rest of the verse prophesies judgment in the day of God’s vengeance. Since that part of the verse pertains to the second advent, He did not read it. <a ref='Luke 4:20'>4:20</a> <b>sat down.</b> It was customary for a teacher to stand respectfully during the reading of the Scriptures (v. <a ref='Luke 4:16'>16</a> ), and sit humbly to teach. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 5:1'>Mt 5:1</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 4:21'>4:21</a> <b>this Scripture has been fulfilled.</b> This was an unambiguous claim that He was the Messiah who fulfilled the prophecy. They correctly understood His meaning but could not accept such lofty claims from One whom they knew so well as the carpenter’s son (v. <a ref='Luke 4:22'>22</a> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 13:55'>Mt 13:55</a> ). <a ref='Luke 4:23'>4:23</a> <b>Capernaum.</b> Obviously, Christ had already gained a reputation for His miraculous works in Capernaum. Scripture gives few details about that first year of public ministry. Most of what we know about those months is found in John’s Gospel, and it suggests Christ ministered mostly in Judea. However, <a ref='John 2:12'>Jn 2:12</a> mentions a brief visit to Capernaum, with no other details. <a ref='John 4:46–54'>John 4:46–54</a> describes how while Christ was at Cana, He healed a royal official’s son who lay sick in Capernaum. We also know that Christ had already gathered some of His disciples, who were men from the north shore of the Sea of Galilee ( <a ref='John 1:35–42'>Jn 1:35–42</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 4:18'>Mt 4:18</a></i> ). He might have visited there more than once during that first year of ministry. In any case, He had been there long enough to do miracles, and His fame had spread throughout Galilee (cf. v. <a ref='Luke 4:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Luke 4:25–27'>4:25–27</a> Both the widow of Zarephath ( <a ref='1 Kings 17:8–24'>1Ki 17:8–24</a> ) and Naaman the Syrian ( <a ref='2Ki 5'>2Ki 5</a> ) were Gentiles. Both lived during times of widespread unbelief in Israel. Jesus’ point was that God bypassed all the widows and lepers in Israel, yet showed grace to two Gentiles. God’s concern for Gentiles and outcasts is one of the thematic threads that runs through Luke’s Gospel (see Introduction: Historical and Theological Themes ). <a ref='Luke 4:28'>4:28</a> <b>filled with rage.</b> This is Luke’s first mention of hostile opposition to Christ’s ministry.

The fact that these Pharisees raised this question shows that they thought of fasting as a public exercise to display one’s own spirituality.

In stark contrast to all other so-called healers, Christ was not selective. He healed all who came to Him (v. <a ref='Luke 6:19'>19</a> ; cf. <a ref='Luke 4:40'>4:40</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 8:16'>Mt 8:16</a> ). <a ref='Luke 6:8'>6:8</a> <b>knew what they were thinking.</b> Cf. <a ref='Luke 5:22'>5:22</a> . <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 9:4'>Mt 9:4</a> .</i> <b>come forward.</b> Jesus purposely did this miracle openly, before all, as if to demonstrate His contempt for the Pharisees’ man-made regulations. <a ref='Luke 6:9'>6:9</a> <b>to do good.</b> The Sabbath laws forbade labor for profit, frivolous diversions, and things extraneous to worship. Activity per se was not unlawful. Good works were especially appropriate on the Sabbath—particularly deeds of charity, mercy, and worship. Works necessary for the preservation of life were also permitted. To corrupt the Sabbath to forbid such works was a perversion of God’s design. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 12:2–3'>Mt 12:2–3</a> .</i> <b>to do harm.</b> Refusal to do good is tantamount to doing evil ( <a ref='James 4:17'>Jas 4:17</a> ). <a ref='Luke 6:10'>6:10</a> <b>looking around at them.</b> I.e., giving them a chance to respond to the question of v. <a ref='Luke 6:9'>9</a> .

They were unable to answer His reasoning (vv. <a ref='Luke 6:9–10'>9–10</a> ). And furthermore, by healing the man only with a command, He had performed no actual “work” that they could charge Him with. Desperately seeking a reason to accuse Him (v. <a ref='Luke 6:7'>7</a> ), they could find none.

At one point He sent 70 out in pairs to proclaim the gospel ( <a ref='Luke 10:1'>10:1</a> ). But on this occasion, He chose 12 and specifically commissioned them as apostles, i.e., “sent ones,” with a special authority to deliver His message on His behalf (cf. <a ref='Acts 1:21–22'>Ac 1:21–22</a> ). The Twelve Apostles <a ref='Matthew 10:2–4'>Matthew 10:2–4</a> <a ref='Mark 3:16–19'>Mark 3:16–19</a> <a ref='Luke 6:14–16'>Luke 6:14–16</a> <a ref='Acts 1:13'>Acts 1:13</a> Simon Peter Andrew James John Philip Bartholomew Thomas Matthew James (of Alphaeus) Thaddaeus Simon (the Canaanite) Judas Iscariot Simon Peter James John Andrew Philip Bartholomew Matthew Thomas James (of Alphaeus) Thaddaeus Simon (the Canaanite) Judas Iscariot Simon Peter Andrew James John Philip Bartholomew Matthew Thomas James (of Alphaeus) Simon (the Zealot) Judas (of James) Judas Iscariot Simon Peter John James Andrew Philip Thomas Bartholomew Matthew James (of Alphaeus) Simon (the Zealot) Judas (of James) Matthew and Mark have the name Thaddaeus while Luke, in his two lists ( <a ref='Lu 6'>Luke 6</a> and <a ref='Ac 1'>Acts 1</a> ), has Judas (of James). Some think Judas may have been his original name and that it was changed later to Thaddaeus in order to avoid the stigma attached to the name of Judas Iscariot. “The Canaanite” is a transliteration that probably represents an Aramaic word meaning “Zealous.” Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Luke 6:17–49'>6:17–49</a> The Sermon on the Plateau. The similarity to the Sermon on the Mount ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 5:1–7:29'>Mt 5:1—7:29</a></i> ) is remarkable. It is possible, of course, that Jesus simply preached the same sermon on more than one occasion. (It is evident that He often used the same material more than once—e.g., <a ref='Luke 12:58–59'>12:58–59</a> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:25–26'>Mt 5:25–26</a> .) It appears more likely, however, that these are variant accounts of the same event. Luke’s version is abbreviated somewhat, because he omitted sections from the sermon that are uniquely Jewish (particularly Christ’s exposition of the law). Aside from that, the two sermons follow exactly the same flow of thought, beginning with the Beatitudes and ending with the parable about building on the rock. Differences in wording between the two accounts are undoubtedly owing to the fact that the sermon was originally delivered in Aramaic. Luke and Matthew translate into Greek with slight variances. Of course, both translations are equally inspired and authoritative. <a ref='Luke 6:17'>6:17</a> <b>a level place.</b> Elsewhere it says “on the mountain” ( <a ref='Matthew 5:1'>Mt 5:1</a> ). These harmonize easily if Luke is referring to either a plateau or a level place on the mountainside. Indeed, there is such a place at the site near Capernaum where tradition says this sermon was delivered. <b>Tyre and Sidon.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 11:21'>Mt 11:21</a> ; <a ref='Mark 3:8'>Mk 3:8</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 6:18'>6:18</a> <b>unclean spirits.</b> Another name for demons, used 10 times in the Gospels. <a ref='Luke 6:19'>6:19</a> <b>power was coming from Him.</b> Cf. <a ref='Luke 8:45–46'>8:45–46</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Mark 5:30'>Mk 5:30</a></i> . <a ref='Luke 6:20–25'>6:20–25</a> Luke’s account of the Beatitudes is abbreviated (cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:3–12'>Mt 5:3–12</a> ). He lists only 4, and balances them with 4 parallel woes. <a ref='Luke 6:20'>6:20</a> <b>the poor.</b> Christ’s concern for the poor and outcasts is one of Luke’s favorite themes (see Introduction: Historical and Theological Themes ). Luke used a personal pronoun (“you”) where <a ref='Matthew 5:3'>Mt 5:3</a> employed a definite article (“the”); Luke was underscoring the tender, personal sense of Christ’s words. A comparison of the two passages reveals that Christ was dealing with something more significant than mere material poverty and wealth, however. The poverty spoken of here refers primarily to a sense of one’s own spiritual impoverishment. <a ref='Luke 6:21'>6:21</a> <b>those who hunger.</b> No mere craving for food, but a hunger and thirst for righteousness ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 5:6'>Mt 5:6</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 6:22'>6:22</a> <b>for the sake of the Son of Man.</b> Persecution per se is not something to be sought. But when evil is spoken against a Christian falsely and for Christ’s sake ( <a ref='Matthew 5:11'>Mt 5:11</a> ), such persecution carries with it the blessing of God. <a ref='Luke 6:29'>6:29</a> <b>offer … the other also.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 5:39'>Mt 5:39</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 6:31'>6:31</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 7:12'>Mt 7:12</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 6:35'>6:35</a> <b>sons of the Most High.</b> I.e., God’s children should bear the indelible stamp of His moral character.

It is a measure of the respect this man had in the community that Jewish elders would be willing to bring his cause to Jesus. He loved the Jewish nation and was somehow personally responsible for the building of the local synagogue (v. <a ref='Luke 7:5'>5</a> ). He obviously was being drawn to Christ by God Himself (cf. <a ref='John 6:44'>Jn 6:44</a> , <a ref='John 6:65'>65</a> ). Like all men under conviction, he deeply sensed his own unworthiness ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 5:8'>5:8</a></i> ), and that is why he used intermediaries rather than speaking to Jesus personally (vv. <a ref='Luke 7:6–7'>6–7</a> ). <a ref='Luke 7:6'>7:6</a> <b>not good enough.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 8:8'>Mt 8:8</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 7:11'>7:11</a> <b>Nain.</b> A small town southeast of Nazareth. <a ref='Luke 7:12'>7:12</a> <b>only son.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 9:38'>9:38</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 7:14'>7:14</a> <b>touched the coffin.</b> A ceremonially defiling act, normally.

We are not to think that his faith was failing or that he had lost confidence in Christ. But with so many unexpected turns of events—John in prison, Christ encountering unbelief and hostility—John wanted reassurance from Christ Himself. That is precisely what Jesus gave him (vv. <a ref='Luke 7:22–23'>22–23</a> ). <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 11:3–11'>Mt 11:3–11</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 7:22'>7:22</a> <b>Go and report to John.</b> Verses <a ref='Luke 7:22–23'>22–23</a> are quoted from <a ref='Isaiah 35:5–6'>Is 35:5–6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 61:1'>61:1</a> .

By refusing repentance, they rejected not just John the Baptist, but also God Himself. <a ref='Luke 7:32'>7:32</a> <b>like children.</b> Christ used strong derision to rebuke the Pharisees. He suggested they were behaving childishly, determined not to be pleased, whether invited to “dance” (a reference to Christ’s joyous style of ministry, “eating and drinking” with sinners—v. <a ref='Luke 7:34'>34</a> ), or urged to “cry” (a reference to John the Baptist’s call to repentance, and John’s more austere manner of ministry—v. <a ref='Luke 7:33'>33</a> ). <a ref='Luke 7:34'>7:34</a> <b>eating and drinking.</b> I.e., living an ordinary life. This passage explains why John’s style of ministry differed so dramatically from Jesus’ approach, although their message was the same ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 4:17'>Mt 4:17</a></i> ). The different methods took away all the Pharisees’ excuses. The very thing they had professed to want to see in Jesus—rigid abstinence and a Spartan lifestyle—was what characterized the ministry of John the Baptist, yet they had already rejected him, too. The real problem lay in the corruption of their own hearts, but they would not acknowledge that. <b>friend of … sinners.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Luke 5:30–33'>5:30–33</a> ; <a ref='Luke 15:2'>15:2</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 7:35'>7:35</a> <b>wisdom is vindicated by all her children.</b> I.e., true wisdom is vindicated by its consequences—what it produces. Cf. <a ref='James 2:14–17'>Jas 2:14–17</a> . <a ref='Luke 7:36'>7:36</a> <b>one of the Pharisees.</b> His name was Simon (v. <a ref='Luke 7:40'>40</a> ). He does not appear to have been sympathetic to Jesus (cf. vv. <a ref='Luke 7:44–46'>44–46</a> ). Undoubtedly, his motive was either to entrap Jesus, or to find some reason to accuse Him (cf. <a ref='Luke 6:7'>6:7</a> ). <a ref='Luke 7:37'>7:37</a> <b>an alabaster jar.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 26:7'>Mt 26:7</a> .</i> This is similar in many ways to the events described in <a ref='Matthew 26:6–13'>Mt 26:6–13</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:3–9'>Mk 14:3–9</a> ; <a ref='John 12:2–8'>Jn 12:2–8</a> , but it is clearly a different incident. That took place in Bethany, near Jerusalem, during the Passion Week. In the anointing at Bethany it was Mary, sister of Martha and Lazarus, who anointed Jesus. This incident takes place in Galilee and involves “a woman … who was a sinner”—i.e., a prostitute. There is no reason to identify this woman with Mary Magdalene, as some have done ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 8:2'>8:2</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 7:38'>7:38</a> <b>standing behind</b> Him <b>at His feet.</b> He was reclining at a low table, as was the custom. It would have been shocking to all for a woman of such low reputation to come to a Pharisee’s house. Such dinners involving dignitaries were often open to spectators—but no one would have expected a prostitute to attend. Her coming took great courage, and reveals the desperation with which she sought forgiveness. Her “weeping” was an expression of deep repentance. <a ref='Luke 7:39'>7:39</a> <b>what sort of … woman.</b> The Pharisees showed nothing but contempt for sinners. Simon was convinced that if Jesus knew her character, He would have sent her away, for her touching Him was presumed to convey ceremonial uncleanness. <i>See notes on v. <a ref='Luke 7:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Luke 8:44'>8:44</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 7:40'>7:40</a> <b>Jesus answered.</b> Jesus knew Simon’s thoughts (cf. <a ref='Luke 5:22'>5:22</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 9:4'>Mt 9:4</a></i> )—demonstrating to Simon that He was indeed a Prophet. <a ref='Luke 7:41'>7:41</a> <b>denarii.</b> Each denarius was worth a day’s labor ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 22:19'>Mt 22:19</a></i> ), so this was a large sum—about two years’ full wages. <a ref='Luke 7:44'>7:44</a> <b>no water for My feet.</b> A glaring oversight. Washing a guest’s feet was an essential formality ( <i>see note on <a ref='John 13:4–5'>Jn 13:4–5</a></i> ). Not to offer a guest water for the washing of feet was tantamount to an insult—as it would be in modern Western culture if one did not offer to take a guest’s coat. <a ref='Luke 7:47'>7:47</a> <b>for she loved much.</b> This is not to suggest that she was forgiven because she loved much. The parable (vv. <a ref='Luke 7:41–43'>41–43</a> ) pictured a forgiveness that was unconditional, and love was the result. Therefore to make the woman’s love the reason for her forgiveness would be to distort the lesson Jesus is teaching here. “For” here has the sense of “wherefore.” And her faith (v. <a ref='Luke 7:50'>50</a> ), not the act of anointing Jesus’ feet, was the instrument by which she laid hold of His forgiveness. <a ref='Luke 7:49'>7:49</a> <b>forgives sins.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Luke 5:20–21'>5:20–21</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 9:1–3'>Mt 9:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Mark 2:7'>Mk 2:7</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 7:50'>7:50</a> <b>Your faith has saved you.</b> Not all whom Jesus healed were saved, but those who exhibited true faith were (cf. <a ref='Luke 17:19'>17:19</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:42'>18:42</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 9:22'>Mt 9:22</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Mark 5:34'>Mk 5:34</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 8:2'>8:2</a> <b>some women.</b> Rabbis normally did not have women as disciples. <b>Mary … called Magdalene.</b> Her name probably derives from the Galilean town of Magdala.

The brightness of this cloud and the sleepiness of the disciples (v. <a ref='Luke 9:32'>32</a> ) suggest that this event may have occurred at night. <a ref='Luke 9:35'>9:35</a> <b>This is My Son.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 3:17'>Mt 3:17</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 9:38'>9:38</a> <b>my only</b> one <b>.</b> Cf. <a ref='Luke 7:12'>7:12</a> ; <a ref='Luke 8:42'>8:42</a> .

John came to see that only legitimate tests of another person’s ministry are the test of doctrine ( <a ref='1 John 4:1–3'>1Jn 4:1–3</a> ; <a ref='2 John 1:7–11'>2Jn 7–11</a> ) and the test of fruit ( <a ref='1 John 2:4–6'>1Jn 2:4–6</a> , <a ref='1 John 2:29'>29</a> ; <a ref='1 John 3:4–12'>3:4–12</a> ; <a ref='1 John 4:5'>4:5</a> , <a ref='1 John 4:20'>20</a> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 7:16'>Mt 7:16</a> ). This man would have passed both tests, but John was inclined to reject him because of his group affiliation. That is the error of sectarianism. <a ref='Luke 9:50'>9:50</a> <b>he who is not against you is for you.</b> Contrast this with <a ref='Luke 11:23'>11:23</a> . There is no middle ground and no neutrality. Here Christ gave a test of outward conduct to use for measuring others. In <a ref='Luke 11:23'>11:23</a> , He gave a test of the inward life that is to be applied to oneself. <a ref='Luke 9:51'>9:51</a> <b>set His face to go to Jerusalem.</b> This begins a major section of Luke’s Gospel. From here to <a ref='Luke 19:27'>19:27</a> , Christ’s face was set toward Jerusalem ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 9:53'>53</a></i> ), and Luke’s narrative is a travelogue of that long journey to the cross. This was a dramatic turning point in Christ’s ministry. After this, Galilee was no longer His base of operation. Although <a ref='Luke 17:11–37'>17:11–37</a> describes a return visit to Galilee, Luke included everything between this point and that short Galilean sojourn as part of the journey to Jerusalem. We know from a comparison of the Gospels that, during this period of Christ’s ministry, He made short visits to Jerusalem to celebrate feasts ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Luke 13:22'>13:22</a> ; <a ref='Luke 17:11'>17:11</a></i> ). Nonetheless, those brief visits were only interludes in this period of ministry that would culminate in a final journey to Jerusalem for the purpose of dying there. Thus Luke underscored this turning point in Christ’s ministry more dramatically than any of the other Gospels, by showing Christ’s determination to complete His mission of going to the cross. <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 12:50'>12:50</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 9:52'>9:52</a> <b>Samaritans.</b> These people were descendants of Jewish mixed marriages from the days of captivity. They were rivals of the Jewish nation and had devised their own worship, a hybrid of Judaism and paganism, with a temple of their own on Mt. Gerizim. They were considered unclean by the Jews and were so hated that most Jewish travelers from Galilee to Judah took the longer route east of the Jordan to avoid traveling through Samaria. <i>See note on <a ref='John 4:4'>Jn 4:4</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 9:53'>9:53</a> <b>because He was journeying with His face toward Jerusalem.</b> Traveling to Jerusalem for worship implied rejection of the rituals on Mt. Gerizim and a contempt for Samaritan worship ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 9:52'>52</a></i> ). This was a strong point of contention between Jews and Samaritans (cf. <a ref='John 4:20–22'>Jn 4:20–22</a> ). <a ref='Luke 9:54'>9:54</a> <b>James and John.</b> Jesus nicknamed these brothers “Boanerges”—Sons of Thunder ( <a ref='Mark 3:17'>Mk 3:17</a> )—a fitting title, apparently. This was John’s second sin against charity in such a short time ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 9:49'>49</a></i> ). It is interesting to note that several years later, the apostle John journeyed through Samaria once again with Peter, this time preaching the gospel in Samaritan villages ( <a ref='Acts 8:25'>Ac 8:25</a> ). <a ref='Luke 9:55'>9:55</a> <b>rebuked them.</b> Christ’s response to the Samaritans exemplifies the attitude the church ought to have with regard to all forms of religious persecution. The Samaritans’ worship was pagan at heart, plainly wrong ( <i>see note on <a ref='John 4:22'>Jn 4:22</a></i> ). Compounding that was their intolerance. Yet, the Lord would not retaliate with force against them. Nor did He even revile them verbally. He had come to save, not to destroy, and so His response was grace rather than destructive fury. Nonetheless, Christ’s words of disapproval here must not be taken as condemnation of Elijah’s actions in <a ref='1 Kings 18:38–40'>1Ki 18:38–40</a> or <a ref='2 Kings 1:10–12'>2Ki 1:10–12</a> . Elijah was commissioned to a special ministry as prophet in a theocracy, and it was his God-ordained task to confront an evil monarch (Ahab) who was attempting to usurp God’s authority. Elijah was specifically authorized to measure out the reprisal of God’s wrath. Elijah acted with an authority comparable to that of modern civil authorities (cf. <a ref='Romans 13:4'>Ro 13:4</a> )—not in a capacity that parallels that of ministers of the gospel. <a ref='Luke 9:59–60'>9:59–60</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 8:21–22'>Mt 8:21–22</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 9:62'>9:62</a> <b>looking back.</b> A plowman looking back cuts a crooked furrow. <a ref='Luke 10:1'>10:1</a> <b>seventy others.</b> The commissioning of the 70 is recorded only in Luke. Moses also appointed 70 elders as his representatives ( <a ref='Numbers 11:16'>Nu 11:16</a> , <a ref='Numbers 11:24–25'>24–25</a> ). The 12 disciples had been sent into Galilee ( <a ref='Luke 9:1–6'>9:1–6</a> ); the 70 were sent into every city and place where He was about to go—i.e., into Judea, and possibly Perea ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 19:1'>Mt 19:1</a></i> ). <b>in pairs.</b> As the 12 had been sent ( <a ref='Mark 6:7'>Mk 6:7</a> ; cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 4:9'>Ecc 4:9</a> , <a ref='Ecclesiastes 4:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='Acts 13:2'>Ac 13:2</a> ; <a ref='Acts 15:27'>15:27</a> , <a ref='Acts 15:39–40'>39–40</a> ; <a ref='Acts 19:22'>19:22</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:3'>Rev 11:3</a> ). <a ref='Luke 10:3'>10:3</a> <b>lambs in the midst of wolves.</b> I.e., they would face hostility (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 2:3–6'>Eze 2:3–6</a> ; <a ref='John 15:20'>Jn 15:20</a> ) and spiritual danger (cf. <a ref='Matthew 7:15'>Mt 7:15</a> ; <a ref='John 10:12'>Jn 10:12</a> ). <a ref='Luke 10:4'>10:4</a> <b>no money belt, no bag, no sandals.</b> I.e., travel without luggage. This does not mean they would be barefoot. <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 9:3'>9:3</a> .</i> <b>greet no one.</b> A greeting in that culture was an elaborate ceremony, involving many formalities, perhaps even a meal, and long delays ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 11:43'>11:43</a></i> ). A person on an extremely urgent mission could be excused from such formalities without being thought rude. Everything in Jesus’ instructions speaks of the shortness of time and the great urgency of the task. <a ref='Luke 10:7'>10:7</a> <b>Do not keep moving from house to house.</b> I.e., for lodging ( <i>see note on <a ref='Mark 6:10'>Mk 6:10</a></i> ).

The 70 probably did not return all at once, but this dialogue appears to have occurred after they had all reassembled. <a ref='Luke 10:18'>10:18</a> <b>I was watching Satan fall.</b> In this context, it appears Jesus’ meaning was, “Don’t be so surprised that the demons are subject to you; I saw their commander cast out of heaven, so it is no wonder if his minions are cast out on earth. After all, I am the source of the authority that makes them subject to you” (v. <a ref='Luke 10:19'>19</a> ). He may also have intended a subtle reminder and warning against pride—the reason for Satan’s fall (cf. <a ref='1 Timothy 3:6'>1Ti 3:6</a> ). For discussions of Satan’s fall, <i>see notes on <a ref='Isaiah 14:12–14'>Is 14:12–14</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 28:12–15'>Eze 28:12–15</a></i> . <a ref='Luke 10:19'>10:19</a> <b>serpents and scorpions.</b> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 91:13'>Ps 91:13</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 2:6'>Eze 2:6</a> .

By contrast, unbelievers are “written down because they have forsaken … Yahweh” ( <a ref='Jeremiah 17:13'>Jer 17:13</a> ). <a ref='Luke 10:21–22'>10:21–22</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 11:25–26'>Mt 11:25–26</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 10:25'>10:25</a> <b>scholar of the Law.</b> I.e., a scribe who was supposedly an expert in the law of God. Aside from one usage of this word in <a ref='Matthew 22:35'>Mt 22:35</a> ( <i>see note there</i> ), Luke is the only one of the Gospel writers who uses it ( <a ref='Luke 11:45–46'>11:45–46</a> ). <b>what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</b> The same question is raised by several inquirers ( <a ref='Luke 18:18–23'>18:18–23</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 19:16–22'>Mt 19:16–22</a> ; <a ref='John 3:1–15'>Jn 3:1–15</a> ). <a ref='Luke 10:27'>10:27</a> <b>he answered.</b> The lawyer summed up the requirements of the law ( <a ref='Leviticus 19:18'>Lv 19:18</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:5'>Dt 6:5</a> ) exactly as Christ did on another occasion ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 22:37–40'>Mt 22:37–40</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 10:28'>10:28</a> do this and you will live <b>.</b> Cf. <a ref='Leviticus 18:5'>Lv 18:5</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 20:11'>Eze 20:11</a> . “Do and live” is the promise of the law. But since no sinner can obey perfectly, the impossible demands of the law are meant to drive us to seek divine mercy ( <a ref='Galatians 3:10–13'>Ga 3:10–13</a> , <a ref='Galatians 3:22–25'>22–25</a> ). This man should have responded with a confession of his own guilt, rather than self-justification (v. <a ref='Luke 10:29'>29</a> ). <a ref='Luke 10:29'>10:29</a> <b>wishing to justify himself.</b> This reveals the man’s self-righteous character. <b>who is my neighbor?</b> The prevailing opinion among scribes and Pharisees was that one’s neighbors were the righteous alone. According to them, the wicked—including rank sinners (such as tax collectors and prostitutes), Gentiles, and especially Samaritans—were to be hated because they were the enemies of God. They cited <a ref='Psalms 139:21–22'>Ps 139:21–22</a> to justify their position. As that passage suggests, hatred of evil is the natural corollary of loving righteousness. But the truly righteous person’s “hatred” for sinners is not a malevolent enmity. It is a righteous abhorrence of all that is base and corrupt—not a spiteful, personal loathing of individuals. Godly hatred is marked by a broken-hearted grieving over the condition of the sinner. And as Jesus taught here and elsewhere ( <a ref='Luke 6:27–36'>6:27–36</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 5:44–48'>Mt 5:44–48</a> ), it is also tempered by a genuine love. The Pharisees had elevated hostility toward the wicked to the status of a virtue, in effect nullifying the second Great Commandment. Jesus’ answer to this lawyer demolished the pharisaical excuse for hating one’s enemies. <a ref='Luke 10:30'>10:30</a> <b>down from Jerusalem to Jericho.</b> A rocky, winding, treacherous descent of about 3,300 feet in 17 miles. That stretch of road was notorious for being beset with thieves and danger. <a ref='Luke 10:32'>10:32</a> <b>Levite.</b> These were from the tribe of Levi, but not descendants of Aaron. They assisted the priests in the work of the temple. <a ref='Luke 10:33'>10:33</a> <b>Samaritan.</b> For a Samaritan to travel this road was unusual. The Samaritan himself was risking not only the thieves, but also the hostility of other travelers. <a ref='Luke 10:34'>10:34</a> <b>oil and wine.</b> Probably carried by most travelers in small amounts as a kind of first-aid kit. The wine was antiseptic; the oil soothing and healing. <a ref='Luke 10:35'>10:35</a> <b>two denarii.</b> I.e., two days’ wages ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 20:2'>Mt 20:2</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 22:19'>22:19</a></i> ). Probably more than enough to permit the man to stay until he recovered. <a ref='Luke 10:36'>10:36</a> <b>neighbor to the man.</b> Jesus reversed the lawyer’s original question (v. <a ref='Luke 10:29'>29</a> ). The lawyer assumed it was up to others to prove themselves neighbor to him ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 10:29'>29</a></i> ). Jesus’ reply makes it clear that each has a responsibility to be a neighbor—especially to those who are in need. <a ref='Luke 10:38'>10:38</a> <b>a village.</b> Bethany, two mi. east of the temple in Jerusalem, on the east slope of the Mt. of Olives. This was the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus (cf. <a ref='John 11:1'>Jn 11:1</a> ). <a ref='Luke 10:40'>10:40</a> <b>distracted.</b> Lit. “dragging all around.” The expression implies that Martha was in a tumult. <b>with all her preparations.</b> Martha was evidently fussing about with details that were unnecessarily elaborate. <a ref='Luke 10:42'>10:42</a> <b>one thing … good part.</b> Jesus was not speaking of the number of dishes to be served. The one thing necessary was exemplified by Mary, i.e., an attitude of worship and meditation, listening with an open mind and heart to Jesus’ words. <a ref='Luke 11:1'>11:1</a> <b>Lord, teach us to pray.</b> Rabbis often composed prayers for their disciples to recite. Having seen Jesus pray many times, they knew of His love for prayer, and they knew prayer was not just the reciting of words ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 6:7'>Mt 6:7</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 11:2'>11:2</a> <b>Father.</b> Virtually the same prayer was given as a model on two separate occasions by Christ, first in the Sermon on the Mount ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 6:9–13'>Mt 6:9–13</a></i> ), and then here, in response to a direct question. That accounts for minor variations between the two versions. <b>Your name.</b> God’s name represents all His character and attributes.

And, in fact, the evidence in <a ref='Ac 19'>Ac 19</a> suggests that the sons of Sceva were charlatans who employed fraud and trickery to fabricate phony exorcisms. <b>your judges.</b> I.e., witnesses against you.

The exact same expression is used in v. <a ref='Luke 12:22'>22</a> , speaking of concern for one’s material necessities. In neither context was Jesus condemning legitimate toil and preparation.

In any case, Jesus seemed unconcerned about the implied injustice, and refused the man’s request to arbitrate the family dispute. <a ref='Luke 12:14'>12:14</a> <b>who appointed Me a judge…?</b> One of Christ’s roles is that of Judge of all the earth ( <a ref='John 5:22'>Jn 5:22</a> ), but He did not come to be an arbiter of petty earthly disputes.

Evidently, some worshipers from Galilee were condemned by Rome—perhaps because they were seditious zealots ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 10:4'>Mt 10:4</a></i> )—and were sought out and killed in the temple by Roman authorities while in the process of offering a sacrifice. Such a killing would have been the grossest sort of blasphemy. Incidents like this inflamed the Jews’ hatred of Rome and finally led to rebellion, and the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70. <a ref='Luke 13:2'>13:2</a> greater <b>sinners.</b> It was the belief of many that disaster and sudden death always signified divine displeasure over particular sins (cf. <a ref='Job 4:7'>Job 4:7</a> ). Those who suffered in uncommon ways were therefore assumed to be guilty of some more severe immorality (cf. <a ref='John 9:2'>Jn 9:2</a> ). <a ref='Luke 13:3'>13:3</a> <b>unless you repent.</b> Jesus did not deny the connection between catastrophe and human evil, for all such afflictions ultimately stem from the curse of humanity’s fallenness ( <a ref='Genesis 3:17–19'>Ge 3:17–19</a> ). Furthermore, specific calamities may indeed be the fruit of certain iniquities ( <a ref='Proverbs 24:16'>Pr 24:16</a> ). But Christ challenged the people’s notion that they were morally superior to those who suffered in such catastrophes. He called all to repent, for all were in danger of sudden destruction. No one is guaranteed time to prepare for death, so now is the time for repentance for all (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:2'>2Co 6:2</a> ). <b>you will all likewise perish.</b> These words prophetically warned of the approaching judgment of Israel, which culminated in the catastrophic destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70. Thousands in Jerusalem were killed by the Romans. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 23:36'>Mt 23:36</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 13:4'>13:4</a> <b>Siloam.</b> An area at the south end of the lower city of Jerusalem, where there was a well-known pool (cf. <a ref='John 9:7'>Jn 9:7</a> , <a ref='John 9:11'>11</a> ). Evidently, one of the towers guarding the aqueduct collapsed, perhaps while under construction, killing some people. Again, the question in the minds of people was regarding the connection between calamity and iniquity (“ <i>worse</i> culprits”). Jesus responded by saying that such a calamity was not God’s way to single out an especially evil group for death, but as a means of warning to all sinners. Calamitous judgment was eventually coming to all if they did not repent. <a ref='Luke 13:6'>13:6</a> <b>fig tree.</b> Often used as a symbol for Israel ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 21:19'>Mt 21:19</a> ; <a ref='Mark 11:14'>Mk 11:14</a></i> ).

However, Christ did not have to confront and drive out a demon, but simply declared her loosed (v. <a ref='Luke 13:12'>12</a> ), so her case appears somewhat different from other cases of demonic possession He often encountered (cf. <a ref='Luke 11:14'>11:14</a> ; <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 13:16'>16</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 13:12'>13:12</a> <b>He called her over.</b> The healing was unsolicited; He took the initiative (cf. <a ref='Luke 7:12–14'>7:12–14</a> ). Furthermore, no special faith was required on her part or anyone else’s. Jesus sometimes called for faith, but not always (cf. <a ref='Luke 8:48'>8:48</a> ; <a ref='Mark 5:34'>Mk 5:34</a> ). <a ref='Luke 13:14'>13:14</a> <b>official.</b> An eminent layman whose responsibilities included conducting meetings, caring for the building, and supervising the teaching in the synagogue (cf. <a ref='Luke 8:41'>8:41</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 9:18'>Mt 9:18</a> ; <a ref='Mark 5:38'>Mk 5:38</a> ). <a ref='Luke 13:15'>13:15</a> <b>release his ox.</b> Nothing in Scripture forbade either the watering of an ox or the healing of the sick ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Luke 6:9'>6:9</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 12:2–3'>Mt 12:2–3</a> , <a ref='Matthew 12:10'>10</a></i> ). Their Sabbath traditions actually placed a higher value on animals than on people in distress—and therefore corrupted the whole purpose of the Sabbath ( <a ref='Mark 2:27'>Mk 2:27</a> ). <a ref='Luke 13:16'>13:16</a> <b>a daughter of Abraham.</b> She was a Jewess. <b>whom Satan has bound.</b> Job’s physical ailments and other disasters were also inflicted by Satan, with divine permission. This woman had apparently been permitted to suffer, not because of any evil she had done, but so that the glory of God might be manifest in her (cf. <a ref='John 9:3'>Jn 9:3</a> ). <a ref='Luke 13:19'>13:19</a> , <a ref='Luke 13:21'>21</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 13:32–33'>Mt 13:32–33</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 13:22'>13:22</a> <b>from one city and village to another.</b> Luke’s geographical points of reference are often vague; the readers he had in mind were probably largely unfamiliar with Palestinian geography anyway. <a ref='Matthew 19:1'>Matthew 19:1</a> ; <a ref='Mark 10:1'>Mark 10:1</a> ; and <a ref='John 10:40'>John 10:40</a> all say that Christ moved His ministry to the region east of the Jordan, known as Perea. That move probably took place at about this point in Luke’s narrative. Therefore the cities and villages He traveled through may have included places in both Judea and Perea. <b>proceeding … to Jerusalem.</b> During His ministry in Judea to Perea, Christ actually went to Jerusalem on more than one occasion—at least once for the Feast of Tabernacles ( <a ref='John 7:11–8:59'>Jn 7:11—8:59</a> ), another time for the Feast of Dedication ( <a ref='John 9:1–10:39'>Jn 9:1—10:39</a> ), and another time when He raised Lazarus. Luke’s focus was on Christ’s constant progression toward His final trek to Jerusalem for the express purpose of dying there—and he therefore described all Christ’s traveling as one long trek toward Jerusalem. <i>See notes on <a ref='Luke 9:51'>9:51</a> ; <a ref='Luke 17:11'>17:11</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 13:23'>13:23</a> <b>are there</b> just <b>a few who are being saved?</b> That question may have been prompted by a number of factors. The great multitudes that had once followed Christ were subsiding to a faithful few (cf. <a ref='John 6:66'>Jn 6:66</a> ). Great crowds still came to hear ( <a ref='Luke 14:25'>14:25</a> ), but committed followers were increasingly scarce. Moreover, Christ’s messages often seemed designed to discourage the half-hearted ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 14:33'>14:33</a></i> ). And He Himself had stated that the way is so narrow that few find it ( <a ref='Matthew 7:14'>Mt 7:14</a> ). This contradicted the Jewish belief that all Jews, except for tax collectors and other notorious sinners, would be saved. Christ’s reply once again underscored the difficulty of entering at the narrow gate. After the resurrection, only 120 disciples gathered in the upper room in Jerusalem ( <a ref='Acts 1:15'>Ac 1:15</a> ), and only about 500 in Galilee ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:6'>1Co 15:6</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Luke 24:34'>24:34</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 28:16'>Mt 28:16</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 13:24'>13:24</a> <b>Strive.</b> This signifies a great struggle against conflict. Christ was not suggesting that anyone could <i>merit</i> heaven by striving for it. No matter how rigorously they labored, sinners could never save themselves. Salvation is solely by grace, not by works ( <a ref='Ephesians 2:8–9'>Eph 2:8–9</a> ). But entering the narrow gate is nonetheless difficult because of its cost in terms of human pride, because of the sinner’s natural love for sin, and because of the world’s and Satan’s opposition to the truth. <i>See notes on <a ref='Luke 16:16'>16:16</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 11:12'>Mt 11:12</a> .</i> <b>many … will seek to enter.</b> I.e., at the judgment, when many will protest that they deserve entrance into heaven (cf. <a ref='Matthew 7:21–23'>Mt 7:21–23</a> ). <a ref='Luke 13:25'>13:25</a> <b>I do not know … you.</b> Cf. <a ref='Matthew 7:23'>Mt 7:23</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 25:12'>25:12</a> . Clearly, no relationship ever existed, though they had deluded themselves into thinking they knew the owner of the house (v. <a ref='Luke 13:26'>26</a> ). Despite their protests, He repeated His denial emphatically in v. <a ref='Luke 13:27'>27</a> . <a ref='Luke 13:28'>13:28</a> <b>weeping and gnashing of teeth.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 22:13'>Mt 22:13</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 13:29'>13:29</a> <b>they will come.</b> By including people from the 4 corners of the earth, Jesus made it clear that even Gentiles would be invited to the heavenly banquet table. This was contrary to prevailing rabbinical thought, but perfectly consistent with the OT Scriptures ( <a ref='Psalms 107:3'>Ps 107:3</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 66:18–19'>Is 66:18–19</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 1:11'>Mal 1:11</a> ). <i>See notes on <a ref='Luke 2:31'>2:31</a> ; <a ref='Mark 13:27'>Mk 13:27</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 13:30'>13:30</a> <b>last … first … first … last.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 20:16'>Mt 20:16</a> .</i> In this context the saying seems to contrast Jews (“the first”) and Gentiles (“the last”). <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 14:11'>14:11</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 13:31'>13:31</a> <b>go from here.</b> Herod Antipas ruled Galilee and Perea ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 2:22'>Mt 2:22</a></i> ). Christ was probably either approaching Perea or ministering there already ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 13:22'>22</a></i> ). The Pharisees—no friends of Herod themselves—may have warned Christ because they hoped the threat of violence from Herod would either silence Him—or drive Him back to Judea, where the Sanhedrin would have jurisdiction over Him. <a ref='Luke 13:32'>13:32</a> <b>that fox.</b> Some have suggested that Jesus’ use of this expression is hard to reconcile with <a ref='Exodus 22:28'>Ex 22:28</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 10:20'>Ecc 10:20</a> ; and <a ref='Acts 23:5'>Ac 23:5</a> . However, those verses apply to everyday discourse. Prophets, speaking as mouthpieces of God, and with divine authority, were often commissioned to rebuke leaders publicly (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 1:23'>Is 1:23</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 22:27'>Eze 22:27</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 7:3–7'>Hos 7:3–7</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 3:3'>Zep 3:3</a> ). Since Jesus spoke with perfect divine authority, He had every right to speak of Herod in such terms. Rabbinical writings often used “the fox” to signify someone who was both crafty and worthless. The Pharisees, who trembled at Herod’s power, must have been astonished at Christ’s boldness. <b>today and tomorrow, and on the third</b> day. This expression signified only that Christ was on His own divine timetable; it was not meant to lay out a literal 3-day schedule. Expressions like this were common in Semitic usage, and seldom were employed in a literal sense to specify precise intervals of time. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 12:40'>Mt 12:40</a> .</i> <b>finish.</b> I.e., by death, in the finishing of His work. Cf. <a ref='John 17:4–5'>Jn 17:4–5</a> ; <a ref='John 19:30'>19:30</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 2:10'>Heb 2:10</a> . Herod was threatening to kill Him, but no one could kill Christ before His time ( <a ref='John 10:17–18'>Jn 10:17–18</a> ). <a ref='Luke 13:33'>13:33</a> <b>it is not possible.</b> Not all prophets who were martyred died in Jerusalem, of course. John the Baptist, for example, was beheaded by Herod, probably at Herod’s palace in Machaerus. This saying was probably a familiar proverb, like the adage in <a ref='Luke 4:24'>4:24</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 13:57'>Mt 13:57</a> . The statement is full of irony, noting that most of the OT prophets were martyred at the hands of the Jewish people, not by foreign enemies. Luke’s inclusion of this saying underscores his theme in this section of his Gospel—Jesus’ relentless journey to Jerusalem for the purpose of dying ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 9:51'>9:51</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 13:34'>13:34</a> <b>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem.</b> There is great tenderness in these words, as seen in the imagery of a hen with chickens. This outpouring of divine compassion foreshadows His weeping over the city as He approached it for the final time ( <a ref='Luke 19:41'>19:41</a> ). Clearly, these are deep and sincere emotions ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 9:36'>Mt 9:36</a></i> ). <b>I wanted … you did not want</b> it <b>.</b> Lit. “I willed, but you willed not.” Christ’s repeated expressions of grief over the plight of Jerusalem do not diminish the reality of His absolute sovereignty over all that happens. Nor should the truth of divine sovereignty be used to depreciate the sincerity of His compassion. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 23:37'>Mt 23:37</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 13:35'>13:35</a> This account of Luke’s clearly falls at an earlier point in Christ’s ministry than the parallel account in <a ref='Matthew 23:37–39'>Mt 23:37–39</a> , which took place in the temple during Christ’s final days in Jerusalem. The wording of the two laments is nonetheless virtually identical. Here Christ delivers prophetically the same message He would later pronounce as a final judgment. Blessed <b>.</b> Quotation from <a ref='Psalms 118:26'>Ps 118:26</a> . <a ref='Luke 14:1'>14:1</a> <b>Sabbath.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 13:10'>13:10</a> .</i> Luke shows Christ healing on the Sabbath more frequently than any of the other Gospels. Christ seems to have favored the Sabbath as a day for doing acts of mercy. <b>watching Him closely.</b> Evidently, the Pharisee had less than honorable motives for inviting Him to a meal. <a ref='Luke 14:2'>14:2</a> <b>dropsy.</b> A condition where fluid is retained in the tissues and cavities of the body—often caused by kidney or liver ailments, including cancer. <a ref='Luke 14:3'>14:3</a> <b>scholars of the Law.</b> I.e., scribes. <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 10:25'>10:25</a> .</i> <b>Is it lawful.</b> He had repeatedly defended Sabbath healings, and His arguments consistently silenced the nay-sayers (cf. <a ref='Luke 6:9–10'>6:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Luke 13:14–17'>13:14–17</a> ). Here and in <a ref='Luke 6:9'>6:9</a> , He questioned the scribes about the legality of healing on the Sabbath beforehand—and still they could give no cogent reasons why they believed healing was a violation of Sabbath laws (cf. v. <a ref='Luke 14:6'>6</a> ). <a ref='Luke 14:5'>14:5</a> <b>an ox.</b> Cf. <a ref='Luke 13:15'>13:15</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 12:11–12'>Mt 12:11–12</a> .

Should not the same principles be applied in showing mercy to suffering people? <a ref='Luke 14:7'>14:7</a> <b>places of honor.</b> I.e., the best seats at the table. Cf. <a ref='Luke 11:43'>11:43</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 23:6'>Mt 23:6</a> . <a ref='Luke 14:11'>14:11</a> <b>who exalts himself will be humbled.</b> Jesus favored this sort of paradoxical play on words (cf. <a ref='Luke 9:24'>9:24</a> ; <a ref='Luke 13:30'>13:30</a> ; <a ref='Luke 17:33'>17:33</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:14'>18:14</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 23:11–12'>Mt 23:11–12</a> ). This comment made the point of vv. <a ref='Luke 14:8–10'>8–10</a> clear. The point of this whole lesson closely parallels <a ref='Proverbs 25:6–7'>Pr 25:6–7</a> . <a ref='Luke 14:12'>14:12</a> <b>do not invite your friends or your brothers.</b> Clearly, this is not to be taken as an absolute prohibition against inviting friends or relatives to a meal. Christ employed similar hyperbole in v. <a ref='Luke 14:26'>26</a> . Such language is common in Semitic discourse and is used for emphasis. His point here is that inviting one’s friends and relatives cannot be classified as a spiritual act of true charity. It may also be a rebuke against those prone to reserve their hospitality for “rich neighbors” who they know will feel obligated to return the favor. Cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 14:28–29'>Dt 14:28–29</a> . <a ref='Luke 14:14'>14:14</a> <b>repaid … at the resurrection.</b> I.e., with treasure in heaven (cf. <a ref='Luke 18:22'>18:22</a> ). <a ref='Luke 14:15'>14:15</a> <b>everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom.</b> The man probably held the common view that only Jews would be invited to the heavenly feast ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 8:12'>Mt 8:12</a></i> ). Perhaps this was an idle or pious saying, made without much serious reflection. Christ replied with a parable that pictures the inclusion of Gentiles. <a ref='Luke 14:16'>14:16</a> <b>a big dinner.</b> This parable, similar in many ways to the one in <a ref='Matthew 22:2–14'>Mt 22:2–14</a> , and making the same point, is nonetheless distinct. That parable was told on a different occasion, and some key details differ. <b>invited many.</b> Apparently, no one declined the invitation. The man evidently had every reason to expect that all who were invited would attend. <a ref='Luke 14:17'>14:17</a> <b>those who had been invited.</b> Guests for a wedding, which could last a full week, were preinvited and given a general idea of the time. When all the many preparations were finally ready, the preinvited guests were notified that the event would commence. The preinvited guests refer to the people of Israel, who by the OT had been told to be ready for the arrival of the Messiah. <a ref='Luke 14:18'>14:18</a> <b>excuses.</b> All the excuses smack of insincerity. One does not purchase property without seeing it first. And since the purchase was already complete, there was no urgency. The land would still be there after the banquet. Likewise (v. <a ref='Luke 14:19'>19</a> ), one does not purchase oxen without first testing them. The man who had recently married (v. <a ref='Luke 14:20'>20</a> ) was excused from business travel, or serving in the military ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:5'>Dt 24:5</a> ), but there was no legitimate reason for newlyweds to avoid such a social engagement. <a ref='Luke 14:21'>14:21</a> <b>the poor and crippled and blind and lame.</b> I.e., people the Pharisees tended to regard as unclean or unworthy. The religious leaders condemned Jesus for His associations with prostitutes and tax collectors (cf. <a ref='Luke 5:29–30'>5:29–30</a> ; <a ref='Luke 15:1'>15:1</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 9:10–11'>Mt 9:10–11</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 11:19'>11:19</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 21:31–32'>21:31–32</a> ; <a ref='Mark 2:15–16'>Mk 2:15–16</a> ). <a ref='Luke 14:22'>14:22</a> <b>still there is room.</b> God is more willing to save sinners than sinners are to be saved. <a ref='Luke 14:23'>14:23</a> <b>into the highways and along the fences.</b> This evidently represents the Gentile regions. <b>compel</b> them <b>to come in.</b> I.e., not by force or violence, but by earnest persuasion. <a ref='Luke 14:24'>14:24</a> <b>none of those men who were invited.</b> I.e., those who refused. Having spurned the invitation, Israel was shut out of the banquet. The master’s judgment against them was to seal their own decision. Most of them were killed by divine judgment at the hands of the Romans in AD 70. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 22:7'>Mt 22:7</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 23:36'>23:36</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:2'>24:2</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 14:25'>14:25</a> <b>many crowds.</b> Christ’s aim was not to gather appreciative crowds, but to make true disciples ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 13:23'>13:23</a></i> ). He never adapted His message to majority preferences, but always plainly declared the high cost of discipleship. Here He made several bold demands that would discourage the half-hearted. <a ref='Luke 14:26'>14:26</a> <b>hate.</b> A similar statement in <a ref='Matthew 10:37'>Mt 10:37</a> is the key to understanding this difficult command. The “hatred” called for here is actually a lesser love. Jesus was calling His disciples to cultivate such a devotion to Him that their attachment to everything else—including their own lives—would seem like hatred by comparison. See <a ref='Luke 16:13'>16:13</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 29:30–31'>Ge 29:30–31</a> for similar usages of the word “hate.” <a ref='Luke 14:27'>14:27</a> <b>carry his own cross.</b> I.e., willingly. This parallels the idea of hating one’s own life in v. <a ref='Luke 14:26'>26</a> . <i>See notes on <a ref='Luke 9:23'>9:23</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 10:38'>Mt 10:38</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Mark 8:34'>Mk 8:34</a> . <a ref='Luke 14:28'>14:28</a> <b>calculate the cost.</b> The multitudes were positive but uncommitted. Far from making it easy for them to respond positively, He set the cost of discipleship as high as possible (vv. <a ref='Luke 14:26–27'>26–27</a> , <a ref='Luke 14:33'>33</a> )—and encouraged them to do a careful inventory before declaring their willingness to follow. Cf. <a ref='Luke 9:57–62'>9:57–62</a> . <a ref='Luke 14:33'>14:33</a> <b>give up all.</b> Only those willing to carefully assess the cost (vv. <a ref='Luke 14:28–32'>28–32</a> ) and invest all they had in His kingdom were worthy to enter. This speaks of something far more than mere abandonment of one’s material possessions; it is an absolute, unconditional surrender. His disciples were permitted to retain no privileges and make no demands. They were to safeguard no cherished sins; treasure no earthly possessions; and cling to no secret self-indulgences. Their commitment to Him must be without reservation. <i>See notes on <a ref='Luke 9:23–26'>9:23–26</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 14:34'>14:34</a> <b>salt is good.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 5:13'>Mt 5:13</a> ; <a ref='Mark 9:50'>Mk 9:50</a> .</i> Christ employed this same imagery on at least 3 different occasions in His ministry. <a ref='Luke 15:1'>15:1</a> <b>the tax collectors and the sinners.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Luke 14:21'>14:21</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 5:46'>Mt 5:46</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 21:32'>21:32</a> .</i> Despite the difficulties of Christ’s message ( <a ref='Luke 14:25–35'>14:25–35</a> ), the outcasts of society were drawn to Him, while the religious leaders grew more and more determined to kill Him. Cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:26–29'>1Co 1:26–29</a> . <a ref='Luke 15:2'>15:2</a> <b>were grumbling.</b> Lit. “murmured greatly”—i.e., through the crowds. Their grumbling prompted 3 parables designed to illustrate the joy of God over the repentance of sinners. <b>This man receives sinners.</b> This phrase is the key to the trilogy of parables that follow. Christ was not ashamed to be known as a “friend of tax collectors and sinners” ( <a ref='Luke 7:34'>7:34</a> ). <a ref='Luke 15:4'>15:4</a> <b>go after the one which is lost.</b> The first two parables both picture God as taking the initiative in seeking sinners. The rabbis taught that God would receive sinners who sought His forgiveness earnestly enough, but here God is the One seeking the sinner ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 19:10'>19:10</a></i> ). The shepherd in the Middle East was responsible for every sheep. He was obligated to his master to see that none was lost, killed, or injured (cf. <a ref='Matthew 18:11–14'>Mt 18:11–14</a> ). <a ref='Luke 15:5'>15:5</a> <b>lays it on his shoulders.</b> The picture of a loving shepherd. Cf. <a ref='John 10:11'>Jn 10:11</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 24:1'>Ps 24:1</a> . <b>rejoicing.</b> Joy over the return of the lost is the most prominent feature in all 3 parables (vv. <a ref='Luke 15:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Luke 15:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Luke 15:32'>32</a> ). <a ref='Luke 15:7'>15:7</a> <b>joy in heaven.</b> A reference to the joy of God Himself. There was complaining on earth, among the Pharisees (v. <a ref='Luke 15:2'>2</a> ); but there was great joy with God and among the angels (v. <a ref='Luke 15:10'>10</a> ). <b>persons who need no repentance.</b> I.e., those who think themselves righteous (cf. <a ref='Luke 5:32'>5:32</a> ; <a ref='Luke 16:15'>16:15</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:9'>18:9</a> ). <a ref='Luke 15:8'>15:8</a> <b>drachmas.</b> The drachma was a Greek coin roughly equivalent in value to the Roman denarius ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 22:19'>Mt 22:19</a></i> ). <b>light a lamp.</b> The typical one-room house had no windows. <b>sweep the house.</b> This illustrates the thoroughness of the search. <a ref='Luke 15:11–12'>15:11–12</a> The parable of the prodigal son is the most familiar and beloved of all Christ’s parables. It is one of the longest and most detailed parables. And unlike most parables, it has more than one lesson. The prodigal is an example of sound repentance. The elder brother illustrates the wickedness of the Pharisees’ self-righteousness, prejudice, and indifference toward repenting sinners. And the father pictures God, eager to forgive, and longing for the return of the sinner. The main feature, however, as in the other two parables in this chapter, is the joy of God, the celebrations that fill heaven when a sinner repents. <a ref='Luke 15:12'>15:12</a> <b>give me the share of the estate that falls</b> to me <b>.</b> A shocking request, tantamount to saying he wished his father were dead. He was not entitled to any inheritance while his father still lived. Yet the father graciously fulfilled the request, giving him his full share, which would have been one-third of the entire estate—because the right of the firstborn ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 21:17'>Dt 21:17</a> ) gave the elder brother a double portion. This act pictures all sinners (related to God the Father by creation) who waste their potential privileges and refuse any relationship with Him, choosing instead a life of sinful self-indulgence. <a ref='Luke 15:13'>15:13</a> <b>gathered everything together.</b> The prodigal son evidently took his share in liquid assets, and left, abandoning his father, and heading into a life of iniquity. <b>living recklessly.</b> Not merely wasteful extravagance, but also wanton immorality (v. <a ref='Luke 15:30'>30</a> ). The Greek word for “recklessly” means “dissolute,” or “wasteful,” and conveys the idea of an utterly debauched lifestyle. <a ref='Luke 15:15'>15:15</a> <b>to feed swine.</b> This was the worst sort of degradation imaginable for Jesus’ Jewish audience; swine were the worst sort of unclean animals. <a ref='Luke 15:16'>15:16</a> <b>was desiring to be fed with the pods.</b> I.e., carob pods, used to feed swine but virtually undigestible for humans. In other words, the only reason he did not eat the same food as the swine is that he could not. <b>no one was giving</b> anything <b>to him.</b> He could not even eke out a living by begging. His situation could hardly have been more desperate. Thus he symbolizes the estranged sinner who is helpless in despair. <a ref='Luke 15:17'>15:17</a> <b>came to himself.</b> When his incessant sinning had left him utterly bankrupt and hungry, he was able to think more clearly. In that condition, he was a candidate for salvation ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 5:3–6'>Mt 5:3–6</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 15:18'>15:18</a> <b>will say to him.</b> He carefully contemplated what he would say and counted the cost of his repentance (v. <a ref='Luke 15:19'>19</a> ). <b>sinned against heaven.</b> A euphemism, meaning he had sinned against God. He not only realized the futility of his situation, but he also understood the gravity of his transgressions against the father. <a ref='Luke 15:20'>15:20</a> <b>his father saw him.</b> Clearly, the father had been waiting and looking for his son’s return. <b>ran.</b> The father’s eagerness and joy at his son’s return is unmistakable. This is the magnificent attribute of God that sets Him apart from all the false gods invented by men and demons. He is not indifferent or hostile, but a Savior by nature, longing to see sinners repent and rejoicing when they do. <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Timothy 2:4'>1Ti 2:4</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 4:10'>4:10</a> .</i> From <a ref='Genesis 3:8'>Ge 3:8</a> to <a ref='Revelation 22:17'>Rev 22:17</a> , from the fall to the consummation, God has been and will be seeking to save sinners, and rejoicing each time one repents and is converted. <a ref='Luke 15:21'>15:21</a> Note that the son did not get to finish his rehearsed words of repentance before the father interrupted to grant forgiveness. This pictures God’s eagerness to forgive. <a ref='Luke 15:22'>15:22</a> <b>the father said.</b> Without a single word of rebuke for the past, the father pours out his love for the son, and expresses his joy that what was lost had been found. Each of the father’s gifts said something unique about his acceptance of the son: <b>robe.</b> Reserved for the guest of honor. <b>ring.</b> A symbol of authority. <b>sandals.</b> These were not usually worn by slaves, and therefore signified his full restoration to sonship. <a ref='Luke 15:23'>15:23</a> <b>the fattened calf.</b> Reserved only for the most special of occasions—a sacrifice or a feast of great celebration. All this (vv. <a ref='Luke 15:22–23'>22–23</a> ) symbolizes the lavishness of salvation’s blessings (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 1:3'>Eph 1:3</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:4–7'>2:4–7</a> ). <a ref='Luke 15:25'>15:25</a> <b>older son.</b> He symbolizes the Pharisee, the hypocritical religious person, who stays close to the place of the Father (the temple) but has no sense of sin, no real love for the Father (so as to share in His joy), and no interest in repenting sinners. <a ref='Luke 15:28'>15:28</a> <b>he became angry.</b> This parallels the complaining done by the scribes and Pharisees (v. <a ref='Luke 15:2'>2</a> ). <a ref='Luke 15:29'>15:29</a> <b>never have I neglected a command of yours.</b> Unlikely, given the boy’s obvious contempt for his father, shown by his refusal to participate in the father’s great joy. This statement reveals the telltale problem with all religious hypocrites. They will not recognize their sin and repent ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 9:12–13'>Mt 9:12–13</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 19:16–20'>19:16–20</a></i> ). The elder son’s comment reeks of the same spirit as the words of the Pharisee in <a ref='Luke 18:11'>18:11</a> . <b>never have you given me a young goat.</b> All those years of service to the father appear to have been motivated too much by concern for what he could get for himself. This son’s self-righteous behavior was more socially acceptable than the younger brother’s debauchery, but it was equally dishonoring to the father—and called for repentance. <a ref='Luke 15:30'>15:30</a> <b>this son of yours.</b> An expression of deep contempt (cf. “this tax collector” in <a ref='Luke 18:11'>18:11</a> ). He could not bring himself to refer to him as “my brother.” <a ref='Luke 15:31'>15:31</a> <b>all that is mine is yours.</b> The inheritance had already been distributed (v. <a ref='Luke 15:12'>12</a> ). Everything the father had was literally in the elder son’s possession. Yet the elder son was begrudging even the love the father showed to the prodigal son. The Pharisees and scribes had easy access to all the riches of God’s truth. They spent their lives dealing with Scripture and public worship—but they never really possessed any of the treasures enjoyed by the repentant sinner. <a ref='Luke 15:32'>15:32</a> <b>we had to celebrate and rejoice.</b> This summarizes the point of all 3 parables. <b>brother of yours.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 15:30'>30</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 16:1'>16:1</a> <b>steward.</b> A steward was a trusted servant, usually someone born in the household, who was chief of the management and distribution of household provisions. He provided food for all the other servants, thus managing his master’s resources for the well-being of others. He acted as an agent for his master, with full authority to transact business in the master’s name. <b>squandering his possessions.</b> His prodigality is a thread that ties this parable to the preceding one. Like the younger son in the earlier parable, this manager was guilty of wasting the resources available to him. Unlike the prodigal, however, he had enough sense to make sure that his wastefulness did not leave him friendless and unprovided for in the future. <a ref='Luke 16:2'>16:2</a> <b>you can no longer be steward.</b> By announcing his intention to fire the man, the owner acted unwisely, and it cost him even more. Evidently, he thought the man guilty of incompetence, rather than fraud. That would explain his reaction in v. <a ref='Luke 16:8'>8</a> . <a ref='Luke 16:3'>16:3</a> <b>not strong enough to dig.</b> I.e., he did not consider himself fit for physical labor. <a ref='Luke 16:4'>16:4</a> <b>know what I shall do.</b> Cleverly, he arranged to give large discounts to his master’s debtors, which they would eagerly agree to pay. <b>take me into their homes.</b> By reducing their debts to his master, he gained their indebtedness to him. They would thus be obligated to take him into their homes when he was put out of his master’s home. <a ref='Luke 16:6'>16:6</a> <b>quickly.</b> This was a secret transaction, unauthorized by the master. The borrower was guilty of deliberate complicity in the man’s fraud. <a ref='Luke 16:8'>16:8</a> <b>his master praised the unrighteous steward.</b> Outwitted, he applauded the man’s cunning. His admiration for the evil steward’s criminal genius shows that he, too, was a wicked man. It is the natural tendency of fallen hearts to admire a villain’s craftiness ( <a ref='Psalms 49:18'>Ps 49:18</a> ). Note that all the characters in this parable are unjust, unscrupulous, and corrupt. <b>more shrewd.</b> I.e., most unbelievers are wiser in the ways of the world than some believers (“sons of light,” cf. <a ref='John 12:36'>Jn 12:36</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:18'>Eph 5:18</a> ) are toward the things of God. <a ref='Luke 16:9'>16:9</a> <b>wealth of unrighteousness.</b> I.e., money. The unrighteous manager used his master’s money to buy earthly friends; believers are to use their Master’s money in a way that will accrue friends for eternity—by investing in the kingdom gospel that brings sinners to salvation, so that when they arrive in heaven (“eternal dwellings”), those sinners will be there to welcome them. Christ did not commend the man’s dishonesty; He pointedly called him “unrighteous” (v. <a ref='Luke 16:8'>8</a> ). He only used him as an illustration to show that even the most wicked sons of this world are shrewd enough to provide for themselves against coming evil. Believers ought to be more shrewd, because they are concerned with eternal matters, not just earthly ones. Cf. <a ref='Luke 12:33'>12:33</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 6:19–21'>Mt 6:19–21</a> . <a ref='Luke 16:10'>16:10</a> <b>He who is faithful.</b> Probably a common proverb. Cf. <a ref='Luke 19:17'>19:17</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 25:21'>Mt 25:21</a> . <a ref='Luke 16:11'>16:11</a> <b>true</b> riches. Faithful use of one’s earthly wealth is repeatedly tied to the accumulation of treasure in heaven (cf. <a ref='Luke 12:33'>12:33</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:22'>18:22</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 6:19–21'>Mt 6:19–21</a> ). <a ref='Luke 16:12'>16:12</a> <b>that which is another’s.</b> This refers to God, and the believer’s stewardship of His money, which believers only manage as stewards. <a ref='Luke 16:13'>16:13</a> <b>You cannot serve God and wealth.</b> Many of the Pharisees taught that devotion to money and devotion to God were perfectly compatible (v. <a ref='Luke 16:14'>14</a> ). This went hand-in-hand with the commonly held notion that earthly riches signified divine blessing. Rich people were therefore regarded as God’s favorites ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 19:24'>Mt 19:24</a></i> ). While not condemning wealth per se, Christ denounced both love of wealth and devotion to mammon. On the love of money, <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Timothy 6:9–10'>1Ti 6:9–10</a> , <a ref='1 Timothy 6:17–19'>17–19</a></i> . <a ref='Luke 16:15'>16:15</a> <b>justify yourselves.</b> The Pharisees’ belief was that their own goodness was what justified them (cf. <a ref='Romans 10:3'>Ro 10:3</a> ). This is the very definition of “self-righteousness.” But, as Jesus suggested, their righteousness was flawed, being an external veneer only. That might be enough to justify them before men, but not before God, because He knew their hearts. He repeatedly exposed their habit of seeking the approval of people (cf. <a ref='Matthew 6:2'>Mt 6:2</a> , <a ref='Matthew 6:5'>5</a> , <a ref='Matthew 6:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 23:28'>23:28</a> ). <a ref='Luke 16:16'>16:16</a> <b>until John.</b> John the Baptist’s ministry marked the turning point of redemptive history. Prior to that, the great truths of Christ and His kingdom were veiled in the types and shadows of the law, and promised in the writings of the prophets (cf. <a ref='1 Peter 1:10–12'>1Pe 1:10–12</a> ). But John the Baptist introduced the King Himself ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 11:11'>Mt 11:11</a></i> ). The Pharisees, who thought of themselves as experts in the Law and the Prophets, missed the significance of the very One to whom the Law and the Prophets pointed. <b>everyone is forcing his way into it.</b> Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 29:13'>Jer 29:13</a> . While the Pharisees were busy opposing Christ, sinners were entering His kingdom in droves. The language of this expression speaks of violent force—probably signifying the zeal with which sinners were seeking with all of their heart to enter the kingdom ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Luke 13:24'>13:24</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 55:6–7'>Is 55:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 11:12'>Mt 11:12</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 16:17'>16:17</a> <b>than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail.</b> Lest anyone think the statement in v. <a ref='Luke 16:16'>16</a> meant He was declaring the law and the prophets annulled, He added this ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 5:18'>Mt 5:18</a></i> ). The great moral principles of the law, the eternal truths contained in the law’s types and symbols, and the promises recorded by the prophets all remain in force and are not abrogated by the kingdom message. <a ref='Luke 16:18'>16:18</a> <b>commits adultery.</b> I.e., if the divorce had no legitimate grounds. Luke gave an abbreviated record of Jesus’ teaching on divorce, stressing only the main issue. Matthew’s fuller account makes it clear that He permitted divorce in cases where one’s spouse was guilty of adultery. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 5:31–32'>Mt 5:31–32</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 19:3–9'>19:3–9</a> .</i> This countered the rabbis’ doctrine, which permitted men to divorce their wives easily, and for almost any cause ( <a ref='Matthew 19:3'>Mt 19:3</a> ). <a ref='Luke 16:20'>16:20</a> <b>Lazarus.</b> Clearly not the Lazarus in <a ref='Jn 11'>Jn 11</a> (who died at a later time). This beggar was the only character in any of Jesus’ parables ever given a name. Some therefore have speculated that this was no imaginary tale, but an actual incident that really took place. Either way, Christ employs it in the same fashion as all His parables, to teach a lesson, in this case for the benefit of the Pharisees. The rich man in the parable is sometimes called <i>Dives</i> , after the Latin word for “rich.” <a ref='Luke 16:21'>16:21</a> The mention of crumbs, sores, and dogs all made this poor man appear odious in the eyes of the Pharisees. They were inclined to see all such things as proof of divine disfavor. They would have viewed such a person as not only unclean, but also despised by God. <a ref='Luke 16:22'>16:22</a> <b>Abraham’s bosom.</b> This same expression (found only here in Scripture) was used in the Talmud as a figure for heaven. The idea was that Lazarus was given a place of high honor, reclining next to Abraham at the heavenly banquet. <a ref='Luke 16:23'>16:23</a> <b>in Hades.</b> The suggestion that a rich man would be excluded from heaven would have scandalized the Pharisees ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 19:24'>Mt 19:24</a></i> ); especially galling was the idea that a beggar who ate scraps from his table was granted the place of honor next to Abraham. “Hades” was the Greek term for the abode of the dead. In the LXX, it was used to translate the Hebrew <i>Sheol</i> , which referred to the realm of the dead in general, without necessarily distinguishing between righteous or unrighteous souls. However, in NT usage, “Hades” always refers to the place of the wicked prior to final judgment in hell. The imagery Jesus used paralleled the common rabbinical idea that Sheol had two parts, one for the souls of the righteous and the other for the souls of the wicked—separated by an impassable gulf. But there is no reason to suppose, as some do, that “Abraham’s bosom” spoke of a temporary prison for the souls of OT saints, who were brought to heaven only after He had actually atoned for their sins. Scripture consistently teaches that the spirits of the righteous dead go immediately into the presence of God (cf. <a ref='Luke 23:43'>23:43</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:8'>2Co 5:8</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 1:23'>Php 1:23</a> ). And the presence of Moses and Elijah on the Mount of Transfiguration ( <a ref='Luke 9:30'>9:30</a> ) belies the notion that they were confined in a compartment of Sheol until Christ finished His work. <a ref='Luke 16:24'>16:24</a> <b>I am in agony.</b> Christ pictured Hades as a place where the unspeakable torment of hell had already begun. Among the miseries featured here are unquenchable flame ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 25:46'>Mt 25:46</a></i> ); an accusing conscience fed by undying memories of lost opportunity (v. <a ref='Luke 16:25'>25</a> ); and permanent, irreversible separation from God and everything good (v. <a ref='Luke 16:26'>26</a> ). <a ref='Luke 16:27'>16:27</a> <b>send him to my father’s house.</b> The rich man retained a condescending attitude toward Lazarus even in hell, repeatedly asking Abraham to “send” Lazarus to wait on him (cf. v. <a ref='Luke 16:24'>24</a> ). The flames of hell do not atone for sin or purge hardened sinners from their depravity (cf. <a ref='Revelation 22:11'>Rev 22:11</a> ). <a ref='Luke 16:29'>16:29</a> <b>They have Moses and the Prophets.</b> I.e., the OT Scriptures. <a ref='Luke 16:31'>16:31</a> <b>they will not be persuaded.</b> This speaks powerfully of the singular sufficiency of Scripture to overcome unbelief. The gospel itself is the power of God unto salvation ( <a ref='Romans 1:16'>Ro 1:16</a> ). Since unbelief is at heart a moral, rather than an intellectual, problem, no amount of evidences will ever turn unbelief to faith. But the revealed Word of God has inherent power to do so (cf. <a ref='John 6:63'>Jn 6:63</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 4:12'>Heb 4:12</a> ; <a ref='James 1:18'>Jas 1:18</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:23'>1Pe 1:23</a> ). <a ref='Luke 17:1'>17:1</a> <b>stumbling blocks.</b> Lit. “snares.” <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 18:7'>Mt 18:7</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 17:2'>17:2</a> <b>a millstone.</b> Lit. “the millstone of a donkey.” <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 18:6'>Mt 18:6</a> .</i> <b>little ones.</b> Believers; God’s children who are under His care. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 18:5'>Mt 18:5</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 17:3'>17:3</a> <b>rebuke him.</b> It is the Christian’s duty to deal straightforwardly with a brother or sister in sin. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 18:15'>Mt 18:15</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 17:4'>17:4</a> <b>seven times a day.</b> I.e., no matter how many times he sins and repents. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 18:21–22'>Mt 18:21–22</a> .</i> The number 7 was not to set a limit on the number of times to forgive (cf. <a ref='Psalms 119:164'>Ps 119:164</a> ), but precisely the opposite. Christ meant that forgiveness should be granted unendingly (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 4:32'>Eph 4:32</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 3:13'>Col 3:13</a> ). <a ref='Luke 17:5'>17:5</a> <b>Increase our faith!</b> Lit. “Give us more faith.” They felt inadequate in the face of the high standard He set for them. <a ref='Luke 17:6'>17:6</a> <b>faith like a mustard seed.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 17:20'>Mt 17:20</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 17:7–10'>17:7–10</a> The point of this parable was that a slave, or servant, should expect no special reward for doing what was his duty in the first place. The demanding standards Christ set (vv. <a ref='Luke 17:1–4'>1–4</a> ) may have seemed too high to the disciples, but they represented only the minimal duties for a servant of Christ. Those who obey are not to think their obedience is meritorious. <a ref='Luke 17:10'>17:10</a> <b>unworthy slaves.</b> I.e., not worthy of any special honor. <a ref='Luke 17:11'>17:11</a> <b>to Jerusalem … passing through Samaria and Galilee.</b> Luke did not explain the reason for such a circuitous route, but a comparison of the Gospels yields several clues. It appears that time elapsed between v. <a ref='Luke 17:10'>10</a> and v. <a ref='Luke 17:11'>11</a> . The raising of Lazarus at Bethany, near Jerusalem ( <a ref='Jn 11'>Jn 11</a> ), appears to fit into this time frame. <a ref='John 11:54'>John 11:54</a> states that after raising Lazarus, to avoid the authorities who were seeking to kill Him, Christ went to “a city called Ephraim”—north of Jerusalem near the border of Samaria. From there He apparently traveled north through Samaria and Galilee one more time, possibly to join friends and family from Galilee who would be making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the Passover. From there He would have traveled south by the conventional route, which would have brought Him through Jericho ( <a ref='Luke 18:35'>18:35</a> ) to Jerusalem. <i>See notes on <a ref='Luke 9:51'>9:51</a> ; <a ref='Luke 13:22'>13:22</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 17:12'>17:12</a> <b>leprous men.</b> These men were ceremonially defiled and forced to live outside the village ( <a ref='Leviticus 13:46'>Lv 13:46</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 5:2–3'>Nu 5:2–3</a> ). They were legally required to stand at a distance, and thus their communication with Christ was by shouting. For a description of leprosy, <i>see note on <a ref='Leviticus 13:2'>Lv 13:2</a></i> . <a ref='Luke 17:13'>17:13</a> <b>have mercy on us!</b> Cf. <a ref='Luke 16:24'>16:24</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:38–39'>18:38–39</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 9:27'>Mt 9:27</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 15:22'>15:22</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 17:15'>17:15</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 20:31'>20:31</a> ; <a ref='Mark 10:47–48'>Mk 10:47–48</a> . This was a common plea from those desiring healing. <a ref='Luke 17:14'>17:14</a> <b>show yourselves to the priests.</b> I.e., to be declared clean ( <a ref='Leviticus 13:2–3'>Lv 13:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 14:2–32'>14:2–32</a> ). <b>as they were going.</b> The healing was sudden and immediately visible, but occurred after they obeyed His command. <a ref='Luke 17:15'>17:15</a> <b>one of them … turned back.</b> His response was reminiscent of the conduct of Naaman ( <a ref='2 Kings 5:15'>2Ki 5:15</a> ). The others, eager to be declared clean so that they could return to normal life in society, evidently continued on to the priest, forgetting to give thanks. <a ref='Luke 17:16'>17:16</a> <b>he was a Samaritan.</b> Jesus’ sending the lepers to show themselves to the priest suggests that they were Jewish. This Samaritan had been permitted to associate with them when all were ceremonially unclean, but in their healing, they did not share his deep gratitude. <a ref='Luke 17:18'>17:18</a> <b>this foreigner.</b> Evidently Jesus did not view Samaritans as anything more or less than other Gentiles. <i>See note on <a ref='John 4:4'>Jn 4:4</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 17:19'>17:19</a> <b>saved you.</b> Lit. “saved you” (cf. <a ref='Matthew 9:22'>Mt 9:22</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Mark 5:34'>Mk 5:34</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 17:20'>17:20</a> <b>when the kingdom of God was coming.</b> They may have asked the question mockingly, having already concluded that He was not the Messiah. <b>not coming with</b> signs to be <b>observed.</b> The Pharisees believed that the Messiah’s triumph would be immediate. They were looking for Him to come, overthrow Rome, and set up the millennial kingdom. Christ’s program was altogether different. He was inaugurating an era in which the kingdom would be manifest in the rule of God in men’s hearts through faith in the Savior (v. <a ref='Luke 17:21'>21</a> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 14:17'>Ro 14:17</a> ). That kingdom was neither confined to a particular geographical location nor visible to human eyes. It would come quietly, invisibly, and without the normal pomp and splendor associated with the arrival of a king. Jesus did not suggest that the OT promises of an earthly kingdom were hereby nullified. Rather, that earthly, visible manifestation of the kingdom is yet to come ( <a ref='Revelation 20:1–6'>Rev 20:1–6</a> ). <a ref='Luke 17:21'>17:21</a> <b>in your midst.</b> I.e., within people’s hearts. The pronoun could hardly refer to the Pharisees in general. <a ref='Luke 17:22'>17:22</a> <b>The days will come.</b> This introduces a brief discourse that has some similarities to the Olivet Discourse of <a ref='Mt 24-25'>Mt 24–25</a> . <b>you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man.</b> I.e., desire to have Him physically present. This suggests a longing for His return to set things right (cf. <a ref='Revelation 6:9–11'>Rev 6:9–11</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 22:20'>22:20</a> ). <a ref='Luke 17:23–24'>17:23–24</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 24:26'>Mt 24:26</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 17:25'>17:25</a> <b>must suffer.</b> I.e., because it was the sovereign plan of God for Him to die as a substitute for sinners.

None of the things Jesus cited with regard to Noah’s day or Lot’s day were inherently sinful. But people were so absorbed in the things of this life that they were utterly unprepared when the time of judgment came. <a ref='Luke 17:31'>17:31</a> <b>housetop.</b> The typical house had a flat roof with an external stairway. The danger would be so great that those on the roofs should flee, without going into the house to retrieve anything. <a ref='Luke 17:32'>17:32</a> Lot’s wife was destroyed on the very threshold of deliverance. Her attachment to Sodom was so powerful that she delayed and looked back; she was overwhelmed by oncoming judgment, just before reaching the place of safety ( <a ref='Genesis 19:26'>Ge 19:26</a> ). <a ref='Luke 17:33'>17:33</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 14:11'>14:11</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 17:34–36'>17:34–36</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 24:40–41'>Mt 24:40–41</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 17:37'>17:37</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 24:28'>Mt 24:28</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 18:1'>18:1</a> <b>all times … pray.</b> A common theme in Paul’s epistles (see Introduction: Interpretive Challenges ).

Christ described him as “unjust” (v. <a ref='Luke 18:6'>6</a> )—like the manager in <a ref='Luke 16:8'>16:8</a> . The judge is not given as a symbol of God, but rather in contrast to Him. If such an unrighteous man would respond to persistent pleas, would not God, who is not only just, but also loving and merciful, do so more readily? <a ref='Luke 18:5'>18:5</a> <b>wears me out.</b> Lit. “hits under the eye.” What the judge would not do out of compassion for the widow or reverence for God, he would do out of sheer frustration with her incessant pleading. <a ref='Luke 18:6'>18:6</a> <b>Hear what the unjust judge said.</b> I.e., listen to the point of the story, namely, that God, who always does right and is filled with compassion for believers who suffer, will certainly respond to His beloved ones who cry for His help (v. <a ref='Luke 18:7'>7</a> ). <a ref='Luke 18:8'>18:8</a> <b>quickly.</b> He may delay long, but He does so for good reason (cf. <a ref='2 Peter 3:8–9'>2Pe 3:8–9</a> ) and when He acts, His vengeance is swift. <b>will He find that faith.</b> This suggests that when He returns, the true faith will be comparatively rare—as in the days of Noah ( <a ref='Luke 17:26'>17:26</a> ), when only 8 souls were saved. The period before His return will be marked by persecution, apostasy, and unbelief ( <a ref='Matthew 24:9–13'>Mt 24:9–13</a> , <a ref='Matthew 24:24'>24</a> ). <a ref='Luke 18:9'>18:9</a> This parable is rich with truth about the doctrine of justification by faith. It illustrates perfectly how a sinner who is utterly devoid of personal righteousness may be declared righteous before God instantaneously through an act of repentant faith. The parable is addressed to Pharisees who trusted their own righteousness (vv. <a ref='Luke 18:10–11'>10–11</a> ). Such confidence in one’s inherent righteousness is a damning hope (cf. <a ref='Romans 10:3'>Ro 10:3</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:9'>Php 3:9</a> ), because human righteousness—even the righteousness of the most fastidious Pharisee—falls short of the divine standard ( <a ref='Matthew 5:48'>Mt 5:48</a> ). Scripture consistently teaches that sinners are justified when God’s perfect righteousness is imputed to their account (cf. <a ref='Genesis 15:6'>Ge 15:6</a> ; <a ref='Romans 4:4–5'>Ro 4:4–5</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:4–9'>Php 3:4–9</a> )—and it was only on that basis that this tax collector (or anyone else) could be saved. <a ref='Luke 18:12'>18:12</a> <b>fast twice a week.</b> I.e., more than is required by any biblical standard ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 5:33'>5:33</a></i> ). By exalting his own works, the Pharisee revealed that his entire hope lay in his not being as bad as someone else. He lacked any sense of his own unworthiness and sin. Cf. vv. <a ref='Luke 18:18–21'>18–21</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 19:17–20'>Mt 19:17–20</a> . <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 17:7–10'>17:7–10</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 18:13'>18:13</a> The tax collector’s humility is notable in everything about his posture and behavior. Here was a man who had been made to face the reality of his own sin, and his only response was abject humility and repentance. He contrasts with the Pharisee in virtually every detail. <b>God, be merciful.</b> He had no hope but the mercy of God. This is the point to which the law aims to bring every sinner (cf. <a ref='Romans 3:19–20'>Ro 3:19–20</a> ; <a ref='Romans 7:13'>7:13</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:22–24'>Ga 3:22–24</a> ). <a ref='Luke 18:14'>18:14</a> <b>justified.</b> I.e., reckoned righteous before God by means of an imputed righteousness ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 18:9'>9</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 18:17'>18:17</a> <b>like a child.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 18:3'>Mt 18:3</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 18:18–30'>18:18–30</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 19:16–30'>Mt 19:16–30</a> ; <a ref='Mark 10:17–31'>Mk 10:17–31</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 18:20'>18:20</a> Quoted from <a ref='Exodus 20:12–16'>Ex 20:12–16</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:16–20'>Dt 5:16–20</a> . <a ref='Luke 18:31'>18:31</a> <b>all things … written through the prophets.</b> E.g., <a ref='Ps 22'>Pss 22</a> ; <a ref='Ps 69'>69</a> ; <a ref='Is 53'>Is 53</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:26'>Da 9:26</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 13:7'>Zec 13:7</a> . <a ref='Luke 18:32'>18:32</a> <b>delivered over to the Gentiles.</b> Each prophecy of His death (cf. <a ref='Luke 9:22'>9:22</a> , <a ref='Luke 9:44'>44</a> ; <a ref='Luke 12:50'>12:50</a> ; <a ref='Luke 13:32–33'>13:32–33</a> ; <a ref='Luke 17:25'>17:25</a> ) was more explicit than the last.

The reason may have been that they were enamored with other ideas about the Messiah and how His earthly rule would operate (cf. <a ref='Matthew 16:22'>Mt 16:22</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 17:10'>17:10</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:6'>Ac 1:6</a> ). <a ref='Luke 18:35'>18:35</a> <b>Jericho.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Mark 10:46'>Mk 10:46</a> .</i> <b>blind man.</b> There were actually two blind men.

Jericho alone was a prosperous trading center, so it is certain that Zaccheus was a wealthy man. It is striking to note that only a chapter earlier, Luke recorded the account of the rich young ruler, and Jesus’ statement about “how hard it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God” ( <a ref='Luke 18:24'>18:24</a> ). Here Jesus demonstrates that with God, nothing is impossible (cf. <a ref='Luke 18:27'>18:27</a> ). <a ref='Luke 19:3'>19:3</a> <b>the crowd.</b> Christ was probably traveling with a large entourage of pilgrims to the Passover in Jerusalem. But “the crowd” apparently refers to people in Jericho who lined the street to see Him pass through. They had undoubtedly heard about the recent raising of Lazarus in Bethany, less than 15 mi. away ( <a ref='Jn 11'>Jn 11</a> ). That, combined with His fame as a healer and teacher, stirred the entire city when word arrived that He was coming. <a ref='Luke 19:4'>19:4</a> <b>sycamore tree.</b> A sturdy tree with low, spreading branches. A small person could get out on a limb and hang over the road. This was an undignified position for someone of Zaccheus’ rank, but he was desperate to see Christ. <a ref='Luke 19:5'>19:5</a> <b>I must stay at your house.</b> This was worded as a mandate, not a request. It is the only place in all the Gospels where Jesus invited Himself to be someone’s guest (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 65:1'>Is 65:1</a> ). <a ref='Luke 19:6'>19:6</a> <b>gladly.</b> Such a despicable sinner as a typical tax collector ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 5:46'>Mt 5:46</a></i> ) might have been distressed at the prospect of a visit from the perfect, sinless Son of God. But Zaccheus’ heart was prepared. <a ref='Luke 19:7'>19:7</a> <b>they all</b> began to <b>grumble.</b> Both the religious elite and the common people hated Zaccheus. They did not understand, and in their blind pride refused to see, what possible righteous purpose Jesus had in visiting such a notorious sinner. But He had come to seek and to save the lost (v. <a ref='Luke 19:10'>10</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 15:2'>15:2</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 19:8'>19:8</a> <b>I will give back four times as much.</b> Zaccheus’ willingness to make restitution was proof that his conversion was genuine. It was the fruit, not the condition, of his salvation. The law required a penalty of one-fifth as restitution for money acquired by fraud ( <a ref='Leviticus 6:5'>Lv 6:5</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 5:6–7'>Nu 5:6–7</a> ), so Zaccheus was doing more than was required. The law required 4-fold restitution only when an animal was stolen and killed ( <a ref='Exodus 22:1'>Ex 22:1</a> ). If the animal was found alive, only two-fold restitution was required ( <a ref='Exodus 22:4'>Ex 22:4</a> ). But Zaccheus judged his own crime severely, acknowledging that he was as guilty as the lowest common robber. Since much of his wealth had probably been acquired fraudulently, this was a costly commitment. On top of that, he gave half his goods to the poor. But Zaccheus had just found incomprehensible spiritual riches and did not mind the loss of material wealth ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Luke 14:28'>14:28</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 13:44–46'>Mt 13:44–46</a></i> ). He stands in stark contrast with the rich young ruler in <a ref='Luke 18:18–24'>18:18–24</a> . <a ref='Luke 19:9'>19:9</a> <b>a son of Abraham.</b> A Jew by race for whom Christ came as Savior (cf. <a ref='Matthew 1:21'>Mt 1:21</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 10:6'>10:6</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 15:24'>15:24</a> ; <a ref='John 4:22'>Jn 4:22</a> ). <a ref='Luke 19:10'>19:10</a> <b>the Son of Man.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 8:20'>Mt 8:20</a> .</i> <b>to seek and to save the lost.</b> The main theme of Luke’s Gospel.

The entire Herodian dynasty was dependent on Rome for ruling power, and Herod the Great himself had gone to Rome to be given his kingdom. This parable illustrates Christ, who would soon depart to receive His kingdom, and will one day return to rule. It is similar to the parable of the talents ( <a ref='Matthew 25:14–30'>Mt 25:14–30</a> ) but there are significant differences ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 19:13'>13</a></i> ). That parable was told during the Olivet Discourse ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 24:1–25:46'>Mt 24:1—25:46</a></i> ); this one was told on the road from Jericho up to Jerusalem (cf. v. <a ref='Luke 19:28'>28</a> ). <a ref='Luke 19:13'>19:13</a> <b>minas.</b> A Greek measure of money ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 15:8'>15:8</a></i> ), equal to slightly more than 3 months’ salary. The mina was one-sixtieth of a talent, meaning that the 10 servants in this parable had been given a considerably smaller sum to account for than any of the 3 servants in the parable of the talents ( <a ref='Matthew 25:14–30'>Mt 25:14–30</a> ). <a ref='Luke 19:14'>19:14</a> <b>sent a delegation after him.</b> This was precisely what had happened to Archelaus ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 2:22'>Mt 2:22</a></i> ), son of Herod the Great, when he went to Rome to be made tetrarch of Judea. A delegation of Jews traveled to Rome with a protest to Caesar Augustus ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 2:1'>2:1</a></i> ). He refused their complaint and made Archelaus king anyway. Archelaus subsequently built his palace in Jericho, not far from where Jesus told this parable. Archelaus’ rule was so inept and despotic that Rome quickly replaced him with a succession of procurators, of whom Pontius Pilate was the fifth. With this parable Jesus warned that the Jews were about to do the same thing, in a spiritual sense, to their true Messiah. <a ref='Luke 19:15–27'>19:15–27</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 25:14–30'>Mt 25:14–30</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 19:15'>19:15</a> <b>when he returned.</b> This pictured Christ’s return to earth.

Note also that the rewards were apportioned according to the servants’ diligence: the one who gained 10 minas was given 10 cities, the one who gained 5 minas, 5 cities (v. <a ref='Luke 19:19'>19</a> ), and so on. <a ref='Luke 19:21'>19:21</a> <b>I was afraid of you.</b> A craven fear, not borne out of love or reverence, but tainted with contempt for the master ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 25:24'>Mt 25:24</a></i> ).

However, even the knowledge he claimed to have was enough to condemn him. Thus will it be with the wicked in the day of judgment. <a ref='Luke 19:26'>19:26</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 25:29'>Mt 25:29</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 19:27'>19:27</a> <b>these enemies of mine.</b> These illustrated the Jews who actively opposed him. <b>slay them in my presence.</b> This spoke of harsh, violent judgment and may be a reference to the destruction of Jerusalem ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 24:2'>Mt 24:2</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 19:28'>19:28</a> <b>up to Jerusalem.</b> The road from Jericho to Jerusalem was a steep ascent, rising some 3,300 feet in about 17 miles.

Cf. also the words of John the Baptist in <a ref='Matthew 3:9'>Mt 3:9</a> ; note the fulfillment of Jesus’ words in <a ref='Matthew 27:51'>Mt 27:51</a> . <a ref='Luke 19:41–42'>19:41–42</a> Only Luke recorded the weeping of Jesus over the city of Jerusalem. Christ grieved over Jerusalem on at least two other occasions ( <a ref='Luke 13:34'>13:34</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 23:37'>Mt 23:37</a> ). The timing of this lament may seem incongruous with the triumphal entry, but it reveals that Jesus knew the true superficiality of the peoples’ hearts, and His mood was anything but giddy as He rode into the city. The same crowd would soon cry for His death ( <a ref='Luke 23:21'>23:21</a> ). <a ref='Luke 19:43'>19:43</a> <b>surround you and hem you in.</b> Cf. <a ref='Luke 21:20'>21:20</a> . This is precisely the method used by Titus when he laid siege to Jerusalem in AD 70. He surrounded the city on Apr. 9, cutting off all supplies, and trapping thousands of people who had been in Jerusalem for the Passover and Feast of Unleavened Bread (just completed). The Romans systematically built embankments around the city, gradually starving the city’s inhabitants. The Romans held the city in this manner through the summer, defeating various sections of the city one by one. The final overthrow of the city occurred in early Sept. <a ref='Luke 19:44'>19:44</a> <b>they will level you.</b> This was literally fulfilled. The Romans utterly demolished the city, temple, residences, and people. Men, women, and children were brutally slaughtered by the tens of thousands. The few survivors were carried off to become victims of the Roman circus games and gladiatorial bouts. <b>because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.</b> I.e., Jerusalem’s utter destruction was divine judgment for their failure to recognize and embrace their Messiah when He visited them (cf. <a ref='Luke 20:13–16'>20:13–16</a> ; <a ref='John 1:10–11'>Jn 1:10–11</a> ). <a ref='Luke 19:45–46'>19:45–46</a> This was the second time Jesus had driven the sellers out of the temple, and is a different incident from the one described in <a ref='John 2:14–16'>Jn 2:14–16</a> . He quotes from <a ref='Isaiah 56:7'>Is 56:7</a> . <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 21:12'>Mt 21:12</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 19:47'>19:47</a> <b>chief priests.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 2:4'>Mt 2:4</a> .</i> The rulers of the temple. <b>scribes.</b> Mostly Pharisees, experts in the law and traditions. <b>leading men among the people.</b> Prominent Jewish laymen with influence in temple affairs. By bringing His ministry to the temple, Christ had walked into the very heart of the opposition against Him. <b>trying to destroy Him.</b> I.e., kill Him (cf. <a ref='Luke 22:2'>22:2</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 26:3–4'>Mt 26:3–4</a> ; <a ref='John 5:16–18'>Jn 5:16–18</a> ; <a ref='John 7:1'>7:1</a> , <a ref='John 7:19'>19</a> , <a ref='John 7:25'>25</a> ). <a ref='Luke 20:1'>20:1</a> <b>one of the days.</b> Probably Wednesday of Passion Week. The triumphal entry was on Monday, and the cleansing of the temple on Tuesday. The events in this chapter best fit Wednesday in the chronology of that week. This chapter features a series of carefully coordinated attacks on Christ by the Jewish leaders. <b>chief priests … scribes … elders.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 19:47'>19:47</a> .</i> Each of these groups played a unique role in the various attacks that follow. Each was also represented in the Sanhedrin, the Jewish council ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 26:59'>Mt 26:59</a></i> )—suggesting that the council had met to orchestrate the attack against Jesus. Their attacks came in the form of a series of questions designed to entrap Him ( <i>see notes on vv. <a ref='Luke 20:2'>2</a> , <a ref='Luke 20:22'>22</a> , <a ref='Luke 20:33'>33</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 20:2–8'>20:2–8</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 21:23'>Mt 21:23</a> , <a ref='Matthew 21:25'>25</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 20:2'>20:2</a> This was the first in a series of questions designed to entrap Jesus. This question was raised by the chief priests, scribes, and elders—evidently representatives of the Sanhedrin. <i>See notes on vv. <a ref='Luke 20:22'>22</a> , <a ref='Luke 20:33'>33</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 20:5'>20:5</a> <b>Why did you not believe him?</b> John had clearly testified that Jesus was the Messiah. If John was a prophet whose words were true, they ought to believe his testimony about Christ. On the other hand, it would have been political folly for the Pharisees to attack the legitimacy of John the Baptist or deny his authority as a prophet of God. John was enormously popular with the people, and a martyr at the hands of the despised Herod. For the Pharisees to question John’s authority was to attack a national hero, and they knew better than that. So they pleaded ignorance (v. <a ref='Luke 20:7'>7</a> ). <a ref='Luke 20:8'>20:8</a> <b>Neither will I tell you.</b> Jesus exposed the hypocrisy of the question, unmasking their evil motives.

Satan evidently gained direct control over Judas on two occasions—once just before Judas arranged his betrayal with the chief priests, and again during the Last Supper ( <a ref='John 13:27'>Jn 13:27</a> ), immediately before the betrayal was actually carried out. <a ref='Luke 22:4'>22:4</a> <b>officers.</b> I.e., the temple guard, a security force consisting of Levites. <a ref='Luke 22:5'>22:5</a> <b>agreed to give him money.</b> <a ref='Matthew 26:15'>Matthew 26:15</a> says 30 pieces of silver, the price of a slave ( <a ref='Exodus 21:32'>Ex 21:32</a> ). <a ref='Luke 22:7'>22:7</a> <b>day of Unleavened Bread.</b> I.e., the first day of the feast season ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 26:17'>Mt 26:17</a></i> ). The people from Galilee celebrated the Passover on Thursday evening (see Introduction to John: Interpretive Challenges ), so the lambs were killed in the afternoon of that day. The disciples and Jesus ate the Passover meal that evening, after sundown (when Passover officially began). Judeans would follow this same sequence one day later on Friday. <a ref='Luke 22:8'>22:8</a> <b>Peter and John.</b> Identified only by Luke. <b>Go and prepare.</b> This was no small task. They had to take the paschal lamb to be sacrificed, and make preparations for a meal for 13 (v. <a ref='Luke 22:14'>14</a> ). But preliminary arrangements for the meal had apparently been made personally by Jesus Himself, and the owner of the upper room was taking care of many of those details for them. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 26:18'>Mt 26:18</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 22:10'>22:10</a> <b>a man … carrying … water.</b> Probably part of his work to prepare for the meal. Normally carrying water was woman’s work, so a man carrying a pitcher would stand out. It is unlikely that the water pitcher was any sort of prearranged signal. Christ’s knowledge of what the man would be doing at the precise moment the disciples arrived appears to be a manifestation of His divine omniscience. <a ref='Luke 22:12'>22:12</a> <b>a large, furnished upper room.</b> One of many such rooms for rent in Jerusalem that were maintained for the express purpose of providing pilgrims a place to celebrate feasts. The furnishings undoubtedly included everything necessary to prepare and serve a meal. <a ref='Luke 22:14'>22:14</a> <b>the hour had come.</b> I.e., sundown, marking the official beginning of Passover ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 22:7'>7</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 22:15'>22:15</a> <b>earnestly desired.</b> Cf. <a ref='John 13:1'>Jn 13:1</a> . Jesus wanted to prepare them for what was coming. <a ref='Luke 22:16'>22:16</a> <b>fulfilled.</b> Christ’s death on the following day fulfilled the symbolism of the Passover meal. Passover was both a memorial of the deliverance from Egypt, and a prophetic type of the sacrifice of Christ. <a ref='Luke 22:17'>22:17</a> <b>when He had taken a cup.</b> Luke mentions two cups (cf. v. <a ref='Luke 22:20'>20</a> ). The Passover seder involved the sharing of 4 cups of diluted red wine. This cup was the first of the 4 (the cup of thanksgiving) and was preliminary to the institution of the Lord’s Supper ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:16'>1Co 10:16</a></i> ). It represented the end of His time of eating and drinking with the disciples, particularly partaking of the Passover (v. <a ref='Luke 22:18'>18</a> ; cf. <a ref='Luke 5:34–35'>5:34–35</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 9:15'>Mt 9:15</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 26:29'>26:29</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Mark 14:25'>Mk 14:25</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 22:19'>22:19</a> <b>This is My body.</b> I.e., it represented His body (cf. the words of <a ref='Luke 8:11'>8:11</a> , “the seed is the word of God”—and also v. <a ref='Luke 22:20'>20</a> ). Such metaphorical language was a typical Hebraism. No eucharistic miracle of transubstantiation was implied, nor could the disciples have missed the symbolic intent of His statement, for His actual body—yet unbroken—was before their very eyes. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 26:26'>Mt 26:26</a> .</i> <b>Do this.</b> Thus He established the observance as an ordinance for worship ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Corinthians 11:23–26'>1Co 11:23–26</a></i> ). <b>remembrance of Me.</b> Passover had looked forward to the sacrifice of Christ; He transformed the seder into an altogether different ceremony, which looks back in remembrance at His atoning death. <a ref='Luke 22:20'>22:20</a> took <b>the cup.</b> This is the third (the cup of blessing) of the 4 cups in the Passover celebration ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:16'>1Co 10:16</a></i> ). <b>after they had eaten.</b> Cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 11:25'>1Co 11:25</a> . These two verses are virtually identical in form. Paul stated that he had received his information about this event from the Lord Himself ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 11:23'>1Co 11:23</a> ). <b>This cup … is the new covenant.</b> Clearly, the cup only represented the New Covenant ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 22:19'>19</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 22:21'>22:21</a> <b>the hand … betraying Me.</b> Luke recounted the details of the Lord’s Supper topically, not chronologically (see Introduction: Background and Setting ; see <i>note on <a ref='Luke 1:3'>1:3</a></i> ). Matthew and Mark placed Jesus’ warning about the betrayer prior to the giving of the bread and cup; Luke put it afterward. Only <a ref='John 13:30'>Jn 13:30</a> records Judas’ departure, but John says nothing about the bread and cup. So it is difficult to tell by comparison whether Judas left before or after the institution of the Lord’s Supper. But Luke’s words here seem to imply that Judas actually shared in that event. If so, his presence at that time makes his hypocrisy and crime all the more despicable (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 11:27–30'>1Co 11:27–30</a> ). <a ref='Luke 22:22'>22:22</a> <b>as it has been determined.</b> Every detail of the crucifixion of Christ was under the sovereign control of God and in accord with His eternal purposes. Cf. <a ref='Acts 2:23'>Ac 2:23</a> ; <a ref='Acts 4:26–28'>4:26–28</a> . <b>but woe.</b> The fact that Judas’ betrayal was part of God’s plan does not free him from the guilt of a crime he entered into willfully. God’s sovereignty is never a legitimate excuse for human guilt. <a ref='Luke 22:24'>22:24</a> <b>a dispute.</b> Cf. <a ref='Luke 9:46'>9:46</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 20:20–24'>Mt 20:20–24</a> . This dispute may have prompted the episode where Christ washed their feet ( <a ref='John 13:1–20'>Jn 13:1–20</a> ). It reveals how large an issue this was in the minds of the disciples, and how far they were from grasping all that He had taught them. <a ref='Luke 22:25'>22:25</a> <b>Benefactors.</b> Cf. <a ref='Matthew 20:25'>Mt 20:25</a> . This title was used by the heathen rulers of both Egypt and Syria, though it was rarely a fitting description. The intent was to portray themselves as champions of their people, but it had a very condescending ring to it—especially when so many “benefactors” were actually ruthless tyrants. <a ref='Luke 22:26'>22:26</a> <b>leader like the servant.</b> Cf. <a ref='Matthew 20:26–28'>Mt 20:26–28</a> . This is an apparent reference to the washing of their feet ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 22:24'>24</a></i> ). Christ Himself had modeled such servitude throughout His ministry (v. <a ref='Luke 22:27'>27</a> ; cf. <a ref='Philippians 2:5–8'>Php 2:5–8</a> ). <a ref='Luke 22:28'>22:28</a> <b>My trials.</b> Christ’s entire life and ministry were filled with temptations ( <a ref='Luke 4:1–13'>4:1–13</a> ); hardships ( <a ref='Luke 9:58'>9:58</a> ); sorrows ( <a ref='Luke 19:41'>19:41</a> ); and agonies (v. <a ref='Luke 22:44'>44</a> )—not to mention the sufferings of the cross which He knew were yet to come. <a ref='Luke 22:29'>22:29</a> <b>I grant you a kingdom.</b> Christ confirmed the disciples’ expectation of an earthly kingdom yet to come. It would not come in the timing or the manner that they hoped, but He affirmed the promise that such a kingdom would indeed be established, and that they would have a principal role in it (v. <a ref='Luke 22:30'>30</a> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 19:28'>Mt 19:28</a> ). <a ref='Luke 22:30'>22:30</a> <b>judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</b> The language identifies this as a millennial promise. <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 20:4'>Rev 20:4</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 22:31'>22:31</a> <b>Simon, Simon.</b> The repetition of the name (cf. <a ref='Luke 10:41'>10:41</a> ; <a ref='Acts 9:4'>Ac 9:4</a> ) implied an earnest and somber tone of warning. Christ Himself had given Simon the name Peter ( <a ref='Luke 6:14'>6:14</a> ), but here He reverted to his old name, perhaps to intensify His rebuke about Peter’s fleshly overconfidence. The context also suggests that Peter may have been one of the more vocal participants in the dispute of v. <a ref='Luke 22:24'>24</a> . <b>Satan has demanded.</b> Though addressed specifically to Peter, this warning embraced the other disciples as well. <b>sift … you like wheat.</b> The imagery is apt. It suggests that such trials, though unsettling and undesirable, have a necessary refining effect. <a ref='Luke 22:32'>22:32</a> <b>I have prayed … for you.</b> The pronoun “you” is singular ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 22:31'>31</a></i> ). Although it is clear that Jesus prayed for all of them ( <a ref='John 17:6–19'>Jn 17:6–19</a> ), He personally assured Peter of His prayers and of Peter’s ultimate victory, even encouraging Peter to be an encourager to the others. <b>that your faith may not fail.</b> Peter himself failed miserably, but his faith was never overthrown (cf. <a ref='John 21:18–19'>Jn 21:18–19</a> ). <a ref='Luke 22:34'>22:34</a> <b>you have denied.</b> This prediction of Peter’s denial evidently took place in the upper room (cf. <a ref='John 13:38'>Jn 13:38</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 26:34'>Matthew 26:34</a> and <a ref='Mark 14:30'>Mark 14:30</a> record a second, nearly identical incident, which took place on the Mt. of Olives on the way to Gethsemane (cf. <a ref='Matthew 26:30'>Mt 26:30</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:26'>Mk 14:26</a> ). <a ref='Luke 22:35'>22:35</a> <b>When I sent you.</b> Cf. <a ref='Luke 9:3'>9:3</a> ; <a ref='Luke 10:4'>10:4</a> . <a ref='Luke 22:36'>22:36</a> <b>But now.</b> When Christ sent them out before, He had sovereignly arranged for their needs to be met. Henceforth they were to use normal means to provide for their own support and protection. The money bag, knapsack, and sword were figurative expressions for such means (the sword being emblematic of protection, not aggression). But they mistakenly took His words literally (v. <a ref='Luke 22:38'>38</a> ). <a ref='Luke 22:37'>22:37</a> Quoted from <a ref='Isaiah 53:12'>Is 53:12</a> . <a ref='Luke 22:38'>22:38</a> <b>two swords.</b> These were short, daggerlike instruments—more like knives than swords.

This does not imply that there was any conflict between the will of the Father and the will of the Son. It was a perfectly normal expression of His humanity that He shrank from the cup of divine wrath ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 26:39'>Mt 26:39</a></i> ). But even though the cup was abhorrent to Him, He willingly took it, because it was the will of the Father. In this prayer He was consciously, deliberately, and voluntarily subjugating all His human desires to the Father’s perfect will. Thus there was neither conflict between Father and Son, nor between the deity of Christ and His human desires. <a ref='Luke 22:43–44'>22:43–44</a> The facts in these verses are related only by Luke, the physician. <a ref='Luke 22:44'>22:44</a> <b>like drops of blood.</b> This suggests a dangerous condition known as <i>hematidrosis</i> , the effusion of blood in one’s perspiration.

Thus they gratified their immediate desire for sleep, rather than staying awake to pray for strength, as Christ had commanded them (v. <a ref='Luke 22:40'>40</a> ). All the reasons for their subsequent failure are found in their behavior in the garden. <a ref='Luke 22:46'>22:46</a> <b>Rise up and pray.</b> A tender appeal to the disciples, who in their weakness were disobeying Him at a critical moment. He may have been summoning them to a standing posture, to help overcome their drowsiness. <a ref='Matthew 26:43'>Matthew 26:43</a> and <a ref='Mark 14:40'>Mark 14:40</a> reveal that He again found them sleeping at least one more time. <a ref='Luke 22:47'>22:47</a> <b>a crowd.</b> These were heavily armed representatives of the Sanhedrin ( <a ref='Matthew 26:47'>Mt 26:47</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:43'>Mk 14:43</a> ), accompanied by a Roman cohort with lanterns, torches, and weapons ( <a ref='John 18:3'>Jn 18:3</a> ). <b>kiss.</b> A typical greeting, but this was the prearranged signal by which Judas would identify Christ for the soldiers (cf. <a ref='Matthew 26:48–49'>Mt 26:48–49</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Mark 14:44'>Mk 14:44</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 22:50'>22:50</a> <b>cut off his right ear.</b> All 4 Gospels record this incident. Only John reveals that the swordsman was Peter and the victim was named Malchus ( <a ref='John 18:10'>Jn 18:10</a> ). And only Luke, the physician, records the subsequent healing (v. <a ref='Luke 22:51'>51</a> ). <a ref='Luke 22:51'>22:51</a> <b>touched his ear and healed him.</b> This is the only instance in all of Scripture where Christ healed a flesh wound. The miracle is also unique in that Christ healed an enemy, unasked, and without any evidence of faith in the recipient. It is also remarkable that such a dramatic miracle had no effect whatsoever on the hearts of those men. Neither had the explosive power of Jesus’ words, which knocked them to the ground ( <a ref='John 18:6'>Jn 18:6</a> ). They carried on with the arrest as if nothing peculiar had happened (v. <a ref='Luke 22:54'>54</a> ). <a ref='Luke 22:53'>22:53</a> <b>this hour … darkness are yours.</b> I.e., nighttime, the hour of darkness. They had not the courage to confront Jesus in the presence of the crowds at the temple, where He had openly taught each day. Their skulking tactics betrayed the truth about their hearts. Nighttime was a fitting hour for the servants of the power of darkness (Satan) to be afoot (cf. <a ref='John 3:20–21'>Jn 3:20–21</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:8'>Eph 5:8</a> , <a ref='Ephesians 5:12–15'>12–15</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:5–7'>1Th 5:5–7</a> ). <a ref='Luke 22:54'>22:54</a> <b>house of the high priest.</b> I.e., Caiaphas’ house. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 26:57'>Mt 26:57</a> .</i> <b>Peter was following at a distance.</b> All 4 Gospels record this fact. John indicates that another disciple—presumably himself—also followed ( <a ref='John 18:15'>Jn 18:15</a> ). <a ref='Luke 22:56'>22:56</a> <b>a servant-girl.</b> All 4 Gospels mention her. She appears to have been the doorkeeper of Annas’ house (cf. <a ref='Matthew 26:69'>Mt 26:69</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:66'>Mk 14:66</a> ; <a ref='John 18:17'>Jn 18:17</a> ). <a ref='Luke 22:57'>22:57</a> <b>But he denied</b> it <b>.</b> <a ref='John 18:13–18'>John 18:13–18</a> says this first denial took place while Jesus was being examined by Annas, father-in-law to Caiaphas ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 3:2'>3:2</a></i> ). Both accounts mention a fire in the courtyard (v. <a ref='Luke 22:55'>55</a> ; <a ref='John 18:18'>Jn 18:18</a> ) so it may be that the houses of Annas and Caiaphas shared a common courtyard. Only John mentions the examination by Annas, so the other Gospels describe Peter’s 3-fold denial as an incident that took place in the porch and courtyard of Caiaphas’ house. <a ref='Luke 22:58'>22:58</a> <b>another saw him.</b> “Another” is a masculine pronoun in the Greek, indicating a man. <a ref='Mark 14:69'>Mark 14:69</a> says this second challenge to Peter came from the same servant-girl who first recognized him (v. <a ref='Luke 22:56'>56</a> ). The supposed discrepancy is easily reconciled when it is remembered that Peter was among several bystanders, and many of them questioned him at once ( <a ref='Matthew 26:73'>Mt 26:73</a> ). He responded with his second denial. <a ref='Luke 22:59'>22:59</a> <b>he … is a Galilean.</b> They knew because of his accent ( <a ref='Matthew 26:73'>Mt 26:73</a> ). <a ref='Luke 22:61'>22:61</a> <b>the Lord turned and looked at Peter.</b> Luke alone records that Jesus made eye contact with Peter. The verb used suggests an intent, fixed look. The fact that He could see Peter suggests that the men holding Jesus had already brought Him into the courtyard to beat Him (v. <a ref='Luke 22:63'>63</a> ). <b>Peter remembered.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 26:75'>Mt 26:75</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 22:63'>22:63</a> <b>mocking Him while they beat Him.</b> Luke includes no details about Caiaphas’ first interrogation of Jesus, recorded in <a ref='Matthew 26:59–68'>Mt 26:59–68</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:55–65'>Mk 14:55–65</a> . The beating described here evidently took place after that first examination, before the Sanhedrin could assemble for its official hearing (v. <a ref='Luke 22:66'>66</a> ). <a ref='Luke 22:66'>22:66</a> <b>as the day came.</b> Criminal trials were not deemed legal if held at night, so the Sanhedrin dutifully waited until daybreak to render the verdict they had already agreed on anyway (cf. <a ref='Matthew 26:66'>Mt 26:66</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:64'>Mk 14:64</a> ). <a ref='Luke 22:67'>22:67</a> <b>If You are the Christ.</b> The Sanhedrin subjected Him to the same set of questions He had been asked in the nighttime trial, and the answers He gave were substantially the same (cf. vv. <a ref='Luke 22:67–71'>67–71</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 26:63–66'>Mt 26:63–66</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:61–64'>Mk 14:61–64</a> ). <a ref='Luke 23:1'>23:1</a> <b>their whole assembly.</b> I.e., the entire Sanhedrin, some 70 men.

At one time Herod had apparently threatened to kill Jesus ( <a ref='Luke 13:31–33'>13:31–33</a> ), but with Christ in Judea rather than Galilee and Perea (where Herod ruled), the king’s concern seems to have been nothing more than an eager curiosity. <a ref='Luke 23:9'>23:9</a> <b>answered him nothing.</b> It is significant that in all Jesus’ various interrogations, Herod was the only one to whom He refused to speak. Cf. <a ref='Matthew 7:6'>Mt 7:6</a> . Herod had summarily rejected the truth when he heard it from John the Baptist, so it would have been pointless for Jesus to answer him.

His desire to please the Jews for political reasons (to save himself from Rome’s displeasure) ultimately overcame his desire to set Jesus free (cf. v. <a ref='Luke 23:20'>20</a> ). <a ref='John 18:39–19:16'>John 18:39—19:16</a> gives a much more detailed account of Pilate’s decision to hand Jesus over. <a ref='Luke 23:26'>23:26</a> <b>Simon of Cyrene.</b> All 3 Synoptic Gospels mention Simon. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 27:32'>Mt 27:32</a> ; <a ref='Mark 15:21'>Mk 15:21</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 23:28'>23:28</a> <b>Daughters of Jerusalem.</b> There is nothing to suggest that these women were Christ’s disciples.

They were blind to the light of divine truth, “for if they had understood it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory” ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:8'>1Co 2:8</a> ). Still, their ignorance certainly did not mean that they deserved forgiveness; rather, their spiritual blindness itself was a manifestation of their guilt ( <a ref='John 3:19'>Jn 3:19</a> ).

Both Luke and John ( <a ref='Luke 19:20'>19:20</a> ) said that the inscription was written in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, so the varying reports in the Gospels may simply reflect variant ways the inscription was translated on the placard itself. It is even more likely that all 4 evangelists simply reported the substance of the inscription elliptically, with each one omitting different parts of the full inscription. All 4 concurred with Mark that the inscription said THE KING OF THE JEWS ( <a ref='Matthew 27:37'>Mt 27:37</a> ; <a ref='Mark 15:26'>Mk 15:26</a> ; <a ref='John 19:19'>Jn 19:19</a> ).

Even the thief testified of His innocence. <a ref='Luke 23:42'>23:42</a> <b>Jesus, remember me.</b> The penitent thief’s prayer reflected his belief that the soul lives on after death; that Christ had a right to rule over a kingdom of the souls of men; and that He would soon enter that kingdom despite His impending death. His request to be remembered was a plea for mercy, which also reveals that the thief understood he had no hope but divine grace, and that the dispensing of that grace lay in Jesus’ power. All of this demonstrates true faith on the part of the dying thief, and Christ graciously affirmed the man’s salvation (v. <a ref='Luke 23:43'>43</a> ). <a ref='Luke 23:43'>23:43</a> <b>Paradise.</b> The only other places this word is used in the NT are <a ref='2 Corinthians 12:4'>2Co 12:4</a> and <a ref='Revelation 2:7'>Rev 2:7</a> .

These women, from Galilee, were probably unfamiliar with Joseph and Nicodemus, who were Judeans. After all, both men were associated with the Jewish leaders who orchestrated the conspiracy against Jesus (v. <a ref='Luke 23:50'>50</a> ; <a ref='John 3:1'>Jn 3:1</a> ). So the women were determined to prepare Jesus’ body for burial themselves. So they returned (i.e., went to their homes) to prepare their own spices and perfumes (v. <a ref='Luke 23:56'>56</a> ). They had to have Jesus’ body placed in the tomb before sunset, when the Sabbath began, so they were not able to finish preparing the body. <a ref='Mark 16:1'>Mark 16:1</a> says they purchased more spices “when the Sabbath passed,” i.e., after sundown Saturday.

The angel who spoke reminded them of Jesus’ promises (vv. <a ref='Luke 24:6–8'>6–8</a> ), then sent them to find Peter and the disciples to report that Jesus was risen ( <a ref='Matthew 28:7–8'>Mt 28:7–8</a> ; <a ref='Mark 16:7–8'>Mk 16:7–8</a> ). The women did as they were told (vv. <a ref='Luke 24:9–11'>9–11</a> ). The disciples were skeptical at first (v. <a ref='Luke 24:11'>11</a> ), but ran to where the tomb was, John arriving first ( <a ref='John 20:4'>Jn 20:4</a> ), but Peter actually entering the tomb first ( <a ref='John 20:6'>Jn 20:6</a> ). They saw the linen wrappings intact but empty, proof that Jesus was risen (v. <a ref='Luke 24:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='John 20:6–8'>Jn 20:6–8</a> ). They left immediately (v. <a ref='Luke 24:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='John 20:10'>Jn 20:10</a> ). Meanwhile, Mary Magdalene returned to the tomb, and was standing outside weeping when Christ suddenly appeared to her ( <a ref='John 20:11–18'>Jn 20:11–18</a> ). That was His first appearance ( <a ref='Mark 16:9'>Mk 16:9</a> ). Sometime soon after that, He met the other women on the road and appeared to them as well ( <a ref='Matthew 28:9–10'>Mt 28:9–10</a> ). Later that day He appeared to two of the disciples on the road to Emmaus (vv. <a ref='Luke 24:13–32'>13–32</a> ), and to Peter (v. <a ref='Luke 24:34'>34</a> ). For a chronological listing of all His post-resurrection appearances, <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 24:34'>34</a></i> . <a ref='Luke 24:6'>24:6</a> <b>how He spoke to you … in Galilee.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Luke 9:22'>9:22</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:31–33'>18:31–33</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 24:9'>24:9</a> <b>all the rest.</b> I.e., other disciples, mostly from Galilee, who were in Jerusalem for the Passover. <a ref='Luke 24:10'>24:10</a> <b>Mary Magdalene.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 8:2'>8:2</a> .</i> She was the first to see Jesus alive ( <a ref='Mark 16:9'>Mk 16:9</a> ; <a ref='John 20:11–18'>Jn 20:11–18</a> ). <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 24:4'>4</a> .</i> <b>Joanna.</b> Her husband was Herod’s steward. <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 8:3'>8:3</a> .</i> <b>Mary the</b> mother <b>of James.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 27:56'>Mt 27:56</a> .</i> <b>the rest of the women.</b> They are never explicitly identified (cf. <a ref='Luke 23:49'>23:49</a> , <a ref='Luke 23:55'>55</a> ). <a ref='Luke 24:11'>24:11</a> <b>nonsense.</b> I.e., idle tales. <a ref='Luke 24:12'>24:12</a> <b>Peter … ran.</b> John ran with Peter, but reached the tomb first ( <a ref='John 20:4'>Jn 20:4</a> ). <b>linen wrappings.</b> I.e., the empty shell of wrappings that had contained the body. <a ref='Luke 24:13'>24:13</a> <b>two of them.</b> These evidently were not any of the 11 disciples. According to v. <a ref='Luke 24:18'>18</a> , one was named Cleopas. <b>Emmaus.</b> Mentioned nowhere else in Scripture. Its exact location is not known, but tradition says it is a town known as Kubeibeh, 7 mi. northwest of Jerusalem. <a ref='Luke 24:16'>24:16</a> <b>their eyes were prevented.</b> I.e., they were kept by God from recognizing Him. <a ref='Luke 24:18'>24:18</a> <b>Are You the only one visiting Jerusalem.</b> The crucifixion of Jesus was already such a well-known event around Jerusalem that they were shocked that He seemed not to know about it. <a ref='Luke 24:21'>24:21</a> <b>But we were hoping.</b> They had been looking for an immediate earthly kingdom. With Jesus crucified, they were probably struggling with doubt about whether He was the Messiah who would reign. But they still regarded Him as a true prophet (v. <a ref='Luke 24:19'>19</a> ). <b>the third day.</b> There may have been a glimmer of hope in these words. They had heard rumors of His resurrection already (vv. <a ref='Luke 24:22–24'>22–24</a> ). Perhaps Cleopas recalled the Lord’s promises of <a ref='Luke 9:22'>9:22</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:33'>18:33</a> . More likely, however, it seems this was his way of expressing surprise that this Stranger did not yet know the news everyone else in Jerusalem had been discussing for the past 3 days. <a ref='Luke 24:24'>24:24</a> <b>Some of those who were with us.</b> I.e., Peter and John ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 24:12'>12</a></i> ). <b>but Him they did not see.</b> This was true. Evidently, Cleopas and his companion had not heard about the appearance to Mary Magdalene ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 24:4'>4</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 24:26'>24:26</a> <b>Was it not necessary…?</b> OT prophecies spoke often of a suffering servant of Jehovah ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 24:27'>27</a></i> ). <a ref='Luke 24:27'>24:27</a> <b>Moses … all the prophets.</b> Verse <a ref='Luke 24:44'>44</a> gives the 3-fold division; this expression is merely a shortened way to say the same thing. <b>in all the Scriptures.</b> In the inscrutable wisdom of divine providence, the substance of Christ’s exposition of the OT messianic prophecies was not recorded. But the gist of what He expounded would have undoubtedly included an explanation of the OT sacrificial system, which was full of types and symbols that spoke of His sufferings and death. He also would have pointed them to the major prophetic passages which spoke of the crucifixion, such as <a ref='Psalms 16:9–11'>Pss 16:9–11</a> ; <a ref='Ps 22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Ps 69'>69</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 52:14–53:12'>Is 52:14—53:12</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 12:10'>Zec 12:10</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 13:7'>13:7</a> . And He would have pointed out the true meaning of passages like <a ref='Genesis 3:15'>Ge 3:15</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 21:6–9'>Nu 21:6–9</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 16:10'>Ps 16:10</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:5–6'>Jer 23:5–6</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:26'>Da 9:26</a> —and a host of other key messianic prophecies, particularly those that spoke of His death and resurrection. <a ref='Luke 24:30'>24:30</a> <b>took the bread.</b> A simple expression, meaning to share a meal (v. <a ref='Luke 24:35'>35</a> ). <a ref='Luke 24:31'>24:31</a> <b>their eyes were opened.</b> I.e., by God. They had been sovereignly kept from recognizing Him until this point (cf. v. <a ref='Luke 24:16'>16</a> ). His resurrection body was glorified, and altered from its previous appearance (see John’s description in <a ref='Revelation 1:13–16'>Rev 1:13–16</a> ), and this surely explains why even Mary did not recognize Him at first (cf. <a ref='John 20:14–16'>Jn 20:14–16</a> ). But in this case, God actively intervened to keep them from recognizing Him until it was time for Him to depart. <b>He vanished from their sight.</b> His resurrection body, though real and tangible ( <a ref='John 20:27'>Jn 20:27</a> )—and even capable of ingesting earthly food (vv. <a ref='Luke 24:42–43'>42–43</a> )—nonetheless possessed certain properties that indicate it was glorified, altered in a mysterious way (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:35–54'>1Co 15:35–54</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:21'>Php 3:21</a> ). Christ could appear and disappear bodily, as seen in this text. His body could pass through solid objects—such as the grave clothes ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 24:12'>12</a></i> ), or the walls and doors of a closed room ( <a ref='John 20:19'>Jn 20:19</a> , <a ref='John 20:26'>26</a> ). He could apparently travel great distances in a moment, for by the time these disciples returned to Jerusalem, Christ had already appeared to Peter (v. <a ref='Luke 24:34'>34</a> ). The fact that He ascended into heaven bodily demonstrated that His resurrection body was already fit for heaven. Yet it was His body, the same one that was missing from the tomb, even retaining identifying features such as the nail-wounds ( <a ref='John 20:25–27'>Jn 20:25–27</a> ). He was no ghost or phantom. <a ref='Luke 24:34'>24:34</a> <b>appeared to Simon.</b> Cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:5–8'>1Co 15:5–8</a> . Scripture describes at least 10 distinct appearances of Christ between the resurrection and ascension. He appeared to: 1) Mary Magdalene at the tomb ( <a ref='Mark 16:9'>Mk 16:9</a> ; <a ref='John 20:11–18'>Jn 20:11–18</a> ); 2) to the women on the road ( <a ref='Matthew 28:9–10'>Mt 28:9–10</a> ); 3) to the disciples on the road to Emmaus (vv. <a ref='Luke 24:13–32'>13–32</a> ); 4) to Peter (v. <a ref='Luke 24:34'>34</a> ); 5) to 10 of the 11 disciples, Thomas being absent (vv. <a ref='Luke 24:36–43'>36–43</a> ; <a ref='Mark 16:14'>Mk 16:14</a> ; <a ref='John 20:19–25'>Jn 20:19–25</a> ); 6) to the 11 disciples (with Thomas present) 8 days later ( <a ref='John 20:26–31'>Jn 20:26–31</a> ); 7) to 7 disciples by the shore of the Sea of Galilee ( <a ref='John 21:1–25'>Jn 21:1–25</a> ); 8) to more than 500 disciples, probably on a mountain in Galilee ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:6'>1Co 15:6</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 28:16'>Mt 28:16</a></i> ); 9) to James ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:7'>1Co 15:7</a> ); and 10) to the apostles when He ascended into heaven ( <a ref='Acts 1:3–11'>Ac 1:3–11</a> ). After His ascension, He appeared to Paul ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:8'>1Co 15:8</a> ). The next time He appears it will be in glory ( <a ref='Matthew 24:30'>Mt 24:30</a> ). <a ref='Luke 24:36'>24:36</a> <b>He Himself stood in their midst.</b> The doors were closed and locked ( <a ref='John 20:19'>Jn 20:19</a> ). <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 24:31'>31</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 24:39'>24:39</a> <b>See My hands and My feet.</b> He was showing them the nail wounds to prove it was really Him. Cf. <a ref='John 20:27'>Jn 20:27</a> . <a ref='Luke 24:41–43'>24:41–43</a> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 24:31'>31</a> .</i> Cf. <a ref='Acts 10:41'>Ac 10:41</a> . <a ref='Luke 24:44'>24:44</a> <b>the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms.</b> I.e., the whole OT. <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 24:27'>27</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 24:45'>24:45</a> <b>opened their minds.</b> He undoubtedly taught them from the OT, as He had on the road to Emmaus ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Luke 24:27'>27</a></i> ). But the gist of the expression also seems to convey a supernatural opening of their minds to receive the truths He unfolded. Whereas their understanding was once dull ( <a ref='Luke 9:45'>9:45</a> ), they finally saw clearly (cf. <a ref='Psalms 119:18'>Ps 119:18</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 29:18–19'>Is 29:18–19</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 3:14–16'>2Co 3:14–16</a> ). <a ref='Luke 24:46–53'>24:46–53</a> This section contains several ideas that are echoed in the opening of Acts, including Christ’s suffering and resurrection (v. <a ref='Luke 24:46'>46</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:3'>Ac 1:3</a> ); the message of repentance and remission of sins (v. <a ref='Luke 24:47'>47</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:38'>Ac 2:38</a> ); the disciples as His witnesses (v. <a ref='Luke 24:48'>48</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:8'>Ac 1:8</a> ); the Promise of the Father (v. <a ref='Luke 24:49'>49</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:4'>Ac 1:4</a> ); tarrying in Jerusalem (v. <a ref='Luke 24:49'>49</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:4'>Ac 1:4</a> ) and the beginning of gospel outreach there (v. <a ref='Luke 24:47'>47</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:8'>Ac 1:8</a> ); power from on high (v. <a ref='Luke 24:49'>49</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:8'>Ac 1:8</a> ); Christ’s ascension (v. <a ref='Luke 24:51'>51</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:9–11'>Ac 1:9–11</a> ); the disciples’ return to Jerusalem (v. <a ref='Luke 24:52'>52</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:12'>Ac 1:12</a> ); and their meeting in the temple (v. <a ref='Luke 24:53'>53</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:46'>Ac 2:46</a> ). <a ref='Luke 24:46'>24:46</a> <b>it is written.</b> I.e., in the OT. <i>See note on v. <a ref='Luke 24:27'>27</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 24:47'>24:47</a> This was the Great Commission (cf. <a ref='Matthew 28:19–20'>Mt 28:19–20</a> ; <a ref='Mark 16:15'>Mk 16:15</a> ). <a ref='Luke 24:49'>24:49</a> <b>the promise of My Father.</b> I.e., the Holy Spirit ( <a ref='John 14:26'>Jn 14:26</a> ; <a ref='John 15:26'>15:26</a> ; cf. <a ref='Joel 2:28–29'>Joel 2:28–29</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:1–4'>Ac 2:1–4</a> ). <a ref='Luke 24:50'>24:50</a> <b>Bethany.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Luke 19:29'>19:29</a> ; <a ref='Mark 11:1'>Mk 11:1</a> .</i> <a ref='Luke 24:51'>24:51</a> <b>carried up into heaven.</b> I.e., visibly.
