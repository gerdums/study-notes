    "content": "The Gospel According to Matthew Title Matthew, meaning “gift of the Lord,” was the other name of Levi ( <a ref='Matthew 9:9'>9:9</a> ), the tax collector who left everything to follow Christ ( <a ref='Luke 5:27–28'>Lk 5:27–28</a> ). Matthew was one of the 12 apostles ( <a ref='Matthew 10:3'>10:3</a> ; <a ref='Mark 3:18'>Mk 3:18</a> ; <a ref='Luke 6:15'>Lk 6:15</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:13'>Ac 1:13</a> ). In his own list of the 12, he explicitly calls himself a “tax collector” ( <a ref='Matthew 10:3'>10:3</a> ). Nowhere else in Scripture is the name Matthew associated with “tax collector”; the other evangelists always employ his former name, Levi, when speaking of his sinful past. This is evidence of humility on Matthew’s part. As with the other 3 Gospels, this work is known by the name of its author. Author and Date The canonicity and Matthean authorship of this Gospel were unchallenged in the early church. Eusebius (ca. AD 265–339) quotes Origen (ca. AD 185–254): Among the four Gospels, which are the only indisputable ones in the Church of God under heaven, I have learned by tradition that the first was written by Matthew, who was once a publican, but afterwards an apostle of Jesus Christ, and it was prepared for the converts from Judaism ( <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> , <a ref='Matthew 6:25'>6:25</a> ). It is clear that this Gospel was written at a relatively early date—prior to the destruction of the temple in AD 70. Some scholars have proposed a date as early as AD 50. For a further discussion of some of the issues related to the authorship and dating of this Gospel, especially “The Synoptic Problem,” see Introduction to Mark: Interpretive Challenges . Background and Setting The Jewish flavor of Matthew’s Gospel is remarkable. This is evident even in the opening genealogy, which Matthew traces back only as far as Abraham. In contrast, Luke, aiming to show Christ as the Redeemer of humanity, goes all the way back to Adam. Matthew’s purpose is somewhat narrower: to demonstrate that Christ is the King and Messiah of Israel. This Gospel quotes more than 60 times from OT prophetic passages, emphasizing how Christ is the fulfillment of all those promises. The probability that Matthew’s audience was predominantly Jewish is further evident from several facts: Matthew usually cites Jewish custom without explaining it, in contrast to the other Gospels (cf. <a ref='Mark 7:3'>Mk 7:3</a> ; <a ref='John 19:40'>Jn 19:40</a> ). He constantly refers to Christ as “the Son of David” ( <a ref='Matthew 1:1'>1:1</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 9:27'>9:27</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 12:23'>12:23</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 15:22'>15:22</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 20:30'>20:30</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 21:9'>21:9</a> , <a ref='Matthew 21:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 22:42'>22:42</a> , <a ref='Matthew 22:45'>45</a> ). Matthew even guards Jewish sensibilities regarding the name of God, referring to “the kingdom of heaven,” where the other evangelists speak of “the kingdom of God.” All the book’s major themes are rooted in the OT and set in light of Israel’s messianic expectations. Matthew’s use of Greek may suggest that he was writing as a Palestinian Jew to Hellenistic Jews elsewhere. He wrote as an eyewitness of many of the events he described, giving firsthand testimony about the words and works of Jesus of Nazareth. His purpose is clear: to demonstrate that Jesus is the Jewish nation’s long-awaited Messiah. His voluminous quoting of the OT is specifically designed to show the tie between the Messiah of promise and the Christ of history. This purpose is never out of focus for Matthew, and he even adduces many incidental details from the OT prophecies as proofs of Jesus’ messianic claims (e.g., <a ref='Matthew 2:17–18'>2:17–18</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 4:13–15'>4:13–15</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 13:35'>13:35</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 21:4–5'>21:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 27:9–10'>27:9–10</a> ). Historical and Theological Themes Since Matthew is concerned with setting forth Jesus as Messiah, the King of the Jews, an interest in the OT kingdom promises runs throughout this Gospel. Matthew’s signature phrase “the kingdom of heaven” occurs 32 times in this book (and nowhere else in all of Scripture). The opening genealogy is designed to document Christ’s credentials as Israel’s king, and the rest of the book completes this theme. Matthew shows that Christ is the heir of the kingly line. He demonstrates that He is the fulfillment of dozens of OT prophecies regarding the king who would come. He offers evidence after evidence to establish Christ’s kingly prerogative. All other historical and theological themes in the book revolve around this one. Matthew records 5 major discourses: the Sermon on the Mount (chaps. <a ref='Mt 5-7'>5–7</a> ); the commissioning of the apostles (chap. <a ref='Mt 10'>10</a> ); the parables about the kingdom (chap. <a ref='Mt 13'>13</a> ); a discourse about the childlikeness of the believer (chap. <a ref='Mt 18'>18</a> ); and the discourse on His second coming (chaps. <a ref='Mt 24-25'>24–25</a> ). Each discourse ends with a variation of this phrase: “when Jesus had finished these words” ( <a ref='Matthew 7:28'>7:28</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 11:1'>11:1</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 13:53'>13:53</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 19:1'>19:1</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 26:1'>26:1</a> ). That becomes a motif signaling a new narrative portion. A long opening section (chaps. <a ref='Mt 1-4'>1–4</a> ) and a short conclusion ( <a ref='Matthew 28:16–20'>28:16–20</a> ) bracket the rest of the Gospel, which naturally divides into 5 sections, each with a discourse and a narrative section. Some have seen a parallel between these 5 sections and the 5 books of Moses in the OT. The conflict between Christ and Pharisaism is another common theme in Matthew’s Gospel. But Matthew is keen to show the error of the Pharisees for the benefit of his Jewish audience—not for personal or self-aggrandizing reasons. Matthew omits, for example, the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector, even though that parable would have put him in a favorable light. Matthew also mentions the Sadducees more than any of the other Gospels. Both Pharisees and Sadducees are regularly portrayed negatively, and held up as warning beacons. Their doctrine is a leaven that must be avoided ( <a ref='Matthew 16:11–12'>16:11–12</a> ). Although these groups were doctrinally at odds with one another, they were united in their hatred of Christ. To Matthew, they epitomized all in Israel who rejected Christ as King. The rejection of Israel’s Messiah is another constant theme in this Gospel. In no other Gospel are the attacks against Jesus portrayed as strongly as here. From the flight into Egypt to the scene at the cross, Matthew paints a more vivid portrayal of Christ’s rejection than any of the other evangelists. In Matthew’s account of the crucifixion, for example, no thief repents, and no friends or loved ones are seen at the foot of the cross. In His death, He is forsaken even by God ( <a ref='Matthew 27:46'>27:46</a> ). The shadow of rejection is never lifted from the story. Yet Matthew portrays Him as a victorious King who will one day return “on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory” ( <a ref='Matthew 24:30'>24:30</a> ). Interpretive Challenges As noted above, Matthew groups his narrative material around 5 great discourses. He makes no attempt to follow a strict chronology, and a comparison of the Gospels reveals that Matthew freely places things out of order. He is dealing with themes and broad concepts, not laying out a timeline. The prophetic passages present a particular interpretive challenge. Jesus’ Olivet discourse, for example, contains some details that evoke images of the violent destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70. Jesus’ words in <a ref='Matthew 24:34'>24:34</a> have led some to conclude that all these things were fulfilled—albeit not literally—in the Roman conquest of that era. This is the view known as “preterism.” But this is a serious interpretive blunder, forcing the interpreter to read into these passages spiritualized, allegorical meanings unwarranted by normal exegetical methods. The grammatical-historical hermeneutical approach to these passages is the approach to follow, and it yields a consistently futuristic interpretation of crucial prophecies.

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Matthew 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ.</b> This phrase is viewed by some as Matthew’s title for the entire Gospel. The Greek phrase translated “book of the genealogy” is exactly the same phrase used in <a ref='Genesis 5:1'>Ge 5:1</a> in the LXX. <b>Jesus.</b> The Hebrew <i>Jeshua</i> means “Yahweh is Salvation.” <b>son of David.</b> A messianic title used as such in only the Synoptic Gospels ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 22:42'>22:42</a> , <a ref='Matthew 22:45'>45</a></i> ). <b>son of Abraham.</b> Takes His royal lineage all the way back to the nation’s inception in the Abrahamic Covenant ( <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 1:2'>1:2</a> For a comparison of this genealogy and the one given by Luke, <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 3:23–38'>Lk 3:23–38</a></i> . <a ref='Matthew 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>Tamar.</b> It is unusual for women to be named in genealogies. Matthew names 5: “Tamar” was a Canaanite woman who posed as a prostitute to seduce Judah ( <a ref='Genesis 38:13–30'>Ge 38:13–30</a> ). “Rahab” (v. <a ref='Matthew 1:5'>5</a> ) was a Gentile and a prostitute ( <a ref='Joshua 2:1'>Jos 2:1</a> ). “Ruth” (v. <a ref='Matthew 1:5'>5</a> ) was a Moabite woman ( <a ref='Ruth 1:3'>Ru 1:3</a> ) and a worshiper of idols. “Bathsheba” (“ <i>wife</i> of Uriah,” v. <a ref='Matthew 1:6'>6</a> ) committed adultery with David ( <a ref='2Sa 11'>2Sa 11</a> ). And “Mary” (v. <a ref='Matthew 1:16'>16</a> ) bore the stigma of pregnancy outside of wedlock. Each of these women is an object lesson about the workings of divine grace. <a ref='Matthew 1:5–6'>1:5–6</a> <b>Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab. … Jesse was the father of David the king.</b> This is not an exhaustive genealogy. Several additional generations must have elapsed between Rahab (in Joshua’s time) and David (v. <a ref='Matthew 1:6'>6</a> )—nearly 4 centuries later. Matthew’s genealogy (like most of the biblical ones) sometimes skips over several generations between well-known characters in order to abbreviate the listing. <a ref='Matthew 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>Joram was the father of Uzziah.</b> Cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 3:10–12'>1Chr 3:10–12</a> . Matthew skips over Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah, going directly from Joram to Uzziah (Azariah)—using a kind of genealogical shorthand. He seems to do this intentionally in order to make a symmetrical 3-fold division in v. <a ref='Matthew 1:17'>17</a> . <a ref='Matthew 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>Josiah was the father of Jeconiah.</b> Again, Matthew skips a generation between Josiah and Jeconiah (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 3:14–16'>1Chr 3:14–16</a> ). Jeconiah is also called Jehoiachin ( <a ref='2 Kings 24:6'>2Ki 24:6</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:8'>2Chr 36:8</a> ) and sometimes Coniah ( <a ref='Jeremiah 22:24'>Jer 22:24</a> ). Jeconiah’s presence in this genealogy presents an interesting dilemma. A curse on him forbade any of his descendants from the throne of David forever ( <a ref='Jeremiah 22:30'>Jer 22:30</a> ). Since Jesus was heir through Joseph to the royal line of descent, but not an actual son of Joseph and thus not a physical descendant through this line, the curse bypassed Him. <a ref='Matthew 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.</b> See <a ref='1 Chronicles 3:17–19'>1Chr 3:17–19</a> , where Zerubbabel is said to be the offspring of Pedaiah, Shealtiel’s brother. Elsewhere in the OT, Zerubbabel is always called the son of Shealtiel (e.g., <a ref='Haggai 1:1'>Hag 1:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 3:2'>Ezr 3:2</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 12:1'>Ne 12:1</a> ). Possibly Shealtiel adopted his nephew ( <i>see note on <a ref='Haggai 2:23'>Hag 2:23</a></i> ). Zerubbabel is the last character in Matthew’s list who appears in any of the OT genealogies. <a ref='Matthew 1:16'>1:16</a> <b>Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born.</b> The pronoun “whom” is sing., referring to Mary alone. The unusual way in which this final entry is phrased underscores the fact that Jesus was not Joseph’s literal offspring. The genealogy nonetheless establishes His claim to the throne of David as Joseph’s legal heir. <a ref='Matthew 1:17'>1:17</a> <b>fourteen generations.</b> The significance of the number 14 is not clear, but Matthew’s attention to numbers—a distinctly Hebrew characteristic—is evident throughout the Gospel. The systematic ordering may be an aid for memorization. Note that Matthew counts Jeconiah in both the third and fourth groups, representing both the last generation before the Babylonian captivity and the first generation after. <a ref='Matthew 1:18'>1:18</a> <b>betrothed.</b> Jewish betrothal was as binding as modern marriage. A divorce was necessary to terminate the betrothal (v. <a ref='Matthew 1:19'>19</a> ) and the betrothed couple were regarded legally as husband and wife (v. <a ref='Matthew 1:19'>19</a> )—although physical union had not yet taken place. <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 2:5'>Lk 2:5</a> .</i> <b>with child by the Holy Spirit.</b> See vv. <a ref='Matthew 1:20'>20</a> , <a ref='Matthew 1:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Luke 1:26–35'>Lk 1:26–35</a> . <a ref='Matthew 1:19'>1:19</a> <b>Joseph. … righteous man … planned to send her away secretly.</b> Stoning was the legal prescription for this sort of adultery ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:23–24'>Dt 22:23–24</a> ). Joseph’s righteousness meant he was also merciful; thus he did not intend to “disgrace” Mary. The phrase “a righteous man” is a Hebraism suggesting that he was a true believer in God who had thereby been declared righteous, and who carefully obeyed the law (see <a ref='Genesis 6:9'>Ge 6:9</a> ). To “send her away” would be to obtain a legal divorce ( <a ref='Matthew 19:8–9'>19:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:1'>Dt 24:1</a> ), which according to the Jewish custom was necessary in order to dissolve a betrothal ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 1:18'>18</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 1:20'>1:20</a> <b>an angel of the Lord.</b> This is one of only a few such angelic visitations in the NT, most of which are associated with Christ’s birth. For others, see <a ref='Matthew 28:2'>28:2</a> ; <a ref='Acts 5:19'>Ac 5:19</a> ; <a ref='Acts 8:26'>8:26</a> ; <a ref='Acts 10:3'>10:3</a> ; <a ref='Acts 12:7–10'>12:7–10</a> ; <a ref='Acts 27:23'>27:23</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 1:1'>Rev 1:1</a> . <b>in a dream.</b> As if to underscore the supernatural character of Christ’s advent, Matthew’s narrative of the event describes 5 such revelatory dreams: v. <a ref='Matthew 1:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 2:12–13'>2:12–13</a> , <a ref='Matthew 2:19'>19</a> , <a ref='Matthew 2:22'>22</a> . Here the angel told Joseph he was to take Mary into his own home. <a ref='Matthew 1:21'>1:21</a> <b>Jesus.</b> See v. <a ref='Matthew 1:25'>25</a> ; <a ref='Luke 1:31'>Lk 1:31</a> . The name actually means “Savior” ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 1:1'>1</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 1:22'>1:22</a> <b>would be fulfilled.</b> Matthew points out fulfillments of OT prophecies no less than a dozen times (cf. <a ref='Matthew 2:15'>2:15</a> , <a ref='Matthew 2:17'>17</a> , <a ref='Matthew 2:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 4:14'>4:14</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 8:17'>8:17</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 12:17'>12:17</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 13:14'>13:14</a> , <a ref='Matthew 13:35'>35</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 21:4'>21:4</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 26:54–56'>26:54–56</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 27:9'>27:9</a> , <a ref='Matthew 27:35'>35</a> ). He quotes from the OT more than 60 times, more frequently than any other NT writer, except Paul in Romans. <a ref='Matthew 1:23'>1:23</a> virgin <b>.</b> Scholars sometimes dispute whether the Hebrew term in <a ref='Isaiah 7:14'>Is 7:14</a> means “virgin” or “maiden.” Matthew is quoting here from the LXX which uses the unambiguous Greek term for “virgin” ( <i>see note on <a ref='Isaiah 7:14'>Is 7:14</a></i> ). Thus Matthew, writing under the Spirit’s inspiration, ends all doubt about the meaning of the word in <a ref='Isaiah 7:14'>Is 7:14</a> . Immanuel <b>.</b> Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 8:8'>Is 8:8</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 8:10'>10</a> . <a ref='Matthew 1:24'>1:24</a> <b>took</b> Mary <b>as his wife.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 2:5'>Lk 2:5</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>Bethlehem.</b> A small village on the southern outskirts of Jerusalem. Hebrew scholars in Jesus’ day clearly expected Bethlehem to be the birthplace of the Messiah (cf. <a ref='Micah 5:2'>Mic 5:2</a> ; <a ref='John 7:42'>Jn 7:42</a> ). <b>in the days of Herod the king.</b> This refers to Herod the Great, the first of several important rulers from the Herodian dynasty who are named in Scripture. This Herod, founder of the famous line, ruled from 37–4 BC. He is thought to have been Idumean, a descendant of the Edomites, offspring of Esau. Herod was ruthless and cunning. He loved opulence and grand building projects, and many of the most magnificent ruins that can be seen in modern Israel date back to the days of Herod the Great. His most famous project was the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 24:1'>24:1</a></i> ). That project alone took several decades and was not completed until long after Herod’s death (cf. <a ref='John 2:20'>Jn 2:20</a> ). <i>See note on v. <a ref='Matthew 2:22'>22</a> .</i> <b>magi from the east.</b> The number of wise men is not given. The traditional notion that there were 3 stems from the number of gifts they brought. These were not kings, but Magi, magicians or astrologers—possibly Zoroastrian wise men from Persia whose knowledge of the Hebrew Scriptures could be traced back to the time of Daniel (cf. <a ref='Daniel 5:11'>Da 5:11</a> ). <b>saying.</b> This present participle conveys the idea of continuous action. It suggests they went around the city questioning everyone they met. <a ref='Matthew 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>star.</b> This could not have been a supernova or a conjunction of planets, as some modern theories suggest, because of the way the star moved and settled over one place (cf. v. <a ref='Matthew 2:9'>9</a> ). It is more likely a supernatural reality similar to the Shekinah that guided the Israelites in the days of Moses ( <a ref='Exodus 13:21'>Ex 13:21</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 2:4'>2:4</a> <b>chief priests.</b> These were the temple hierarchy. They were mostly Sadducees ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 3:7'>3:7</a></i> ). <b>scribes.</b> Primarily Pharisees, i.e., authorities on Jewish law. Sometimes they are referred to as “scholars of the Law” ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 10:25'>Lk 10:25</a></i> ). They were professional scholars whose specialty was explaining the application of the law. They knew exactly where the Messiah was to be born (v. <a ref='Matthew 2:5'>5</a> ), but lacked the faith to accompany the Magi to the place where He was. <a ref='Matthew 2:6'>2:6</a> This ancient prophecy from <a ref='Micah 5:2'>Mic 5:2</a> was written in the eighth century BC. The original prophecy, not quoted in full by Matthew, declared the deity of Israel’s Messiah: “From you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in Israel. His goings forth are from everlasting, from the days of ancient days.” A Leader who will shepherd My people Israel <b>.</b> This portion of Matthew’s quote actually seems to be a reference to God’s words to David when Israel’s kingdom was originally established ( <a ref='2 Samuel 5:2'>2Sa 5:2</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 11:2'>1Chr 11:2</a> ). The Greek word for “leader” evokes the image of strong, even stern, leadership. “Shepherd” emphasizes tender care. Christ’s rule involves both (cf. <a ref='Revelation 12:5'>Rev 12:5</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 2:8'>2:8</a> <b>that I too may come and worship Him.</b> Herod actually wanted to kill the Child (vv. <a ref='Matthew 2:13–18'>13–18</a> ), whom he saw as a potential threat to his throne. <a ref='Matthew 2:11'>2:11</a> <b>into the house.</b> By the time the wise men arrived, Mary and Joseph were situated in a house, not a stable (cf. <a ref='Luke 2:7'>Lk 2:7</a> ). <b>the Child with Mary His mother.</b> Whenever Matthew mentions Mary in connection with her Child, Christ is always given first place (cf. vv. <a ref='Matthew 2:13–14'>13–14</a> , <a ref='Matthew 2:20–21'>20–21</a> ). <b>gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</b> Gifts suitable for a king (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 60:6'>Is 60:6</a> ). The fact that Gentiles would offer such worship had prophetic significance as well ( <a ref='Psalms 72:10'>Ps 72:10</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 2:12–13'>2:12–13</a> <b>in a dream.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 1:20'>1:20</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 2:15'>2:15</a> <b>the death of Herod.</b> Recent scholarship sets this date at 4 BC. It is probable that the stay in Egypt was very brief—perhaps no more than a few weeks. Out of Egypt <b>.</b> This quotation is from <a ref='Hosea 11:1'>Hos 11:1</a> ( <i>see note there</i> ), which speaks of God’s leading Israel out of Egypt in the Exodus. Matthew suggests that Israel’s sojourn in Egypt was a pictorial prophecy, rather than a specific verbal one such as v. <a ref='Matthew 2:6'>6</a> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 1:23'>1:23</a> . These are called “types” and all are always fulfilled in Christ, and identified clearly by the NT writers. Another example of a type is found in <a ref='John 3:14'>Jn 3:14</a> . <i>See note on v. <a ref='Matthew 2:17'>17</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 2:16'>2:16</a> <b>slew all the male children.</b> Herod’s act is all the more heinous in light of his full knowledge that the Lord’s Anointed One was the target of his murderous plot. <a ref='Matthew 2:17'>2:17</a> <b>fulfilled.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Matthew 2:15'>15</a> .</i> Again, this prophecy is in the form of a type. Verse <a ref='Matthew 2:18'>18</a> quotes <a ref='Jeremiah 31:15'>Jer 31:15</a> ( <i>see note there</i> ), which speaks of all Israel’s mourning at the time of the Babylonian captivity (ca. 586 BC). That wailing prefigured the wailing over Herod’s massacre. <a ref='Matthew 2:19'>2:19</a> <b>in a dream.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 1:20'>1:20</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 2:22'>2:22</a> <b>Archelaus.</b> Herod’s kingdom was divided 3 ways and given to his sons: Archelaus ruled Judea, Samaria, and Idumea; Herod Philip II ruled the regions north of Galilee ( <a ref='Luke 3:1'>Lk 3:1</a> ); and Herod Antipas ruled Galilee and Perea ( <a ref='Luke 3:1'>Lk 3:1</a> ). History records that Archelaus was so brutal and ineffective that he was deposed by Rome after a short reign and replaced with a governor appointed by Rome. Pontius Pilate was the fifth governor of Judea. Herod Antipas is the main Herod in the Gospel accounts. He was the one who had John the Baptist put to death ( <a ref='Matthew 14:1–12'>14:1–12</a> ), and examined Christ on the eve of the crucifixion ( <a ref='Luke 23:7–12'>Lk 23:7–12</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 2:23'>2:23</a> <b>He shall be called a Nazarene.</b> Nazareth, an obscure town 70 mi. north of Jerusalem, was a place of lowly reputation, and nowhere mentioned in the OT. Some have suggested that “Nazarene” is a reference to the Hebrew word for branch in <a ref='Isaiah 11:1'>Is 11:1</a> . Others point out that Matthew’s statement that “prophets” had made this prediction may be a reference to verbal prophecies nowhere recorded in the OT. A still more likely explanation is that Matthew is using “Nazarene” as a synonym for someone who is despised or detestable—for that was how people from the region were often characterized (cf. <a ref='John 1:46'>Jn 1:46</a> ). If that is the case, the prophecies Matthew has in mind would include <a ref='Psalms 22:6–8'>Ps 22:6–8</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 49:7'>Is 49:7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 53:3'>53:3</a> . <a ref='Matthew 3:1'>3:1</a> <b>John the Baptist.</b> Cf. <a ref='Mark 1:2–14'>Mk 1:2–14</a> ; <a ref='Luke 1:5–25'>Lk 1:5–25</a> , <a ref='Luke 1:57–80'>57–80</a> ; <a ref='Luke 3:3–20'>3:3–20</a> ; <a ref='John 1:6–8'>Jn 1:6–8</a> , <a ref='John 1:19–39'>19–39</a> . <b>the wilderness of Judea.</b> The region to the immediate west of the Dead Sea—an utterly barren desert. The Jewish sect of the Essenes had significant communities in this region. But there is no biblical evidence to suggest that John was in any way connected with that sect. John seems to have preached near the northern end of this region, close by where the Jordan flows into the Dead Sea (v. <a ref='Matthew 3:6'>6</a> ). This was a full day’s journey from Jerusalem and seems an odd location to announce the arrival of a King. But it is perfectly in keeping with God’s ways ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:26–29'>1Co 1:26–29</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 3:2'>3:2</a> <b>Repent.</b> This is no mere academic change of mind, nor mere regret or remorse. John the Baptist spoke of repentance as a radical turning from sin that inevitably became manifest in the fruit of righteousness (v. <a ref='Matthew 3:8'>8</a> ). Jesus’ first sermon began with the same imperative ( <a ref='Matthew 4:17'>4:17</a> ). For a discussion of the nature of repentance, <i>see notes on <a ref='2 Corinthians 7:8–11'>2Co 7:8–11</a></i> . <b>the kingdom of heaven.</b> This is an expression unique to Matthew’s Gospel. Matthew uses the word “heaven” as a euphemism for God’s name—to accommodate his Jewish readers’ sensitivities (cf. <a ref='Matthew 23:22'>23:22</a> ). Throughout the rest of Scripture, the kingdom is called “the kingdom of God.” Both expressions refer to the sphere of God’s dominion over those who belong to Him. The kingdom is now manifest in heaven’s spiritual rule over the hearts of believers ( <a ref='Luke 17:21'>Lk 17:21</a> ); and one day it will be established in a literal earthly kingdom ( <a ref='Revelation 20:4–6'>Rev 20:4–6</a> ). <b>is at hand.</b> In one sense the kingdom is a present reality, but in its fullest sense it awaits a yet-future fulfillment. <a ref='Matthew 3:3'>3:3</a> <b>referred to by Isaiah the prophet.</b> John’s mission had long ago been described in <a ref='Isaiah 40:3–5'>Is 40:3–5</a> ( <i>see notes there</i> ). All 4 of the Gospels cite this passage as a prophecy pointing to John the Baptist ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 3:6'>Lk 3:6</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 3:4'>3:4</a> <b>a garment of camel’s hair and a leather belt.</b> Practical and long-wearing clothes, but far from comfortable or fashionable. John evokes the image of Elijah ( <a ref='2 Kings 1:8'>2Ki 1:8</a> )—and the Israelites were expecting Elijah before the day of the Lord ( <a ref='Malachi 4:5'>Mal 4:5</a> ). <b>locusts.</b> These were an allowed food ( <a ref='Leviticus 11:22'>Lv 11:22</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 3:6'>3:6</a> <b>baptized.</b> The symbolism of John’s baptism likely had its roots in OT purification rituals (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 15:13'>Lv 15:13</a> ). Baptism had also long been administered to Gentile proselytes coming into Judaism. The baptism of John thus powerfully and dramatically symbolized repentance. Jews accepting John’s baptism were admitting they had been as Gentiles and needed to become the people of God genuinely, inwardly (an amazing admission, given their hatred of Gentiles). The people were repenting in anticipation of the Messiah’s arrival. The meaning of John’s baptism differs somewhat from Christian baptism (cf. <a ref='Acts 18:25'>Ac 18:25</a> ). Actually, Christian baptism altered the significance of the ritual, symbolizing the believer’s identification with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection ( <a ref='Romans 6:3–5'>Ro 6:3–5</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:12'>Col 2:12</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 3:7'>3:7</a> <b>Pharisees and Sadducees.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='John 3:1'>Jn 3:1</a> .</i> The Pharisees were a small (about 6,000), legalistic sect of the Jews who were known for their rigid adherence to the ceremonial fine points of the law. Their name means “separated ones.” Jesus’ interaction with the Pharisees was usually adversarial. He rebuked them for using human tradition to nullify Scripture ( <a ref='Matthew 15:3–9'>15:3–9</a> ), and especially for rank hypocrisy ( <a ref='Matthew 15:7–8'>15:7–8</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 22:18'>22:18</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 23:13'>23:13</a> , <a ref='Matthew 23:23'>23</a> , <a ref='Matthew 23:25'>25</a> , <a ref='Matthew 23:29'>29</a> ; <a ref='Luke 12:1'>Lk 12:1</a> ). The Sadducees were known for their denial of things supernatural. They denied the resurrection of the dead ( <a ref='Matthew 22:23'>22:23</a> ) and the existence of angels ( <a ref='Acts 23:8'>Ac 23:8</a> ). Unlike the Pharisees, they rejected human tradition and scorned legalism. They accepted only the Pentateuch as authoritative. They tended to be wealthy, aristocratic members of the priestly tribe, and in the days of Herod their sect controlled the temple ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 2:4'>2:4</a></i> ), though they were fewer in number than the Pharisees. Pharisees and Sadducees had little in common. Pharisees were ritualists; Sadducees were rationalists. Pharisees were legalists; Sadducees were liberals. Pharisees were separatists; Sadducees were compromisers and political opportunists. Yet they united together in their opposition to Christ ( <a ref='Matthew 22:15–16'>22:15–16</a> , <a ref='Matthew 22:23'>23</a> , <a ref='Matthew 22:34–35'>34–35</a> ). John publicly addressed them as deadly snakes. <b>the wrath to come.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 3:7'>Lk 3:7</a> .</i> John’s preaching echoed the familiar OT theme of promised wrath in the Day of the Lord (e.g., <a ref='Ezekiel 7:19'>Eze 7:19</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 1:18'>Zep 1:18</a> ; see Introduction to Joel: Historical and Theological Themes ). This must have been a particularly stinging rebuke to the Jewish leaders, who imagined that divine wrath was reserved only for non-Jews. <a ref='Matthew 3:8'>3:8</a> <b>fruit in keeping with repentance.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Matthew 3:2'>2</a> .</i> Repentance itself is not a work, but works are its inevitable fruit. Repentance and faith are inextricably linked in Scripture. Repentance means turning from one’s sin, and faith is turning to God (cf. <a ref='1 Thessalonians 1:9'>1Th 1:9</a> ). They are like opposite sides of the same coin. That is why both are linked to conversion ( <a ref='Mark 1:15'>Mk 1:15</a> ; <a ref='Acts 3:19'>Ac 3:19</a> ; <a ref='Acts 20:21'>20:21</a> ). Note that the works John demanded to see were “fruit” of repentance. But repentance itself is no more a “work” than faith is ( <i>see note on <a ref='2 Timothy 2:25'>2Ti 2:25</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 3:9'>3:9</a> <b>Abraham for our father.</b> See <a ref='John 8:39–44'>Jn 8:39–44</a> . They believed that merely being descendants of Abraham, members of God’s chosen race, made them spiritually secure. But Abraham’s real descendants are those who share his faith (cf. <a ref='Romans 4:16'>Ro 4:16</a> ). And “those who are of faith … are sons of Abraham” ( <a ref='Galatians 3:7'>Ga 3:7</a> , <a ref='Galatians 3:29'>29</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 3:8'>Lk 3:8</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 3:10'>3:10</a> <b>the axe is … laid at the root.</b> Irreversible judgment was imminent ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 11:3'>11:3</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 3:11'>3:11</a> Three types of baptism are referred to here: 1) <b>with water for repentance.</b> John’s baptism symbolized cleansing ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 3:6'>6</a></i> ); 2) <b>with the Holy Spirit.</b> All believers in Christ are Spirit-baptized ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:13'>1Co 12:13</a> ); and 3) <b>with … fire.</b> Because fire is used throughout this context as a means of judgment (vv. <a ref='Matthew 3:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Matthew 3:12'>12</a> ), this must speak of a baptism of judgment upon the unrepentant. <a ref='Matthew 3:12'>3:12</a> <b>winnowing fork.</b> A tool for tossing grain into the wind so that the chaff is blown away. <a ref='Matthew 3:14'>3:14</a> <b>John tried to prevent Him.</b> John’s baptism symbolized repentance, and John saw this as inappropriate for the One he knew was the spotless Lamb of God (cf. <a ref='John 1:29'>Jn 1:29</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 3:15'>3:15</a> <b>it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.</b> Christ was here identifying Himself with sinners. He will ultimately bear their sins; His perfect righteousness will be imputed to them ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ). This act of baptism was a necessary part of the righteousness He secured for sinners. This first public event of His ministry is also rich in meaning: 1) it pictured His death and resurrection (cf. <a ref='Luke 12:50'>Lk 12:50</a> ); 2) it therefore prefigured the significance of Christian baptism ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 3:6'>6</a></i> ); 3) it marked His first public identification with those whose sins He would bear ( <a ref='Isaiah 53:11'>Is 53:11</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 3:18'>1Pe 3:18</a> ); and 4) it was a public affirmation of His messiahship by testimony directly from heaven ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 3:17'>17</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 3:16–17'>3:16–17</a> <b>Jesus … the Spirit of God. … voice out of the heavens.</b> Here all 3 Persons of the Trinity are clearly delineated. <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 3:22'>Lk 3:22</a> .</i> The Father’s command to hear His Son and the Spirit’s vindication and empowerment ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 12:31'>12:31</a></i> ) officially inaugurated Christ’s ministry. <a ref='Matthew 3:17'>3:17</a> <b>My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased.</b> This heavenly pronouncement combines language from <a ref='Psalms 2:7'>Ps 2:7</a> and <a ref='Isaiah 42:1'>Is 42:1</a> —prophecies that would have been well known to those with messianic expectations. Cf. <a ref='Matthew 17:5'>17:5</a> ; <a ref='Mark 1:11'>Mk 1:11</a> ; <a ref='Mark 9:7'>9:7</a> ; <a ref='Luke 3:22'>Lk 3:22</a> ; <a ref='Luke 9:35'>9:35</a> . <a ref='Matthew 4:1'>4:1</a> <b>led up by the Spirit … to be tempted by the devil.</b> God Himself is never the agent of temptation ( <a ref='James 1:13'>Jas 1:13</a> ), but here—as in the book of Job—God uses even satanic tempting to serve His sovereign purposes. Christ was tempted in all points ( <a ref='Hebrews 4:15'>Heb 4:15</a> ; <a ref='1 John 2:16'>1Jn 2:16</a> ); Satan tempted Him with “the lust of the flesh” (vv. <a ref='Matthew 4:2–3'>2–3</a> ); “the lust of the eyes” (vv. <a ref='Matthew 4:8–9'>8–9</a> ); and “the pride of life” (vv. <a ref='Matthew 4:5–6'>5–6</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 4:2'>4:2</a> <b>forty days and forty nights.</b> Similarly, Moses was without food or drink on Sinai for “forty days and nights” ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 9:9'>Dt 9:9</a> ), and Elijah also fasted that long ( <a ref='1 Kings 19:8'>1Ki 19:8</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 12:40'>12:40</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 4:3'>4:3</a> <b>If You are the Son of God.</b> The conditional “if” carries the meaning of “since” in this context. There was no doubt in Satan’s mind who Jesus was; but Satan’s design was to get Him to violate the plan of God. <a ref='Matthew 4:4'>4:4</a> <b>It is written.</b> All 3 of Jesus’ replies to the Devil were taken from Deuteronomy. This one, from <a ref='Deuteronomy 8:3'>Dt 8:3</a> , states that God allowed Israel to hunger, so that He might feed them with manna and teach them to trust Him to provide for them. So the verse is directly applicable to Jesus’ circumstances and a fitting reply to Satan’s temptation. every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God <b>.</b> A more important source of sustenance than food, it nurtures our spiritual needs in a way that benefits us eternally, rather than merely providing temporal relief from physical hunger. <a ref='Matthew 4:5'>4:5</a> <b>pinnacle of the temple.</b> This was probably a roof with a portico at the southeast corner of the temple complex, where a massive retaining wall reached from a level well above the temple mount, deep into the Kidron Valley. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, this was a drop of nearly 450 ft. <a ref='Matthew 4:6'>4:6</a> <b>for it is written …</b> Lest You strike Your foot against a stone <b>.</b> Note that Satan also quoted Scripture ( <a ref='Psalms 91:11–12'>Ps 91:11–12</a> )—but utterly twisted its meaning, employing a passage about <i>trusting</i> God to justify <i>testing</i> Him. <a ref='Matthew 4:7'>4:7</a> <b>it is written.</b> Christ replied with another verse from Israel’s wilderness experience ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:16'>Dt 6:16</a> )—recalling the experience at Massah, where the grumbling Israelites put the Lord to the test, angrily demanding that Moses produce water where there was none ( <a ref='Exodus 17:2–7'>Ex 17:2–7</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 4:9'>4:9</a> <b>I will give You.</b> Satan is the “ruler of this world” ( <a ref='John 12:31'>Jn 12:31</a> ; <a ref='John 14:30'>14:30</a> ; <a ref='John 16:11'>16:11</a> ), and the “god of this age” ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:4'>2Co 4:4</a> ). The whole world lies in his power ( <a ref='1 John 5:19'>1Jn 5:19</a> ). This is illustrated in <a ref='Daniel 10:13'>Da 10:13</a> ( <i>see note there</i> ), where demonic power controlled the kingdom of Persia, so that a demon is called the prince of the kingdom of Persia. <a ref='Matthew 4:10'>4:10</a> <b>For it is written.</b> Here Christ was citing and paraphrasing <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:13–14'>Dt 6:13–14</a> . Again, these relate to the Israelites’ wilderness experiences. Christ, like them, was led into the wilderness to be tested (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 8:2'>Dt 8:2</a> ). Unlike them, He withstood every aspect of the test. <a ref='Matthew 4:11'>4:11</a> <b>angels came and</b> began to <b>minister to Him.</b> <a ref='Psalms 91:11–12'>Psalm 91:11–12</a> —the verse Satan tried to twist—was thus fulfilled in God’s way, and in God’s perfect timing. <a ref='Matthew 4:12'>4:12</a> <b>John had been taken into custody.</b> John was imprisoned for his bold rebuke of Herod Antipas. See <a ref='Matthew 14:3–4'>14:3–4</a> . <a ref='Matthew 4:13'>4:13</a> <b>leaving Nazareth.</b> Some time elapsed between vv. <a ref='Matthew 4:12'>12</a> and <a ref='Matthew 4:13'>13</a> . Jesus’ stay in Nazareth ended abruptly when He was violently rejected by the people of Nazareth, who tried to murder Him (see <a ref='Luke 4:16–30'>Lk 4:16–30</a> ). <b>Capernaum.</b> He settled in this important town on the trade route at the north end of the Sea of Galilee. Capernaum was the home of Peter and Andrew (v. <a ref='Matthew 4:18'>18</a> ), James and John (v. <a ref='Matthew 4:21'>21</a> ), and Matthew ( <a ref='Matthew 9:9'>9:9</a> ). A comparison of the Gospels reveals that Christ had already ministered extensively in Capernaum ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 4:23'>Lk 4:23</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 4:15'>4:15</a> Galilee of the Gentiles <b>.</b> This name was used even in Isaiah’s time because Galilee lay on the route through which all Gentiles passed in and out of Israel. In Jesus’ time, the region of Galilee had become an important center of Roman occupation. The prophecy cited by Matthew is from <a ref='Isaiah 9:1–2'>Is 9:1–2</a> . See <a ref='Isaiah 42:6–7'>Is 42:6–7</a> . <a ref='Matthew 4:17'>4:17</a> <b>From that time Jesus began to preach.</b> This marks the beginning of His public ministry. Note that His message was an exact echo of what John the Baptist preached. <b>Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 3:2'>3:2</a> .</i> The opening word of this first sermon sets the tone for Jesus’ entire earthly ministry (cf. <a ref='Luke 5:32'>Lk 5:32</a> ). Repentance was a constant motif in all His public preaching. And in His closing charge to the apostles, He commanded them to preach repentance as well ( <a ref='Luke 24:47'>Lk 24:47</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 4:18'>4:18</a> <b>two brothers.</b> Jesus had encountered Peter and Andrew before, near Bethabara, in the Jordan region, where Andrew (and perhaps Peter as well) had become a disciple of John the Baptist ( <a ref='John 1:35–42'>Jn 1:35–42</a> ). They left John to follow Jesus for a time before returning to fishing in Capernaum. Perhaps they had returned to Capernaum during Jesus’ earlier ministry here ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 4:23'>Lk 4:23</a></i> ). Here He called them to follow Him in long-term discipleship. <a ref='Matthew 4:21'>4:21</a> <b>James the</b> son <b>of Zebedee.</b> This James is easy to distinguish from the other men named James in the NT, because he is never mentioned in Scripture apart from his brother John. His martyrdom by Herod Agrippa I marked the beginning of a time of severe persecution in the early church ( <a ref='Acts 12:2'>Ac 12:2</a> ). For information on others named James, <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 10:2'>10:2</a></i> ; Introduction to James: Author and Date . <a ref='Matthew 4:23'>4:23</a> <b>teaching … preaching the gospel … healing.</b> The 3 main aspects of Christ’s public ministry. <a ref='Matthew 4:24'>4:24</a> <b>Syria.</b> The area immediately northeast of Galilee. <a ref='Matthew 4:25'>4:25</a> <b>Decapolis.</b> A confederation of 10 Hellenized cities south of Galilee and mostly east of the Jordan. The league of cities was formed shortly after Pompey’s invasion of Israel (ca. 64 BC) to preserve Greek culture in the Semitic region. These cities were naturally Gentile strongholds. <a ref='Matthew 5:1–7:29'>5:1—7:29</a> The Sermon on the Mount introduces a series of 5 important discourses recorded in Matthew (see Introduction: Historical and Theological Themes ). This sermon is a masterful exposition of the law and a potent assault on Pharisaic legalism, closing with a call to true faith and salvation ( <a ref='Matthew 7:13–29'>7:13–29</a> ). Christ expounded the full meaning of the law, showing that its demands were humanly impossible (cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:48'>5:48</a> ). This is the proper use of the law with respect to salvation: it closes off every possible avenue of human merit and leaves sinners dependent on nothing but divine grace for salvation (cf. <a ref='Romans 3:19–20'>Ro 3:19–20</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:23–24'>Ga 3:23–24</a> ). Christ plumbed the depth of the law, showing that its true demands went far beyond the surface meaning of the words ( <a ref='Matthew 5:28'>5:28</a> , <a ref='Matthew 5:39'>39</a> , <a ref='Matthew 5:44'>44</a> ) and set a standard that is higher than the most diligent students of the law had heretofore realized ( <a ref='Matthew 5:20'>5:20</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 6:17–49'>Lk 6:17–49</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 5:1'>5:1</a> <b>He sat down.</b> This was the normal posture for rabbis while teaching (cf. <a ref='Matthew 13:1–2'>13:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 26:55'>26:55</a> ; <a ref='Mark 4:1'>Mk 4:1</a> ; <a ref='Mark 9:35'>9:35</a> ; <a ref='Luke 5:3'>Lk 5:3</a> ; <a ref='John 6:3'>Jn 6:3</a> ; <a ref='John 8:2'>8:2</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 4:20'>Lk 4:20</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 5:3'>5:3</a> <b>Blessed.</b> The word lit. means “happy, fortunate, blissful.” Here it speaks of more than a surface emotion. Jesus was describing the divinely bestowed well-being that belongs only to the faithful. The Beatitudes demonstrate that the way to heavenly blessedness is antithetical to the worldly path normally followed in pursuit of happiness. The worldly idea is that happiness is found in riches, merriment, abundance, leisure, and such things. The real truth is the very opposite. The Beatitudes give Jesus’ description of the character of true faith. <b>poor in spirit.</b> The opposite of self-sufficiency. This speaks of the deep humility of recognizing one’s utter spiritual bankruptcy apart from God. It describes those who are acutely conscious of their own lostness and hopelessness apart from divine grace (cf. <a ref='Matthew 9:12'>9:12</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:13'>Lk 18:13</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 19:17'>19:17</a> .</i> <b>theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 3:2'>3:2</a> .</i> Notice that the truth of salvation by grace is clearly presupposed in this opening verse of the Sermon on the Mount. Jesus was teaching that the kingdom is a gracious gift to those who sense their own poverty of spirit. <a ref='Matthew 5:4'>5:4</a> <b>those who mourn.</b> This speaks of mourning over sin, the godly sorrow that produces repentance leading to salvation without regret ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 7:10'>2Co 7:10</a> ). The “comfort” is the comfort of forgiveness and salvation (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 40:1–2'>Is 40:1–2</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 5:5'>5:5</a> <b>the lowly.</b> Lowliness or gentleness or meekness is the opposite of being out of control. It is not weakness, but supreme self-control empowered by the Spirit (cf. <a ref='Galatians 5:23'>Ga 5:23</a> ). The statement that the lowly “shall inherit the earth” is quoted from <a ref='Psalms 37:11'>Ps 37:11</a> . <a ref='Matthew 5:6'>5:6</a> <b>hunger and thirst for righteousness.</b> This is the opposite of the self-righteousness of the Pharisees. It speaks of those who seek God’s righteousness rather than attempting to establish a righteousness of their own ( <a ref='Romans 10:3'>Ro 10:3</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:9'>Php 3:9</a> ). What they seek will fill them, i.e., it will satisfy their hunger and thirst for a right relationship with God. <a ref='Matthew 5:7'>5:7</a> <b>they shall receive mercy.</b> The converse is also true. Cf. <a ref='James 2:13'>Jas 2:13</a> . <a ref='Matthew 5:8'>5:8</a> <b>see God.</b> Not only with the perception of faith, but in the glory of heaven. Cf. <a ref='Hebrews 12:14'>Heb 12:14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 22:3–4'>Rev 22:3–4</a> . <a ref='Matthew 5:9'>5:9</a> <b>peacemakers.</b> See vv. <a ref='Matthew 5:44–45'>44–45</a> for more on this quality. <a ref='Matthew 5:10'>5:10</a> <b>persecuted.</b> Cf. <a ref='James 5:10–11'>Jas 5:10–11</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 4:12–14'>1Pe 4:12–14</a> . <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 6:22'>Lk 6:22</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 5:13'>5:13</a> <b>salt … tasteless, how will it be made salty</b> again <b>?</b> Salt is both a preservative and a flavor enhancer. No doubt its use as a preservative is what Jesus had mostly in view here. Pure salt cannot lose its flavor or effectiveness, but the salt that is common in the Dead Sea area is contaminated with gypsum and other minerals and may have a flat taste or be ineffective as a preservative. Such mineral salts were useful for little more than keeping footpaths free of vegetation. <a ref='Matthew 5:16'>5:16</a> <b>light shine.</b> A godly life gives convincing testimony of the saving power of God. That brings Him glory. Cf. <a ref='1 Peter 2:12'>1Pe 2:12</a> . <a ref='Matthew 5:17'>5:17</a> <b>Do not think … abolish the Law or the Prophets.</b> Jesus was neither giving a new law nor modifying the old, but rather explaining the true significance of the moral content of Moses’ law and the rest of the OT. “The Law and the Prophets” speaks of the entirety of the OT Scriptures, not the rabbinical interpretations of them. <b>fulfill.</b> This speaks of fulfillment in the same sense that prophecy is fulfilled. Christ was indicating that He is the fulfillment of the law in all its aspects. He fulfilled the moral law by keeping it perfectly. He fulfilled the ceremonial law by being the embodiment of everything the law’s types and symbols pointed to. And He fulfilled the judicial law by personifying God’s perfect justice (cf. <a ref='Matthew 12:18'>12:18</a> , <a ref='Matthew 12:20'>20</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 5:18'>5:18</a> <b>until heaven and earth pass away … until all is accomplished.</b> Here Christ was affirming the utter inerrancy and absolute authority of the OT as the Word of God—down to the smallest stroke or letter. Again ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 5:17'>17</a></i> ), this suggests that the NT should not be seen as supplanting and abrogating the OT, but as fulfilling and explicating it. For example, all the ceremonial requirements of the Mosaic law were fulfilled in Christ and are no longer to be observed by Christians ( <a ref='Colossians 2:16–17'>Col 2:16–17</a> ). Yet not the smallest letter or stroke is thereby erased; the underlying truths of those Scriptures remain—and in fact the mysteries behind them are now revealed in the brighter light of the gospel. <b>smallest letter or stroke.</b> The phrase “smallest letter” refers to the smallest Hebrew letter, the <i>yohd</i> , which is a meager stroke of the pen, like an accent mark or an apostrophe. The “stroke” is a tiny extension on a Hebrew letter, like the serif in modern typefaces. <a ref='Matthew 5:19'>5:19</a> <b>shall be called least … shall be called great.</b> The consequence of practicing or teaching disobedience of any of God’s Word is to be called least in the kingdom of heaven (see note on <a ref='James 2:10'>Jas 2:10</a> ). Determining rank in the kingdom of heaven is entirely God’s prerogative (cf. <a ref='Matthew 20:23'>Mt 20:23</a> ), and Jesus declares that He will hold those in lowest esteem who hold His Word in low esteem. There is no impunity for believers who disobey, discredit, or belittle God’s law (see note on <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:10'>2Co 5:10</a> ). That Jesus does not refer to loss of salvation is clear from the fact that, though offenders will be called least, they will still be in the kingdom of heaven. The positive result is that whoever keeps and teaches God’s Word, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Here again Jesus mentions the two aspects of doing and teaching. Kingdom citizens are to uphold every part of God’s law both in their living and in their teaching. <a ref='Matthew 5:20'>5:20</a> <b>unless your righteousness surpasses</b> that <b>of the scribes and Pharisees.</b> On the one hand, Jesus was calling His disciples to a deeper, more radical holiness than that of the Pharisees. Pharisaism had a tendency to soften the law’s demands by focusing only on external obedience. In the verses that follow, Jesus unpacks the full moral significance of the law, and shows that the righteousness the law calls for actually involves an internal conformity to the spirit of the law, rather than mere external compliance to the letter. <b>will not enter the kingdom of heaven.</b> On the other hand, this sets up an impossible barrier to works-salvation. Scripture teaches repeatedly that sinners are capable of nothing but a flawed and imperfect righteousness (e.g., <a ref='Isaiah 64:6'>Is 64:6</a> ). Therefore, the only righteousness by which sinners may be justified is the perfect righteousness of God that is imputed to those who believe ( <a ref='Genesis 15:6'>Ge 15:6</a> ; <a ref='Romans 4:5'>Ro 4:5</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 5:21–22'>5:21–22</a> <b>You have heard … But I say to you.</b> See vv. <a ref='Matthew 5:27'>27</a> , <a ref='Matthew 5:31'>31</a> , <a ref='Matthew 5:33'>33</a> , <a ref='Matthew 5:38'>38</a> , <a ref='Matthew 5:43'>43</a> . The quotes are from <a ref='Exodus 20:13'>Ex 20:13</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:17'>Dt 5:17</a> . Jesus was not altering the terms of the law in any of these passages. Rather, He was correcting what they had “heard”—the rabbinical understanding of the law ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 5:38'>38</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 5:22'>5:22</a> <b>Raca.</b> Lit. “Empty-headed.” Jesus suggested here that the verbal abuse stems from the same sinful motives (anger and hatred) that ultimately lead to murder. The internal attitude is what the law actually prohibits, and therefore an abusive insult carries the same kind of moral guilt as an act of murder. <b>hell.</b> A reference to the Hinnom Valley, southwest of Jerusalem. Ahaz and Manasseh permitted human sacrifices there during their reigns ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 28:3'>2Chr 28:3</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 33:6'>33:6</a> ), and therefore it was called “the valley of Slaughter” ( <a ref='Jeremiah 19:6'>Jer 19:6</a> ). In Jesus’ day, it was a garbage dump where fires burned continually and was thus an apt symbol of eternal fire. <a ref='Matthew 5:25'>5:25</a> <b>Make friends quickly.</b> Jesus calls for reconciliation to be sought eagerly, aggressively, quickly—even if it involves self-sacrifice. It is better to be wronged than to allow a dispute between brethren to be a cause for dishonoring Christ ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:7'>1Co 6:7</a> ). <b>opponent.</b> This speaks of one’s adversary in a law case. <b>prison.</b> Debtor’s prison, where the person could work to earn back what he had defrauded. <a ref='Matthew 5:27'>5:27</a> Quoted from <a ref='Exodus 20:14'>Ex 20:14</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:18'>Dt 5:18</a> . <a ref='Matthew 5:29'>5:29</a> <b>tear it out and throw it from you.</b> Jesus was not advocating self-mutilation (for this would not in fact cure lust, which is actually a problem of the heart). He was using this graphic hyperbole to demonstrate the seriousness of sins of lust and evil desire. The point is that it would be “better” (v. <a ref='Matthew 5:30'>30</a> ) to lose a member of one’s own body than to bear the eternal consequences of the guilt from such a sin. Sin must be dealt with drastically because of its deadly effects. <a ref='Matthew 5:31'>5:31</a> <b>it was said.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:1–4'>Dt 24:1–4</a> .</i> The rabbis had taken liberty with what Scripture actually said. They referred to <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:1–4'>Dt 24:1–4</a> as if it were given merely to regulate the paperwork when one sought divorce ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 19:7'>19:7</a></i> ). Thus, they had wrongly concluded that men could divorce their wives for anything that displeased them, as long as they gave “a certificate of divorce.” But Moses provided this as a concession to protect the woman who was divorced ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 19:7–9'>19:7–9</a></i> ), not to justify or legalize divorce under all circumstances. <a ref='Matthew 5:32'>5:32</a> <b>except for … sexual immorality.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 19:9'>19:9</a> .</i> Divorce was allowed in cases of adultery. <a ref='Luke 16:18'>Luke 16:18</a> must be understood in the light of this verse. <b>makes her commit adultery.</b> The assumption is that divorced people will remarry. If the divorce was not for sexual immorality, any remarriage is adultery, because God does not acknowledge the divorce. For more on divorce, <i>see note on <a ref='1 Corinthians 7:15'>1Co 7:15</a></i> . <a ref='Matthew 5:33'>5:33</a> You shall not make false vows <b>.</b> This expresses teaching from <a ref='Leviticus 19:12'>Lv 19:12</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 30:2'>Nu 30:2</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:21'>Dt 23:21</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:23'>23</a> . <a ref='Matthew 5:34'>5:34</a> <b>make no oath at all.</b> Cf. <a ref='James 5:12'>Jas 5:12</a> . This should not be taken as a universal condemnation of oaths in all circumstances. God Himself confirmed a promise with an oath ( <a ref='Hebrews 6:13–18'>Heb 6:13–18</a> ; cf. <a ref='Acts 2:30'>Ac 2:30</a> ). Christ Himself spoke under oath ( <a ref='Matthew 26:63–64'>26:63–64</a> ). And the law prescribed oaths in certain circumstances (e.g., <a ref='Numbers 5:19'>Nu 5:19</a> , <a ref='Numbers 5:21'>21</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 30:2–3'>30:2–3</a> ). What Christ is forbidding here is the flippant, profane, or careless use of oaths in everyday speech. In that culture, such oaths were often employed for deceptive purposes. To make the person being victimized believe the truth was being told, the Jews would swear by “heaven,” “earth,” “Jerusalem,” or their own “heads” (vv. <a ref='Matthew 5:34–36'>34–36</a> ), not by God, hoping to avoid divine judgment for their lie. But it all was in God’s creation, so it drew Him in and produced guilt before Him, exactly as if the oath were made in His name. Jesus suggested that all our speech should be as if we were under an oath to tell the truth (v. <a ref='Matthew 5:37'>37</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 5:38'>5:38</a> An eye for an eye <b>.</b> The law did establish this standard as a principle for limiting retribution to that which was just ( <a ref='Exodus 21:24'>Ex 21:24</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 24:20'>Lv 24:20</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:21'>Dt 19:21</a> ). Its design was to ensure that the punishment in civil cases fit the crime. It was never meant to sanction acts of personal retaliation. So again ( <i>see notes on vv. <a ref='Matthew 5:17–18'>17–18</a></i> ) Jesus made no alteration to the true meaning of the law. He was merely explaining and affirming the law’s true meaning. <a ref='Matthew 5:39'>5:39</a> <b>do not resist an evil person.</b> Like v. <a ref='Matthew 5:38'>38</a> , this deals only with matters of personal retaliation, not criminal offenses or acts of military aggression. Jesus applied this principle of nonretaliation to affronts against one’s dignity (v. <a ref='Matthew 5:39'>39</a> ), lawsuits to gain one’s personal assets (v. <a ref='Matthew 5:40'>40</a> ), infringements on one’s liberty (v. <a ref='Matthew 5:41'>41</a> ), and violations of property rights (v. <a ref='Matthew 5:42'>42</a> ). He was calling for a full surrender of all personal rights. <a ref='Matthew 5:41'>5:41</a> <b>forces.</b> The word speaks of coercion. The NT picture of this is when Roman soldiers forced Simon the Cyrene to carry Jesus’ cross ( <a ref='Matthew 27:32'>27:32</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 5:43'>5:43</a> love your neighbor <b>and hate your enemy.</b> The first half of this is found in Moses’ law ( <a ref='Leviticus 19:18'>Lv 19:18</a> ). The second part was found in how the scribes and Pharisees explained and applied that OT command. Jesus’ application was exactly the opposite, resulting in a much higher standard: love for one’s neighbors should extend even to those neighbors who are enemies (v. <a ref='Matthew 27:44'>44</a> ). Again, this was no innovation, since even the OT taught that God’s people should do good to their enemies ( <a ref='Proverbs 25:21'>Pr 25:21</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 5:44–45'>5:44–45</a> <b>love your enemies … that you may be sons of your Father.</b> This plainly teaches that God’s love extends even to His enemies. This universal love of God is manifest in blessings which God bestows on all indiscriminately. Theologians refer to this as common grace. This must be distinguished from the everlasting love God has for the elect ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:3'>Jer 31:3</a> ), but it is a sincere goodwill nonetheless (cf. <a ref='Psalms 145:9'>Ps 145:9</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 5:46'>5:46</a> <b>tax collectors.</b> Disloyal Israelites hired by the Romans to tax other Jews for personal profit. They became symbols for the worst kind of people. Cf. <a ref='Matthew 9:10–11'>9:10–11</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 11:19'>11:19</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 18:17'>18:17</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 21:31'>21:31</a> ; <a ref='Mark 2:14–16'>Mk 2:14–16</a> ; <a ref='Luke 5:30'>Lk 5:30</a> ; <a ref='Luke 7:25'>7:25</a> , <a ref='Luke 7:29'>29</a> , <a ref='Luke 7:34'>34</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:11–13'>18:11–13</a> . Matthew had been one of them ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 9:9'>9:9</a> ; <a ref='Mark 2:15'>Mk 2:15</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 5:48'>5:48</a> <b>you are to be perfect.</b> Christ sets an unattainable standard. This sums up what the law itself demanded ( <a ref='James 2:10'>Jas 2:10</a> ). Though this standard is impossible to meet, God could not lower it without compromising His own perfection. He who is perfect could not set an imperfect standard of righteousness. The marvelous truth of the gospel is that Christ has met this standard on our behalf ( <i>see note on <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 6:1–18'>6:1–18</a> Here Christ expands the thought of <a ref='Matthew 5:20'>5:20</a> , showing how the Pharisees’ righteousness was deficient by exposing their hypocrisy in the matters of giving to the poor (vv. <a ref='Matthew 6:1–4'>1–4</a> ); prayer (vv. <a ref='Matthew 6:5–15'>5–15</a> ); and fasting (vv. <a ref='Matthew 6:16–18'>16–18</a> ). All of these acts are supposed to be worship rendered to God, never displays of self-righteousness to gain the admiration of others. <a ref='Matthew 6:2'>6:2</a> <b>hypocrites.</b> This word had its origins in Greek theater, describing a character who wore a mask. The term, as used in the NT, normally described an unregenerate person who was self-deceived. <b>they have their reward.</b> Cf. vv. <a ref='Matthew 6:5'>5</a> , <a ref='Matthew 6:16'>16</a> . Their reward is that they were seen by men, nothing more. God does not reward hypocrisy, but He does punish it (cf. <a ref='Matthew 23:13–23'>23:13–23</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 6:4'>6:4</a> <b>sees … in secret.</b> Cf. vv. <a ref='Matthew 6:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Matthew 6:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 17:10'>Jer 17:10</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 4:13'>Heb 4:13</a> . God is omniscient. <a ref='Matthew 6:7'>6:7</a> <b>meaningless repetition.</b> Prayers are not to be merely recited, nor are our words to be repeated thoughtlessly, or as if they were automatic formulas. But this is not a prohibition against importunity ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Luke 11:1–8'>Lk 11:1–8</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 6:9'>6:9</a> <b>in this way.</b> Cf. <a ref='Luke 11:2–4'>Lk 11:2–4</a> . The prayer is a model, not merely a liturgy. It is notable for its brevity, simplicity, and comprehensiveness. Of the 6 petitions, 3 are directed to God (vv. <a ref='Matthew 6:9–10'>9–10</a> ) and 3 toward human needs (vv. <a ref='Matthew 6:11–13'>11–13</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 6:10'>6:10</a> <b>Your will be done.</b> All prayer, first of all, willingly submits to God’s purposes, plans, and glory. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 26:39'>26:39</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 6:12'>6:12</a> <b>forgive us our debts.</b> The parallel passage ( <a ref='Luke 11:4'>Lk 11:4</a> ) uses a word that means “sins,” so that in context, spiritual debts are intended. Sinners are debtors to God for their violations of His laws ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 18:23–27'>18:23–27</a></i> ). This request is the heart of the prayer; it is what Jesus stressed in the words that immediately follow the prayer (vv. <a ref='Matthew 6:14–15'>14–15</a> ; cf. <a ref='Mark 11:25'>Mk 11:25</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 6:13'>6:13</a> <b>do not lead us into temptation.</b> Cf. <a ref='Luke 22:40'>Lk 22:40</a> . God does not tempt men ( <a ref='James 1:13'>Jas 1:13</a> ), but He will subject them to trials that may expose them to Satan’s assaults, as in the case of Job and Peter ( <a ref='Luke 22:31–32'>Lk 22:31–32</a> ). This petition reflects the believing one’s desire to avoid the dangers of sin altogether. God knows what one’s need is before one asks (v. <a ref='Matthew 6:8'>8</a> ), and He promises that no one will be subjected to testing beyond what can be endured. He also promises a way of escape—often through endurance ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:13'>1Co 10:13</a> ). But still, the proper attitude for the believer is the one expressed in this petition. <a ref='Matthew 6:15'>6:15</a> <b>then your Father will not forgive your transgressions.</b> This is not to suggest that God will withdraw justification from those who have already received the free pardon He extends to all believers. Forgiveness in that sense—a permanent and complete acquittal from the guilt and ultimate penalty of sin—belongs to all who are in Christ (cf. <a ref='John 5:24'>Jn 5:24</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:1'>Ro 8:1</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:7'>Eph 1:7</a> ). Yet, Scripture also teaches that God chastens His children who disobey ( <a ref='Hebrews 12:5–7'>Heb 12:5–7</a> ). Believers are to confess their sins in order to obtain a day-to-day cleansing ( <a ref='1 John 1:9'>1Jn 1:9</a> ). This sort of forgiveness is a simple washing from the worldly defilements of sin, not a repeat of the wholesale cleansing from sin’s corruption that comes with justification. It is like a washing of the feet rather than a bath (cf. <a ref='John 13:10'>Jn 13:10</a> ). Forgiveness in this latter sense is what God threatens to withhold from Christians who refuse to forgive others (cf. <a ref='Matthew 18:23–35'>18:23–35</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 6:16–17'>6:16–17</a> <b>whenever you fast.</b> This indicates that fasting is assumed to be a normal part of one’s spiritual life (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 7:5'>1Co 7:5</a> ). Fasting is associated with sadness ( <a ref='Matthew 9:14–15'>9:14–15</a> ), prayer ( <a ref='Matthew 17:21'>17:21</a> ), charity ( <a ref='Isaiah 58:3–6'>Is 58:3–6</a> ), and seeking the Lord’s will ( <a ref='Acts 13:2–3'>Ac 13:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Acts 14:23'>14:23</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 6:20'>6:20</a> <b>treasures.</b> Don’t amass earthly wealth. Jesus commends the use of financial assets for purposes which are heavenly and eternal. <i>See notes on <a ref='Luke 16:1–9'>Lk 16:1–9</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 6:22–23'>6:22–23</a> This is an argument from the lesser to the greater. The analogy is simple. If your eye is bad, no light can come in, and you are left with darkness because of that malady. How much worse when the problem is not merely related to external perception, but an internal corruption of one’s whole nature, so that the darkness actually emanates from within and affects one’s whole being. Jesus was indicting them for their superficial earthly religion that left their hearts dark. <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 11:34'>Lk 11:34</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 6:24'>6:24</a> <b>wealth.</b> Earthly, material treasures, especially money. <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 16:13'>Lk 16:13</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 6:26'>6:26</a> <b>your heavenly Father feeds them.</b> Obviously this in no way advocates a sinful kind of idleness ( <a ref='Proverbs 19:15'>Pr 19:15</a> ). Birds are not idle, either. But it is God who provides them with food to eat. <a ref='Matthew 6:29'>6:29</a> <b>Solomon in all his glory.</b> The glory and pageantry of Solomon’s kingdom was famous worldwide. Cf. <a ref='2Ch 9'>2Chr 9</a> . <a ref='Matthew 6:30'>6:30</a> <b>You of little faith!</b> Cf. <a ref='Matthew 8:26'>8:26</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 14:31'>14:31</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 16:8'>16:8</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 17:20'>17:20</a> . This was the Lord’s recurring rebuke of the weak disciples. <a ref='Matthew 6:32'>6:32</a> <b>Gentiles.</b> I.e., those outside the people of promise and outside the blessing of God. Cf. <a ref='Ephesians 4:17–19'>Eph 4:17–19</a> . <a ref='Matthew 6:33'>6:33</a> <b>His kingdom.</b> This is the same as the kingdom of heaven. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 3:2'>3:2</a> .</i> It refers to the sphere of salvation. Jesus was urging them to seek salvation—and with it would come the full care and provision of God. Cf. <a ref='Romans 8:32'>Ro 8:32</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 4:19'>Php 4:19</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 5:7'>1Pe 5:7</a> . <a ref='Matthew 7:1'>7:1</a> <b>Do not judge.</b> As the context reveals, this does not prohibit all types of judging (v. <a ref='Matthew 7:16'>16</a> ). There is a righteous kind of judgment we are supposed to exercise with careful discernment ( <a ref='John 7:24'>Jn 7:24</a> ). Censorious, hypocritical, self-righteous, or other kinds of unfair judgments are forbidden; but in order to fulfill the commandments that follow, it is necessary to discern dogs and swine (v. <a ref='Matthew 7:6'>6</a> ) from one’s own brethren (vv. <a ref='Matthew 7:3–5'>3–5</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 7:6'>7:6</a> <b>Do not give what is holy to dogs.</b> This principle is why Jesus Himself did not do miracles for unbelievers ( <a ref='Matthew 13:58'>13:58</a> ). This is to be done in respect for what is holy, not merely out of contempt for the dogs and swine. Nothing here contradicts the principle of <a ref='Matthew 5:44'>5:44</a> . That verse governs personal dealings with one’s enemies ( <i>see note there</i> ); this principle governs how one handles the gospel in the face of those who hate the truth. <a ref='Matthew 7:11'>7:11</a> <b>you … being evil.</b> Jesus presupposes the doctrine of human depravity ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 1:18–3:20'>Ro 1:18—3:20</a></i> ). <b>how much more.</b> If earthly fathers give what their sons need (vv. <a ref='Matthew 7:9–10'>9–10</a> ), will not God give to His sons what they ask (vv. <a ref='Matthew 7:7–8'>7–8</a> )? <i>See note on <a ref='James 1:17'>Jas 1:17</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 7:12'>7:12</a> <b>whatever you want people to do for you, so do for them.</b> Versions of the “Golden Rule” existed before Christ, in the rabbinic writings and even in Hinduism and Buddhism. All of them cast the rule as a negative command, such as Rabbi Hillel’s version, “What is hateful to yourself do not to someone else.” Jesus made it a positive command, enriching its meaning and underscoring that this one imperative aptly summarizes the whole gist of the ethical principles contained in the Law and the Prophets. <a ref='Matthew 7:13–29'>7:13–29</a> This closing section of the Sermon on the Mount is a gospel application. Here are two gates, two ways, two destinations, and two groups of people (vv. <a ref='Matthew 7:13–14'>13–14</a> ); two kinds of trees and two kinds of fruit (vv. <a ref='Matthew 7:17–20'>17–20</a> ); two groups at the judgment (vv. <a ref='Matthew 7:21–23'>21–23</a> ); and two kinds of builders, building on two kinds of foundations (vv. <a ref='Matthew 7:24–28'>24–28</a> ). Christ is drawing the line as clearly as possible between the way that leads to destruction and the way that leads to life. <a ref='Matthew 7:13–14'>7:13–14</a> Both the narrow gate and the wide gate are assumed to provide the entrance to God’s kingdom. Two ways are offered to people. The narrow gate is by faith, only through Christ, constricted and precise. It represents true salvation in God’s way that leads to life eternal. The wide gate includes all religions of works and self-righteousness, with no single way (cf. <a ref='Acts 4:12'>Ac 4:12</a> ), but it leads to hell, not heaven. <a ref='Matthew 7:14'>7:14</a> <b>way is constricted.</b> Christ continually emphasized the difficulty of following Him ( <a ref='Matthew 10:38'>10:38</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 16:24–25'>16:24–25</a> ; <a ref='John 15:18–19'>Jn 15:18–19</a> ; <a ref='John 16:1–3'>16:1–3</a> ; cf. <a ref='Acts 14:22'>Ac 14:22</a> ). Salvation is by grace alone, but is not easy. It calls for knowledge of the truth, repentance, submission to Christ as Lord, and a willingness to obey His will and Word. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 19:16–28'>19:16–28</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 7:15'>7:15</a> <b>false prophets.</b> These deceive not by disguising themselves as sheep, but by impersonating true shepherds.

Cf. <a ref='2 Peter 2:12–22'>2Pe 2:12–22</a> . <a ref='Matthew 7:21'>7:21</a> <b>Not everyone who says … but he who does.</b> The barrenness of this sort of faith demonstrates its real character (cf. v. <a ref='Matthew 7:20'>20</a> )—the faith that says but does not do is really unbelief. Jesus was not suggesting that works are meritorious for salvation, but that true faith will not fail to produce the fruit of good works. This is precisely the point of <a ref='James 1:22–25'>Jas 1:22–25</a> ; <a ref='James 2:26'>2:26</a> . <a ref='Matthew 7:22'>7:22</a> <b>did we not prophesy … cast out demons … do many miracles?</b> Note that far from being totally devoid of works of any kind, these people were claiming to have done some remarkable signs and wonders. In fact, their whole confidence was in these works—further proof that these works, spectacular as they might have appeared, could not have been authentic. No one so bereft of genuine faith could possibly produce true good works. A bad tree cannot bear good fruit (v. <a ref='Matthew 7:18'>18</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 7:23'>7:23</a> lawlessness <b>.</b> All sin is lawlessness ( <a ref='1 John 3:4'>1Jn 3:4</a> ), i.e., rebellion against the law of God (cf. <a ref='Matthew 13:41'>13:41</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 7:24–27'>7:24–27</a> The house represents a religious life; the rain represents divine judgment. Only the house built on the foundation of obedience to God’s Word stands, which calls for repentance, rejection of salvation by works, and trust in God’s grace to save through His merciful provision. <i>See notes on <a ref='James 1:22–25'>Jas 1:22–25</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 7:29'>7:29</a> <b>not as their scribes.</b> The scribes quoted others to establish the authority of their teachings; Jesus was His own authority ( <a ref='Matthew 28:18'>28:18</a> ). This matter of authority was a major issue between Jesus and the Jews, who felt their authority challenged. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 21:23'>21:23</a> .</i> Cf. <a ref='Mark 1:22'>Mk 1:22</a> ; <a ref='Mark 11:28–33'>11:28–33</a> ; <a ref='Luke 4:32'>Lk 4:32</a> ; <a ref='Luke 20:2–8'>20:2–8</a> ; <a ref='John 12:49–50'>Jn 12:49–50</a> ; <a ref='John 14:10'>14:10</a> . <a ref='Matthew 8:1'>8:1</a> <b>down from the mountain.</b> Cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:1'>5:1</a> . <a ref='Matthew 8:2'>8:2</a> <b>if You are willing.</b> He had no doubt about Christ’s power, only His will (cf. <a ref='Mark 1:40–45'>Mk 1:40–45</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 8:4'>8:4</a> <b>tell no one.</b> Publicity over such miracles might hinder Christ’s mission and divert public attention from His message. Mark records that this is precisely what happened. In this man’s exuberance over the miracle, he disobeyed; as a result, Christ had to move His ministry away from the city and into the desert regions ( <a ref='Mark 1:45'>Mk 1:45</a> ). <b>the offering that Moses commanded.</b> A sacrifice of two birds, one of which was killed and the other set free ( <a ref='Leviticus 14:4–7'>Lv 14:4–7</a> ). <b>as a testimony to them.</b> I.e., the priests. <a ref='Matthew 8:5'>8:5</a> <b>Capernaum.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 4:13'>4:13</a> .</i> <b>centurion.</b> A Roman military officer who commanded (cf. v. <a ref='Matthew 8:9'>9</a> ) 100 men.

Matthew makes no mention of the intermediaries. <a ref='Matthew 8:8'>8:8</a> <b>I am not good enough for You to come under my roof.</b> Jewish tradition held that a person who entered a Gentile’s house was ceremonially defiled (cf. <a ref='John 18:28'>Jn 18:28</a> ). The centurion, undoubtedly familiar with this law, felt unworthy of having Jesus suffer such an inconvenience for his sake. He also had faith enough to know that Christ could heal by merely speaking a word ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 8:10'>10</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 8:10'>8:10</a> <b>I have not found such great faith with anyone in Israel.</b> This centurion understood Jesus’ absolute authority (vv. <a ref='Matthew 8:8–9'>8–9</a> ).

Such a large herd of unclean animals suggests that Gentiles dominated the region.

Christ actually proved His power to forgive by instantly healing the man of his paralysis. If He could do the apparently harder, He could also do what seemed easier. The actual forgiving of the sins was in reality the more difficult task, however, because it ultimately required Him to sacrifice His life. <a ref='Matthew 9:9'>9:9</a> <b>sitting in the tax office.</b> Matthew’s own humility is seen here.

Tax collectors were among the most despised persons in this society. The money they collected was often partly extorted for personal gain (cf. <a ref='Luke 19:8'>Lk 19:8</a> ) and partly a tax for Rome, which made them not only thieves, but also traitors to the Jewish nation ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 5:46'>5:46</a> ; <a ref='Mark 2:15'>Mk 2:15</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 9:11'>9:11</a> <b>tax collectors.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 5:46'>5:46</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 9:12'>9:12</a> <b>healthy … sick.</b> The Pharisees thought they were well—religiously pure and whole.

The Pharisees tended to focus on the outward, ritual, and ceremonial aspects of God’s law—to the neglect of its inward, eternal, and moral precepts. In doing so, they became harsh, judgmental, and self-righteously scornful of others.

This power was a preview of the power Christ will exhibit in His earthly kingdom, when Satan will be bound ( <a ref='Rev 20'>Rev 20</a> ) and the curse on physical life curtailed ( <a ref='Isaiah 65:20–25'>Is 65:20–25</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 10:2'>10:2</a> <b>the names of the twelve apostles.</b> The 12 are always listed in a similar order (cf. <a ref='Mark 3:16–19'>Mk 3:16–19</a> ; <a ref='Luke 6:13–16'>Lk 6:13–16</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:13'>Ac 1:13</a> ). Peter is always named first. The list contains 3 groups of 4.

If they sold these gifts for money, they could have made quite a fortune. But that would have obscured the message of grace Christ sent them to preach. So He forbade them to charge money for their ministry. Yet they were permitted to accept support to meet their basic needs, for a workman is worthy of such support (v. <a ref='Matthew 10:10'>10</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 10:9–10'>10:9–10</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 9:3'>Lk 9:3</a> .</i> The restrictions on what they were to carry were unique for this mission. See <a ref='Luke 22:36'>Lk 22:36</a> where, on a later mission, Christ gave completely different instructions. The point here was to teach them to trust the Lord to supply their needs through the generosity of the people to whom they ministered, and to teach those who received the blessing of their ministry to support the servants of Christ.

In other words, divine providence governs even the smallest details and even the most mundane matters. These are very powerful affirmations of the sovereignty of God. <a ref='Matthew 10:32'>10:32</a> <b>confesses Me.</b> The person who acknowledges Christ as Lord in life or in death, if necessary, is the one whom the Lord will acknowledge before God as His own. <i>See note on <a ref='2 Timothy 2:10–13'>2Ti 2:10–13</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 10:33'>10:33</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 12:9'>Lk 12:9</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 10:34'>10:34</a> <b>not … peace, but a sword.</b> Though the ultimate end of the gospel is peace with God ( <a ref='John 14:27'>Jn 14:27</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:6'>Ro 8:6</a> ), the immediate result of the gospel is frequently conflict. Conversion to Christ can result in strained family relationships (vv. <a ref='Matthew 10:35–36'>35–36</a> ), persecution, and even martyrdom. Following Christ presupposes a willingness to endure such hardships (vv. <a ref='Matthew 10:32–33'>32–33</a> , <a ref='Matthew 10:37–39'>37–39</a> ). Though He is called “Prince of Peace” ( <a ref='Isaiah 9:6'>Is 9:6</a> ), Christ will have no one deluded into thinking that He calls believers to a life devoid of all conflict. <a ref='Matthew 10:35–36'>10:35–36</a> Quoted from <a ref='Micah 7:6'>Mic 7:6</a> . <a ref='Matthew 10:38'>10:38</a> <b>take his cross.</b> Here is Jesus’ first mention of the word “cross” to His disciples ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 16:21'>16:21</a></i> ). To them it would have evoked a picture of a violent, degrading death ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 27:31'>27:31</a></i> ). He was demanding total commitment from them—even unto physical death—and making this call to full surrender a part of the message they were to proclaim to others. This same call to life-or-death devotion to Christ is repeated in <a ref='Matthew 16:24'>16:24</a> ; <a ref='Mark 8:34'>Mk 8:34</a> ; <a ref='Luke 9:23'>Lk 9:23</a> ; <a ref='Luke 14:27'>14:27</a> .

Meanwhile, the disciples were also ministering in the Jewish towns in and around Galilee ( <a ref='Matthew 10:5–6'>10:5–6</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 11:3'>11:3</a> <b>Are You the One who is to come, or shall we look for someone else?</b> John the Baptist had introduced Christ as One who would bring a fierce judgment and “burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire” ( <a ref='Matthew 3:12'>3:12</a> ). He was understandably confused by the turn of events: he was imprisoned, and Christ was carrying on a ministry of healing, not judgment, in Galilee, far from Jerusalem, the city of the King—and not finding a completely warm reception there (cf. <a ref='Matthew 8:34'>8:34</a> ). John wondered if he had misunderstood Jesus’ agenda. It would be wrong to interpret this as a wavering of his faith (v. <a ref='Matthew 11:7'>7</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 11:4'>11:4</a> <b>report to John.</b> He sent John’s disciples back as eyewitnesses of many miracles. Evidently, He performed these miracles in their presence just so that they could report back to John that they had personally seen proof that He was indeed the Messiah (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 29:18–19'>Is 29:18–19</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 35:5–10'>35:5–10</a> ). Note, however, that He offered no further explanation to John, knowing exactly how strong John’s faith was (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:13'>1Co 10:13</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 11:10'>11:10</a> Quoted from <a ref='Malachi 3:1'>Mal 3:1</a> . <a ref='Matthew 11:11'>11:11</a> <b>least … is greater than he.</b> John was greater than the OT prophets because he actually saw with his eyes and personally participated in the fulfillment of what they only prophesied (vv. <a ref='Matthew 11:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Matthew 11:13'>13</a> ; cf. <a ref='1 Peter 1:10–11'>1Pe 1:10–11</a> ). But all believers after the cross are greater still, because they participate in the full understanding and experience of something John merely foresaw in shadowy form—the actual atoning work of Christ. <a ref='Matthew 11:12'>11:12</a> <b>the kingdom of heaven suffers violence.</b> From the time he began his preaching ministry, John the Baptist evoked a strong reaction. Having been imprisoned already, John ultimately fell victim to Herod’s savagery. But the kingdom can never be subdued or opposed by human violence. Notice that where Matthew says, the “violent men take it by force,” Luke has, “everyone forcing his way into it” ( <a ref='Luke 16:16'>Lk 16:16</a> ). So the sense of this verse may be rendered this way: “The kingdom presses ahead relentlessly, and only the relentless press their way into it.” Thus again Christ is magnifying the difficulty of entering the kingdom ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 7:13–14'>7:13–14</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 11:14'>11:14</a> <b>John himself is Elijah.</b> I.e., he is the fulfillment of <a ref='Malachi 4:5–6'>Mal 4:5–6</a> (see <a ref='Matthew 17:12–13'>17:12–13</a> ). The Jews were aware that Elijah had not died (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 2:11'>2Ki 2:11</a> ). This does not suggest that John was Elijah returned. In fact, John himself denied that he was Elijah ( <a ref='John 1:21'>Jn 1:21</a> ); yet he came in the spirit and power of Elijah ( <a ref='Luke 1:17'>Lk 1:17</a> ). If they had believed, John would have been the fulfillment of the Elijah prophecies. <i>See notes on <a ref='Mark 9:13'>Mk 9:13</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:5–6'>Rev 11:5–6</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 11:16'>11:16</a> <b>like children.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 7:32'>Lk 7:32</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 11:19'>11:19</a> <b>eating and drinking.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 7:34'>Lk 7:34</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 11:21'>11:21</a> <b>Woe to you, Chorazin! … Bethsaida!</b> Both were cities very close to Capernaum, near the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee. <b>Tyre … Sidon.</b> Phoenician cities on the shore of the Mediterranean.

Curiously, there is no record that the people of that city ever mocked or ridiculed Jesus, ran Him out of town, or threatened His life. Yet the sin of that city—indifference to Christ—was worse than Sodom’s gross wickedness (cf. <a ref='Matthew 10:15'>10:15</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 11:25'>11:25</a> <b>wise and intelligent … infants.</b> There is sarcasm in these words as the Jewish leaders are ironically identified as wise and intelligent and the followers of Christ as the infants (cf. <a ref='Matthew 18:3–10'>18:3–10</a> )—yet God has revealed to those followers the truth of the Messiah and His gospel. Cf. <a ref='Matthew 13:10–17'>13:10–17</a> . <a ref='Matthew 11:26'>11:26</a> <b>this way was well-pleasing in Your sight.</b> Cf. <a ref='Luke 10:21–22'>Lk 10:21–22</a> . This is a powerful affirmation of the sovereignty of God over all the affairs of men; and in the verse that follows, Christ claimed that the task of executing the divine will had been committed to Him—a claim that would be utterly blasphemous if Jesus were anything less than sovereign God Himself. <a ref='Matthew 11:28–30'>11:28–30</a> <b>Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden.</b> There is an echo of the first beatitude ( <a ref='Matthew 5:3'>5:3</a> ) in this passage. Note that this is an open invitation to all who hear—but phrased in such a way that the only ones who will respond to the invitation are those who are burdened by their own spiritual bankruptcy and the weight of trying to save themselves by keeping the law. The stubbornness of humanity’s sinful rebellion is such that without a sovereignly bestowed spiritual awakening, all sinners refuse to acknowledge the depth of their spiritual poverty. That is why, as Jesus says in v. <a ref='Matthew 11:27'>27</a> , our salvation is the sovereign work of God. But the truth of divine election in v. <a ref='Matthew 11:27'>27</a> is not incompatible with the free offer to all in vv. <a ref='Matthew 11:28–30'>28–30</a> . <a ref='Matthew 11:29'>11:29</a> you will find rest <b>.</b> I.e., from the endless, fruitless effort to save oneself by the works of the law (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 4:1–3'>Heb 4:1–3</a> , <a ref='Hebrews 4:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Hebrews 4:9–11'>9–11</a> ). This speaks of a permanent respite in the grace of God which is apart from works (v. <a ref='Matthew 11:30'>30</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 12:2'>12:2</a> <b>not lawful to do on a Sabbath.</b> Actually, no law prohibited the plucking of grain in order to eat on the Sabbath. Gleaning handfuls of grain from a neighbor’s field to satisfy one’s immediate hunger was explicitly permitted ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:25'>Dt 23:25</a> ). What was prohibited was labor for the sake of profit. Thus a farmer could not harvest for profit on the Sabbath, but an individual could glean enough grain to eat. <a ref='Matthew 12:3'>12:3</a> <b>He said.</b> Jesus’ answer in vv. <a ref='Matthew 12:3–8'>3–8</a> points out that the Sabbath laws do not restrict deeds of necessity (vv. <a ref='Matthew 12:3–4'>3–4</a> ); service to God (vv. <a ref='Matthew 12:5–6'>5–6</a> ); or acts of mercy (vv. <a ref='Matthew 12:7–8'>7–8</a> ). He reaffirmed that the Sabbath was made for man’s benefit and God’s glory. It was never intended to be a yoke of bondage to the people of God ( <a ref='Mark 2:27'>Mk 2:27</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 6:9'>Lk 6:9</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 12:4'>12:4</a> <b>the consecrated bread.</b> The consecrated bread of the Presence, 12 loaves baked fresh each Sabbath, which was usually eaten by the priests only ( <a ref='Leviticus 24:5–9'>Lv 24:5–9</a> ).

Again, this was an inescapable claim of deity—and as such it prompted the Pharisees’ violent outrage (v. <a ref='Matthew 12:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 12:10'>12:10</a> <b>Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?</b> Jewish tradition prohibited the practice of medicine on the Sabbath, except in life-threatening situations. But no actual law in the OT forbade the giving of medicine, healing, or any other acts of mercy on the Sabbath. It is always lawful to do good. <a ref='Matthew 12:15'>12:15</a> <b>He healed them all.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 9:35'>9:35</a> .</i> In all of OT history there was never a time or a person who exhibited such extensive healing power. Physical healings were very rare in the OT. Christ chose to display His deity by healing, raising the dead, and liberating people from demons. That not only showed the Messiah’s power over the physical and spiritual realms, but also demonstrated the compassion of God toward those affected by sin. <i>See note on <a ref='John 11:35'>Jn 11:35</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 12:16'>12:16</a> <b>warned them not to make Him known.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 8:4'>8:4</a> .</i> Here Christ seems concerned about the potential zealotry of those who would try to press Him into the conquering-hero mold that the rabbinical experts had made out of messianic prophecy ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 12:18'>18</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 12:18'>12:18</a> Behold, My Servant <b>.</b> Verses <a ref='Matthew 12:18–21'>18–21</a> are quoted from <a ref='Isaiah 42:1–4'>Is 42:1–4</a> , to demonstrate that (contrary to the typical first-century rabbinical expectations) the Messiah would not arrive with political agendas, military campaigns, and great fanfare, but with gentleness and meekness—declaring righteousness even “to the Gentiles.” <a ref='Matthew 12:19'>12:19</a> not quarrel, nor cry out <b>.</b> The Messiah would not try to stir up a revolution or force His way into power. <a ref='Matthew 12:20'>12:20</a> battered reed … smoldering wick <b>.</b> The reed was used by shepherds to fashion a small musical instrument. Once cracked or worn, it was useless. A smoldering wick was also useless for giving light. These represent people who are deemed useless by the world. Christ’s work was to restore and rekindle such people, not to “break” them. This speaks of His tender compassion toward the lowliest of the lost. He came not to gather the strong for a revolution, but to show mercy to the weak. Cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:26–29'>1Co 1:26–29</a> . <a ref='Matthew 12:23'>12:23</a> <b>Son of David.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 1:1'>1:1</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 12:24'>12:24</a> <b>Beelzebul.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 10:25'>10:25</a> .</i> After all the displays of Jesus’ deity, the Pharisees declared that He was from Satan—exactly opposite the truth, and they knew it ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 12:31'>31</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 9:34'>9:34</a> ; <a ref='Mark 3:22'>Mk 3:22</a> ; <a ref='Luke 11:15'>Lk 11:15</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 12:28'>12:28</a> <b>kingdom of God has come.</b> That was precisely true. The King was in their midst, displaying His sovereign power. He showed it by demonstrating His ability to bind Satan and his demons (v. <a ref='Matthew 12:29'>29</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 12:31'>12:31</a> <b>blasphemy against the Spirit.</b> The sin He was confronting was the Pharisees’ deliberate rejection of that which they knew to be of God (cf. <a ref='John 11:48'>Jn 11:48</a> ; <a ref='Acts 4:16'>Ac 4:16</a> ). They could not deny the reality of what the Holy Spirit had done through Him, so they attributed to Satan a work that they knew was of God (v. <a ref='Matthew 12:24'>24</a> ; <a ref='Mark 3:22'>Mk 3:22</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 12:32'>12:32</a> <b>it shall be forgiven him.</b> Someone never exposed to Christ’s divine power and presence might reject Him in ignorance and be forgiven—assuming the unbelief gives way to genuine repentance. Even a Pharisee such as Saul of Tarsus could be forgiven for speaking against Jesus or persecuting His followers—because his unbelief stemmed from ignorance ( <a ref='1 Timothy 1:13'>1Ti 1:13</a> ). But those who know His claims are true and reject Him anyway sin “against the Holy Spirit”—because it is the Holy Spirit who testifies of Christ and makes His truth known to us ( <a ref='John 15:26'>Jn 15:26</a> ; <a ref='John 16:14–15'>16:14–15</a> ). No forgiveness was possible for these Pharisees who witnessed His miracles firsthand, knew the truth of His claims, and still blasphemed the Holy Spirit—because they had already rejected the fullest possible revelation. <i>See notes on <a ref='Hebrews 6:4–6'>Heb 6:4–6</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:29'>10:29</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 12:36'>12:36</a> <b>every careless word.</b> The most seemingly insignificant sin—even a slip of the tongue—carries the full potential of all hell’s evil (cf. <a ref='James 3:6'>Jas 3:6</a> ). No infraction against God’s holiness is therefore a trifling thing, and each person will ultimately give account of every such indiscretion. There is no truer indication of a bad tree than the bad fruit of speech (vv. <a ref='Matthew 12:33'>33</a> , <a ref='Matthew 12:35'>35</a> ). The poisonous snakes were known by their poisonous mouths revealing evil hearts (v. <a ref='Matthew 12:34'>34</a> ; cf. <a ref='Luke 6:45'>Lk 6:45</a> ). Every person is judged by his words, because they reveal the state of his heart. <a ref='Matthew 12:38'>12:38</a> <b>we want to see a sign from You.</b> They were hoping for a sign of astronomical proportions ( <a ref='Luke 11:16'>Lk 11:16</a> ). Instead, He gives them a “sign” from Scripture. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 16:1'>16:1</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 21:21'>21:21</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 12:39'>12:39</a> <b>An evil and adulterous generation.</b> This speaks of spiritual adultery—unfaithfulness to God (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 5:7–8'>Jer 5:7–8</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 12:40'>12:40</a> three days and three nights <b>.</b> Quoted from <a ref='Jonah 1:17'>Jon 1:17</a> . This sort of expression was a common way of underscoring the prophetic significance of a period of time. An expression like “forty days and forty nights” ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 4:2'>4:2</a></i> ) may in some cases simply refer to a period of time longer than a month. “Three days and three nights” was an emphatic way of saying “three days,” and by Jewish reckoning this would be an apt way of expressing a period of time that includes parts of 3 days. Thus, if Christ was crucified on a Friday, and His resurrection occurred on the first day of the week, by Hebrew reckoning this would qualify as 3 days and 3 nights. All sorts of elaborate schemes have been devised to suggest that Christ might have died on a Wednesday or Thursday, just to accommodate the extreme literal meaning of these words. But the original meaning would not have required that sort of wooden interpretation. <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 13:32'>Lk 13:32</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 12:41'>12:41</a> <b>men of Nineveh … repented.</b> <i>See <a ref='Jonah 3:5–10'>Jon 3:5–10</a> .</i> The revival in Nineveh under Jonah’s preaching was one of the most extraordinary spiritual revivals the world has ever seen. Some have suggested that the repentance of the Ninevites stopped short of saving faith, because the city reverted within one generation to its old pagan ways (cf. <a ref='Nahum 3:7–8'>Na 3:7–8</a> ). From Jesus’ words here, however, it is clear that the revival under Jonah represented authentic saving conversions. Only eternity will reveal how many souls from that one generation were swept into the kingdom as a result of the revival. <a ref='Matthew 12:42'>12:42</a> <b>Queen of the South.</b> See <a ref='1 Kings 10:1–13'>1Ki 10:1–13</a> . The queen of Sheba came to see Solomon’s glory ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 6:29'>6:29</a></i> ) and in the process encountered the glory of Solomon’s God ( <a ref='1 Kings 10:9'>1Ki 10:9</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 12:45'>12:45</a> <b>the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.</b> The problem is that the evil spirit found the house “unoccupied” (v. <a ref='Matthew 12:44'>44</a> ). This is the description of someone who attempts moral reform without ever being indwelt by the Holy Spirit. Reform apart from regeneration is never effective and eventually reverts back to prereform behavior. <a ref='Matthew 12:46'>12:46</a> <b>brothers.</b> These are actual siblings (half-brothers) of Jesus. Matthew explicitly connects them with Mary, indicating that they were not cousins or Joseph’s sons from a previous marriage, as some of the church fathers imagined. They are mentioned in all the Gospels ( <a ref='Mark 3:31'>Mk 3:31</a> ; <a ref='Luke 8:19–21'>Lk 8:19–21</a> ; <a ref='John 7:3–5'>Jn 7:3–5</a> ). Matthew and Mark give the names of 4 of Jesus’ brothers, and mention that He had sisters as well ( <a ref='Matthew 13:55'>13:55</a> ; <a ref='Mark 6:3'>Mk 6:3</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 12:48–49'>12:48–49</a> Jesus was not repudiating His earthly family (cf. <a ref='John 19:26–27'>Jn 19:26–27</a> ). Rather, He was emphasizing the supremacy and eternality of spiritual relationships (cf. <a ref='Matthew 10:37'>10:37</a> ). After all, even His own family needed Him as Savior (cf. <a ref='John 7:5'>Jn 7:5</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 12:50'>12:50</a> <b>does the will of My Father.</b> This is not salvation by works. Doing the will of God is the evidence of salvation by grace. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 7:21–27'>7:21–27</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 13:1–52'>13:1–52</a> This is the third of 5 discourses featured in Matthew (see Introduction: Historical and Theological Themes ). <a ref='Matthew 13:3'>13:3</a> <b>parables.</b> Parables were a common form of teaching in Judaism. The Greek term for “parable” appears 45 times in the LXX. A parable is a long analogy, often cast in the form of a story. Before this point in His ministry, Jesus had employed many graphic analogies (cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:13–16'>5:13–16</a> ), but their meaning was fairly clear in the context of His teaching. Parables required more explanation (cf. v. <a ref='Matthew 13:36'>36</a> ) and Jesus employed them to obscure the truth from unbelievers while making it clearer to His disciples (vv. <a ref='Matthew 13:11–12'>11–12</a> ). For the remainder of His Galilean ministry, He did not speak to the multitudes except in parables (v. <a ref='Matthew 13:34'>34</a> ). Jesus’ veiling the truth from unbelievers this way was both an act of judgment and an act of mercy. It was “judgment” because it kept them in the darkness that they loved (cf. <a ref='John 3:19'>Jn 3:19</a> ), but it was “mercy” because they had already rejected the light, so any exposure to more truth would only increase their condemnation. <i>See note on v. <a ref='Matthew 13:13'>13</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 13:4'>13:4</a> <b>beside the road.</b> The fields were bordered by paths beaten hard by foot traffic and baking sun. <a ref='Matthew 13:5'>13:5</a> <b>rocky places.</b> Very shallow soil atop a layer of bedrock.

The reprobate ones, on the other hand, are passed over. They reap the natural consequence of their own unbelief and rebellion—spiritual blindness (v. <a ref='Matthew 13:13'>13</a> ). <b>the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.</b> “Mysteries” are those truths which have been hidden from all ages in the past and revealed in the NT. <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:7'>1Co 2:7</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 4:1'>4:1</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 3:4–5'>Eph 3:4–5</a> .</i> Many specific doctrines of the NT are identified as “mysteries” (e.g., <a ref='Romans 11:25'>Ro 11:25</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:51'>1Co 15:51</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:32'>Eph 5:32</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 6:19'>6:19</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:26–27'>Col 1:26–27</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:7'>2Th 2:7</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 3:9'>1Ti 3:9</a> , <a ref='1 Timothy 3:16'>16</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 13:13'>13:13</a> <b>because while seeing they do not see.</b> Here Matthew seems to suggest that their own unbelief is the cause of their spiritual blindness. <a ref='Luke 8:10'>Luke 8:10</a> , however, emphasizes God’s initiative in obscuring the truth from these unbelievers (“to the rest <i>it is</i> in parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand ”—cf. <a ref='Isaiah 6:9'>Is 6:9</a> ). Both things are true, of course.

They make the leaven some evil influence inside the kingdom. But that twists Jesus’ actual words and violates the context, in which Jesus is repeatedly describing that kingdom itself as the pervading influence. <a ref='Matthew 13:34'>13:34</a> <b>He was not speaking to them without a parable.</b> For the rest of His Galilean ministry, all Jesus’ public teaching consisted only of parables. <a ref='Matthew 13:35'>13:35</a> <b>spoken through the prophet.</b> The “prophet” in this case was the psalmist.

The most sinister influence of the Jewish leaders was a pragmatic doctrine that made room for hypocrisy. They were too concerned with externals and ceremonies and the way things appeared, and not concerned enough with matters of the heart. Jesus rebuked them for their hypocrisy again and again. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 23:25'>23:25</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 16:13'>16:13</a> <b>Caesarea Philippi.</b> A district about 25 mi. north of Galilee, at the base of Mt.

Never before had He explicitly taught Peter and the apostles the fullness of His identity. God the Father had opened Peter’s eyes to the full significance of those claims, and revealed to him who Jesus really was. In other words, God had opened Peter’s heart to this deeper knowledge of Christ by faith. Peter was not merely expressing an academic opinion about the identity of Christ; this was a confession of Peter’s personal faith, made possible by a divinely regenerated heart. <a ref='Matthew 16:18'>16:18</a> <b>upon this rock.</b> The word for “Peter,” <i>Petros</i> , means a small stone ( <a ref='John 1:42'>Jn 1:42</a> ). Jesus used a play on words here with <i>petra</i> , which means a foundation boulder (cf. <a ref='Matthew 7:24–25'>7:24–25</a> ). Since the NT makes it abundantly clear that Christ is both the foundation ( <a ref='Acts 4:11–12'>Ac 4:11–12</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:11'>1Co 3:11</a> ), and the head ( <a ref='Ephesians 5:23'>Eph 5:23</a> ) of the church, it is a mistake to think that here He is giving either of those roles to Peter. There is a sense in which the apostles played a foundational role in the building of the church ( <a ref='Ephesians 2:20'>Eph 2:20</a> ), but the role of primacy is reserved for Christ alone, not assigned to Peter. So Jesus’ words here are best interpreted as a simple play on words in that a boulder-like truth came from the mouth of one who was called a small stone. Peter himself explains the imagery in his first epistle: the church is built of “living stones” ( <a ref='1 Peter 2:5'>1Pe 2:5</a> ) who, like Peter, confess that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Christ Himself is the “corner stone” ( <a ref='1 Peter 2:6–7'>1Pe 2:6–7</a> ). <b>church.</b> Matthew is the only Gospel where this term is found (see also <a ref='Matthew 18:17'>18:17</a> ). Christ called it “My church,” emphasizing that He alone is its Architect, Builder, Owner, and Lord. The Greek word for church means “called out ones.” While God had since the beginning of redemptive history been gathering the redeemed by grace, the unique church He promised to build began at Pentecost with the coming of the Holy Spirit, by whom the Lord baptized believers into His body—which is the church ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Acts 2:1–4'>Ac 2:1–4</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:12–13'>1Co 12:12–13</a></i> ). <b>the gates of Hades.</b> Hades is the place of punishment for the spirits of dead unbelievers. The point of entry for such is death. This, then, is a Jewish phrase referring to death. Even death, the ultimate weapon of Satan (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 2:14–15'>Heb 2:14–15</a> ), has no power to stop the church. The blood of martyrs, in fact, has sped the growth of the church in size and spiritual power. <a ref='Matthew 16:19'>16:19</a> <b>the keys of the kingdom of heaven.</b> These represent authority, and here Christ gives Peter (and by extension all other believers) authority to declare what was bound or loosed in heaven. This echoed the promise of <a ref='John 20:23'>Jn 20:23</a> , where Christ gave the disciples authority to forgive or retain the sins of people. All this must be understood in the context of <a ref='Matthew 18:15–17'>18:15–17</a> , where Christ laid out specific instructions for dealing with sin in the church ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 18:15'>18:15</a></i> ). The sum of it all means that any duly constituted body of believers, acting in accord with God’s Word, has the authority to declare if someone is forgiven or unforgiven. The church’s authority is not to determine these things, but to declare the judgment of heaven based on the principles of the Word. When they make such judgments on the basis of God’s Word, they can be sure heaven is in accord. In other words, whatever they “bind” or “loose” on earth is already “bound” or “loosed” in heaven. When the church says the unrepentant person is bound in sin, the church is saying what God says about that person. When the church acknowledges that a repentant person has been loosed from that sin, God agrees. <a ref='Matthew 16:20'>16:20</a> <b>tell no one.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 8:4'>8:4</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 12:16'>12:16</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 16:21'>16:21</a> <b>From that time.</b> This marks the beginning of a new emphasis in Matthew’s account. He turns his attention from Jesus’ public ministry to His private instructions for the disciples which took on a new, somber tone. The disciples had confessed their faith in Him as Messiah. From then on, He began to prepare them for His death. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 20:19'>20:19</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 16:23'>16:23</a> <b>Get behind Me, Satan!</b> The harshness of this rebuke contrasts sharply with Christ’s words of commendation in vv. <a ref='Matthew 16:17–19'>17–19</a> . Jesus suggested that Peter was being a mouthpiece for Satan. Jesus’ death was part of God’s sovereign plan ( <a ref='Acts 2:23'>Ac 2:23</a> ; <a ref='Acts 4:27–28'>4:27–28</a> ). “Yahweh was pleased to crush Him” ( <a ref='Isaiah 53:10'>Is 53:10</a> ). Christ had come with the express purpose of dying as an atonement for sin ( <a ref='John 12:27'>Jn 12:27</a> ). And those who would thwart His mission were doing Satan’s work. <a ref='Matthew 16:24'>16:24</a> <b>take up his cross.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 10:38'>10:38</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 16:26'>16:26</a> <b>exchange.</b> At the judgment when he faces the disastrous hell of remorse and suffering for his lost soul, with what will he buy it back from perdition?

Here, however, the Lord was concerned with the reward of the ungodly—final and eternal judgment ( <a ref='Romans 2:5–11'>Ro 2:5–11</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:6–10'>2Th 1:6–10</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 16:28'>16:28</a> <b>some … standing.</b> In all 3 of the Synoptic Gospels, this promise is made immediately prior to the Transfiguration ( <a ref='Mark 9:1–8'>Mk 9:1–8</a> ; <a ref='Luke 9:27–36'>Lk 9:27–36</a> ). Furthermore the word for “kingdom” can be translated “royal splendor.” Therefore, it seems most natural to interpret this promise as a reference to the Transfiguration, which “some” of the disciples—Peter, James, and John would witness only 6 days later ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 17:1'>17:1</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 17:1'>17:1</a> <b>six days later.</b> The precise reference to the amount of time elapsed is unusual for Matthew. It seems he is carefully drawing the connection between Jesus’ promise in <a ref='Matthew 16:28'>16:28</a> and the event that immediately follows. Mark agrees on the figure of 6 days ( <a ref='Mark 9:2'>Mk 9:2</a> ), but Luke, probably counting the day of Peter’s confession and the day of Christ’s Transfiguration separately at the start and end of this time period, says it was “some eight days” ( <a ref='Luke 9:28'>Lk 9:28</a> ). <b>Peter and James and John.</b> These 3, in the inner circle closest to Christ ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 10:2'>10:2</a></i> ), are often seen alone together with Jesus ( <a ref='Matthew 26:37'>26:37</a> ; <a ref='Mark 5:37'>Mk 5:37</a> ; <a ref='Mark 13:3'>13:3</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 17:2'>17:2</a> <b>transfigured.</b> Christ underwent a dramatic change in appearance, so the disciples could behold Him in His glory. <a ref='Matthew 17:3'>17:3</a> <b>Moses and Elijah.</b> Representing the Law and the prophets respectively, both of which had foretold Christ’s death, and that is what Luke says the 3 of them were discussing ( <a ref='Luke 9:31'>Lk 9:31</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 17:4'>17:4</a> <b>three booths.</b> This is undoubtedly a reference to the booths that were used to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles, when the Israelites dwelt in booths for 7 days ( <a ref='Leviticus 23:34–42'>Lv 23:34–42</a> ).

Less than a year later, they failed where they had once succeeded. Christ’s explanation for their failure was that their faith was deficient (v. <a ref='Matthew 17:20'>20</a> ). The deficiency did not consist in a lack of confidence; they were surprised that they could not cast out this demon. The problem probably lay in a failure to make God—rather than their own gifts—the object of their confidence ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 17:20'>20</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 17:20'>17:20</a> <b>faith the size of a mustard seed.</b> True faith, by Christ’s definition, always involves surrender to the will of God. What He was teaching here is nothing like positive-thinking psychology. He was saying that both the source and the object of all genuine faith—even the weak, mustard-seed variety—is God. And “nothing will be impossible with God” ( <a ref='Luke 1:37'>Lk 1:37</a> ). <i>See also note on <a ref='Matthew 21:21'>21:21</a> .</i> <b>nothing will be impossible.</b> Here, Christ assumes the qualifying thought that is explicitly added by <a ref='1 John 5:14'>1Jn 5:14</a> : what we ask for must be “according to His will.” <a ref='Matthew 17:21'>17:21</a> <b>except by prayer and fasting.</b> Again, this suggests that the underlying problem was the disciples’ failure to make God the object of their faith ( <i>see notes on vv. <a ref='Matthew 17:19–20'>19–20</a></i> ).

As kings did not tax their own sons, technically, Jesus, as God’s Son, was exempt from the tax (v. <a ref='Matthew 17:26'>26</a> ). But to avoid offense, He paid on behalf of Himself and Peter (v. <a ref='Matthew 17:27'>27</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Romans 13:1–7'>Ro 13:1–7</a> ; <a ref='Titus 3:1'>Tit 3:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:13–17'>1Pe 2:13–17</a> . <a ref='Matthew 18:1–35'>18:1–35</a> This is the fourth of 5 discourses around which Matthew frames his narrative (see Introduction: Historical and Theological Themes ). This section’s theme is the childlikeness of the believer. <a ref='Matthew 18:3'>18:3</a> <b>become like children.</b> This is how Jesus characterized conversion. Like the Beatitudes, it pictures faith as the simple, helpless, trusting dependence of those who have no resources of their own. Like children, they have no achievements and no accomplishments to offer or commend themselves with. <a ref='Matthew 18:5'>18:5</a> <b>whoever receives.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 10:41'>10:41</a> .</i> <b>one such child.</b> This speaks not of literal children, but children in the sense described in vv. <a ref='Matthew 18:3–4'>3–4</a> (those who have humbled themselves like children), i.e., true believers (v. <a ref='Matthew 18:6'>6</a> ). <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 10:42'>10:42</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 19:14'>19:14</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 18:6'>18:6</a> <b>millstone.</b> A stone used for grinding grain. Lit. “the millstone of an ass”—a stone so large it took a donkey to turn it. <a ref='Matthew 18:7'>18:7</a> <b>Woe to the world.</b> It is expected that those in the world will cause Christians to be offended, stumble and sin, and they will be judged for it. But it should not be that fellow believers lead others into sin, directly or indirectly. One would be better off dead. Cf. <a ref='Romans 14:13'>Ro 14:13</a> , <a ref='Romans 14:19'>19</a> , <a ref='Romans 14:21'>21</a> ; <a ref='Romans 15:2'>15:2</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 8:13'>1Co 8:13</a> . <a ref='Matthew 18:8–9'>18:8–9</a> <b>cut it off … tear it out.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 5:29'>5:29</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 18:10'>18:10</a> <b>do not despise.</b> I.e., spurn or belittle another believer by treating him or her unkindly or indifferently. <b>their angels.</b> This does not suggest that each believer has a personal guardian angel. Rather, the pronoun is collective and refers to the fact that believers are served by angels in general. These angels are pictured “continually” watching the face of God so as to hear His command to them to help a believer when needed. It is extremely serious to treat any fellow believer with contempt since God and the holy angels are so concerned for their well-being. <a ref='Matthew 18:14'>18:14</a> <b>perish.</b> The word here can (and does in this context) refer to spiritual devastation rather than utter eternal destruction. This does not suggest that God’s children ever could perish in the ultimate sense (cf. <a ref='John 10:28'>Jn 10:28</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 18:15'>18:15</a> The prescription for church discipline in vv. <a ref='Matthew 18:15–17'>15–17</a> must be read in light of the parable of the lost sheep in vv. <a ref='Matthew 18:12–14'>12–14</a> . The goal of this process is restoration. If successful, “you have won your brother.” Step 1 is to “show him his fault” privately. <a ref='Matthew 18:16'>18:16</a> <b>if he does not listen.</b> I.e., if he remains impenitent, follow step 2: “take one or two more with you,” to fulfill the principle of <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:15'>Dt 19:15</a> . <a ref='Matthew 18:17'>18:17</a> <b>tell it to the church.</b> If he still refuses to repent, step 3 requires that the matter be reported to the whole assembly (v. <a ref='Matthew 18:17'>17</a> )—so that all may lovingly pursue the sinning brother’s reconciliation. But failing that, step 4 means that the offender must be excommunicated, regarded by the church as “the Gentile and the tax collector” ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 5:46'>5:46</a></i> ). The idea is not merely to punish the offender, or to shun him completely, but to remove him as a detrimental influence from the fellowship of the church, and henceforth to regard him as an evangelistic prospect rather than as a brother. Ultimately, the sin for which he is excommunicated is a hard-hearted impenitence. <a ref='Matthew 18:18'>18:18</a> <b>bind on earth … bound in heaven.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 16:19'>16:19</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 18:19'>18:19</a> <b>if two of you agree on earth.</b> This promise applies to the issue of discipline discussed in vv. <a ref='Matthew 18:15–17'>15–17</a> . The “two of you” spoken of here harks back to the two or three witnesses involved in step two of the discipline process ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 18:15'>15</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 18:20'>18:20</a> <b>two or three.</b> Jewish tradition requires at least 10 men (a <i>minyan</i> ) to constitute a synagogue or even hold public prayer. Here, Christ promised to be present in the midst of an even smaller flock—“two or three” gathered in His name for the purpose of discipline ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 18:15'>15</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 18:21'>18:21</a> <b>Up to seven times?</b> Peter thought he was being magnanimous. The rabbis, citing several verses from Amos ( <a ref='Amos 1:3'>1:3</a> , <a ref='Amos 1:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Amos 1:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Amos 1:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Amos 1:13'>13</a> ) taught that since God forgave Israel’s enemies only 3 times, it was presumptuous and unnecessary to forgive anyone more than 3 times. <a ref='Matthew 18:22'>18:22</a> <b>seventy times seven.</b> Innumerable times. <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 17:4'>Lk 17:4</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 18:23'>18:23</a> <b>slaves.</b> Due to the large amounts of money involved, it is likely these “slaves” would have been provincial governors who owed the king the money from taxation. <a ref='Matthew 18:24'>18:24</a> <b>ten thousand talents.</b> This represents an incomprehensible amount of money. The talent was the largest denomination of currency, and “ten thousand” in common parlance signified an infinite number. <a ref='Matthew 18:25'>18:25</a> <b>commanded him to be sold.</b> A way to recover some of this loss was for the king to sell the family members into slavery. <a ref='Matthew 18:27'>18:27</a> <b>forgave him.</b> Picturing the generous, compassionate forgiveness of God to a pleading sinner who owes Him an unpayable debt. Cf. <a ref='Colossians 2:14'>Col 2:14</a> . <a ref='Matthew 18:28'>18:28</a> <b>one hundred denarii.</b> About 3 months’ wages. This was not a negligible amount by normal standards, but it was a pittance in comparison to what the slave had been forgiven. <a ref='Matthew 18:29'>18:29</a> <b>Have patience. … will repay you.</b> Cf. v. <a ref='Matthew 18:26'>26</a> . The forgiven man heard the same pleading he had given before his master, but was utterly without compassion (v. <a ref='Matthew 18:30'>30</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 18:31'>18:31</a> <b>fellow slaves … grieved.</b> A lack of forgiveness is offensive to fellow believers. Most of all it offends God, who chastens His unforgiving children severely (vv. <a ref='Matthew 18:32–34'>32–34</a> ). <i>See notes on v. <a ref='Matthew 18:34'>34</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 6:15'>6:15</a> . <a ref='Matthew 18:34'>18:34</a> <b>his lord, moved with anger.</b> Because He is holy and just, God is always angry at sin, including the sins of His children (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 12:5–11'>Heb 12:5–11</a> ). <b>torturers.</b> Not executioners. This pictures severe discipline, not final condemnation. <b>all that was owed him.</b> The original debt was unpayable and the man was still without resources. So it seems unlikely that the slave was saddled once again with the same debt he had already been forgiven. Rather, what he now owed his master would be exacted in chastening by his master until he was willing to forgive others. <a ref='Matthew 19:1'>19:1</a> <b>the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.</b> Perea was the name of the region just east of the Jordan River. It was not technically part of Judea, but the territory ruled by Herod the Great had included both regions, and it was commonly referred to this way. Christ’s ministry in Perea lasted only a few months. It was from here that He would make His final journey to Jerusalem just prior to the Passion Week ( <a ref='Matthew 20:17–19'>20:17–19</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 19:3'>19:3</a> <b>Is it lawful.</b> A hotly debated difference of opinion existed between the Rabbis Shammai and Hillel (both near-contemporaries of Christ). The Shammaites interpreted the law rigidly, and permitted a man to divorce his wife only if she was guilty of sexual immorality. <b>for any reason at all?</b> The Hillelites took a wholly pragmatic approach, and permitted a man to divorce his wife indiscriminately. <a ref='Matthew 19:4'>19:4</a> Quoted from <a ref='Genesis 1:27'>Ge 1:27</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 5:2'>5:2</a> . <a ref='Matthew 19:5'>19:5</a> Quoted from <a ref='Genesis 2:24'>Ge 2:24</a> ( <i>see note there</i> ). <a ref='Matthew 19:7'>19:7</a> <b>Why then did Moses command to</b> give her a certificate of divorce <b>… ?</b> The Pharisees misrepresented <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:1–4'>Dt 24:1–4</a> . It was not a “command” for divorce, but a limitation on remarriage in the event of a divorce. While recognizing the legitimacy of divorce when a man “has found some indecency” ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:1'>Dt 24:1</a> ) in his wife (sexual sin, by Jesus’ interpretation in v. <a ref='Matthew 19:9'>9</a> ), Moses did not “command” divorce. <i>See note on <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:1–4'>Dt 24:1–4</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 19:8'>19:8</a> <b>Because of your hardness of heart.</b> The phrase underscores the truth that divorce is only a last-resort response to hard-hearted sexual immorality (v. <a ref='Matthew 19:9'>9</a> ). <b>Moses permitted you to divorce.</b> The stress is certainly on the word “permitted.” Thus Jesus clearly sides with the Shammai school of interpretation ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 19:3'>3</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 19:9'>19:9</a> <b>immorality.</b> This is a term that encompasses all sorts of sexual sins. Both here and in <a ref='Matthew 5:32'>5:32</a> , Jesus includes this “exception clause,” clearly permitting the innocent party in such a divorce to remarry without incurring the stigma of one who “commits adultery.” <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 5:31–32'>5:31–32</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 19:10'>19:10</a> <b>it is better not to marry.</b> The disciples correctly understood the binding nature of marriage, and that Jesus was setting a very high standard, permitting divorce only in the most extreme of circumstances. <a ref='Matthew 19:12'>19:12</a> <b>let him accept</b> it <b>.</b> Since all cannot handle it (v. <a ref='Matthew 19:11'>11</a> ), Christ is not enjoining celibacy here. Rather, He makes it entirely a matter of personal choice—except for those who are physically unable to marry, either through natural causes or because of the violence of other men. Still others may find there are pragmatic reasons not to marry for the good of the kingdom ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Corinthians 7:7–9'>1Co 7:7–9</a></i> ). But in no way did Christ suggest that celibacy is superior to marriage (cf. <a ref='Genesis 2:18'>Ge 2:18</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 4:3'>1Ti 4:3</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 19:14'>19:14</a> <b>such as these.</b> These children were too young to have exercised personal faith. See <a ref='Luke 18:15'>Lk 18:15</a> , where Luke refers to them as “babies.” Therefore, it is all the more significant that Christ used them as an illustration of those who make up “the kingdom of heaven” (cf. <a ref='Matthew 18:1–4'>18:1–4</a> ). <a ref='Mark 10:16'>Mk 10:16</a> also says He “blessed them.” God often shows a special mercy to those who because of age or mental deficiency are incapable of either faith or willful unbelief (cf. <a ref='Jonah 4:11'>Jon 4:11</a> ). They are called “innocent” in <a ref='Jeremiah 19:4'>Jer 19:4</a> . This does not mean they are free from the inherited guilt and moral corruption of Adam’s sin ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 5:12–19'>Ro 5:12–19</a></i> ), but rather that they are not culpable in the same sense as those whose sins are premeditated and deliberate. Jesus’ words here suggest that God’s mercy is graciously extended to infants so that those who die are sovereignly regenerated and granted entrance into the kingdom—not because they are deserving of heaven, but because God in His grace chooses to redeem them. <i>See notes on <a ref='2 Samuel 12:23'>2Sa 12:23</a> ; <a ref='Mark 10:14'>Mk 10:14</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 19:16'>19:16</a> <b>Teacher.</b> This is not necessarily a recognition of Christ’s deity. The young man simply meant that Christ was righteous and a teacher from God who apparently had eternal life and might know how he could get it. <a ref='Matthew 19:17'>19:17</a> <b>Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is</b> only <b>One who is good.</b> Jesus was not disclaiming His own deity, but rather teaching the young man that all but God are sinners. This young man’s most serious spiritual defect was his reluctance to confess his own utter spiritual bankruptcy. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 5:3'>5:3</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Luke 18:11'>Lk 18:11</a> . <b>if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.</b> This, of course, is law, not gospel. Before showing him the way to life, Jesus wanted to impress on the young man both the high standard required by God and the absolute futility of seeking salvation by his own merit. This should have elicited a response about the impossibility of keeping the law perfectly (like the disciples’ response in v. <a ref='Matthew 19:25'>25</a> ), but instead the young man confidently declared that he qualified for heaven under those terms. <a ref='Matthew 19:18–19'>19:18–19</a> These are 5 of the 6 commandments that make up the second table of the Ten Commandments—all dealing with human relationships (cf. <a ref='Exodus 20:12–16'>Ex 20:12–16</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:16–20'>Dt 5:16–20</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 22:40'>22:40</a> .</i> Christ omitted the tenth commandment, which deals with covetousness, and added <a ref='Leviticus 19:18'>Lv 19:18</a> , the summation of the second half of the Decalogue. Cf. <a ref='Romans 13:1–10'>Ro 13:1–10</a> . <a ref='Matthew 19:20'>19:20</a> <b>I have kept.</b> The self-righteous young man would not admit to his own sin. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 9:13'>9:13</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 19:21'>19:21</a> <b>go</b> and <b>sell your possessions and give to the poor.</b> Again, Jesus was not setting forth terms for salvation, but rather exposing the young man’s true heart. His refusal to obey here revealed two things: 1) he was not blameless as far as the law was concerned, because he was guilty of loving himself and his possessions more than his neighbors (cf. v. <a ref='Matthew 19:19'>19</a> ); and 2) he lacked true faith, which involves a willingness to surrender all at Christ’s bidding ( <a ref='Matthew 16:24'>16:24</a> ). Jesus was not teaching salvation by philanthropy; but He was demanding that this young man give Him first place. The young man failed the test (v. <a ref='Matthew 19:22'>22</a> ). <b>come, follow Me.</b> This was the answer to the young man’s question in v. <a ref='Matthew 19:16'>16</a> . It was a call to faith. It is likely that the young man never even heard or contemplated it, though, because his own love of his possessions was such a stumbling block that he had already rejected Jesus’ claim to lordship over his life. Thus he walked away in unbelief. <a ref='Matthew 19:24'>19:24</a> <b>camel … eye of a needle.</b> I.e., it is impossible. Jesus was underscoring the impossibility of anyone’s being saved by merit. Since wealth was deemed proof of God’s approval, and those who had it could give more alms, it was commonly thought that rich people were the most likely candidates for heaven ( <i>see note on <a ref='Mark 10:25'>Mk 10:25</a></i> ). Jesus destroyed that notion, and along with it, the notion that anyone can merit enough divine favor to gain entrance into heaven. <i>See note on v. <a ref='Matthew 19:25'>25</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 19:25'>19:25</a> <b>Then who can be saved?</b> This was the right question to ask; it showed that they understood Jesus’ message ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 19:17'>17</a></i> ). Salvation is possible only through divine grace (v. <a ref='Matthew 19:26'>26</a> ). <i>See notes on <a ref='Romans 3:9–20'>Ro 3:9–20</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:10–13'>Ga 3:10–13</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:4–9'>Php 3:4–9</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 19:27'>19:27</a> <b>we have left everything and followed You.</b> Peter points out that they had already done what Christ demanded of the rich young ruler (v. <a ref='Matthew 19:21'>21</a> ). They had embarked on the life of faith with Christ. Note that Jesus did not rebuke Peter for his expectation of reward (cf. <a ref='Revelation 22:12'>Rev 22:12</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 19:28'>19:28</a> <b>regeneration.</b> Here the term does not carry its normal theological meaning of personal regeneration (cf. <a ref='Titus 3:5'>Tit 3:5</a> ). Instead, Jesus was speaking of “the period of restoration of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient time” ( <a ref='Acts 3:21'>Ac 3:21</a> ). This is a reference to the earthly kingdom described in <a ref='Revelation 20:1–15'>Rev 20:1–15</a> , when believers will sit with Christ on His throne ( <a ref='Revelation 3:21'>Rev 3:21</a> ). <b>judging.</b> Governing.

Day laborers stood in the marketplace from dawn, hoping to be hired for the day’s work.

The man was acting graciously to those whom he overpaid. This was no slight against those whom he paid a full wage for a full day’s work. That was precisely what they agreed to in the beginning. But it was his privilege to extend the same generosity to all (v. <a ref='Matthew 20:15'>15</a> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 9:15'>Ro 9:15</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 20:16'>20:16</a> <b>last shall be first … first last.</b> In other words, everyone finishes in a dead heat. No matter how long each of the workers worked, they each received a full day’s wage. Similarly, the thief on the cross will enjoy the full blessings of heaven alongside those who have labored their whole lives for Christ. Such is the grace of God ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 19:30'>19:30</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 20:17'>20:17</a> <b>go up to Jerusalem.</b> Thus began His final journey to the cross. <a ref='Matthew 20:19'>20:19</a> <b>flog and crucify.</b> This was the third time Jesus told the disciples of His death ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 16:21'>16:21</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 17:22–23'>17:22–23</a> )—plus 3 of the disciples had overheard Jesus discussing His death with Moses and Elijah at the Transfiguration ( <a ref='Luke 9:31'>Lk 9:31</a> ). This time, however, He added more details. <a ref='Matthew 20:20'>20:20</a> <b>mother of the sons of Zebedee.</b> <a ref='Mark 10:35'>Mk 10:35</a> says James and John themselves raised the question of v. <a ref='Matthew 20:21'>21</a> .

They all would have petitioned Jesus for the exalted, favored positions, given the opportunity. <i>See note on v. <a ref='Matthew 20:21'>21</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 20:25–28'>20:25–28</a> In this rich text, the Lord was teaching the disciples that the style of greatness and leadership for believers is different. The Gentile leaders dominate in dictatorial fashion, using carnal power and authority. Believers are to do the opposite—they lead by being servants and giving themselves away for others, as Jesus did. <a ref='Matthew 20:28'>20:28</a> <b>to give His life a ransom for many.</b> The word translated “for” means “in the place of,” underscoring the substitutionary nature of Christ’s sacrifice. A “ransom” is a price paid to redeem a slave or a prisoner. Redemption does not involve a price paid to Satan. Rather, the ransom is offered to God—to satisfy His justice and wrath against sin. The price paid was Christ’s own life—as a blood atonement (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 17:11'>Lv 17:11</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:22'>Heb 9:22</a> ). This, then, is the meaning of the cross: Christ subjected Himself to the divine punishment against sin on our behalf (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 53:4–5'>Is 53:4–5</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a></i> ). Suffering the brunt of divine wrath in the place of sinners was the “cup” He spoke of having to drink (v. <a ref='Matthew 20:22'>22</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 20:29'>20:29</a> <b>leaving Jericho.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Matthew 20:30'>30</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 20:30'>20:30</a> <b>two blind men.</b> <a ref='Mark 10:46'>Mark 10:46</a> and <a ref='Luke 18:35'>Lk 18:35</a> mention only one blind man, and Luke says this encounter took place as Christ was approaching Jericho rather than when He was leaving (v. <a ref='Matthew 20:29'>29</a> ). The difficulties are fairly simple to reconcile: there were two blind men, but Bartimaeus ( <a ref='Mark 10:46'>Mk 10:46</a> ) was the spokesman of the two and was, therefore, the sole focus of both Luke’s and Mark’s accounts ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 8:28'>8:28</a></i> ). It is also a fact that there were two Jerichos—one the mound of the ancient city (the ruins of which may still be seen today), and the other, the inhabited city of Jericho, close by. Jesus may have been going out of old Jericho and entering new Jericho. Or it may also be that the events are telescoped for us, so that Christ first encountered the blind men on His way into the city, but the healing took place as He was departing. <b>Son of David.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 1:1'>1:1</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 21:1'>21:1</a> <b>Bethphage.</b> A small town near Bethany, on the southeast slope of the Mt. of Olives. It is mentioned nowhere else in Scripture except in connection with Christ’s triumphal entry ( <a ref='Mark 11:1'>Mk 11:1</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:29'>Lk 19:29</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 21:3'>21:3</a> <b>if anyone says anything to you.</b> Mark recorded that this was in fact exactly what happened ( <a ref='Mark 11:5–6'>Mk 11:5–6</a> ). Having just arrived in Bethphage (v. <a ref='Matthew 21:1'>1</a> ), Jesus would have had no opportunity to make arrangements for the use of these animals. Yet He knew precisely the location of the animals and the disposition of the owners. Such detailed foreknowledge reveals His divine omniscience. <a ref='Matthew 21:5'>21:5</a> a colt, the foal of a pack animal <b>.</b> An exact quotation from <a ref='Zechariah 9:9'>Zec 9:9</a> (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 62:11'>Is 62:11</a> ). The precise fulfillment of this messianic prophecy would not have escaped the Jewish multitudes, who responded with titles and accolades fit only for the Messiah ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 21:9'>9</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 21:7'>21:7</a> <b>the donkey and the colt.</b> Matthew is the only Gospel writer who mentions the mare donkey. But all mention the young age of the donkey ( <a ref='John 12:14'>Jn 12:14</a> ), or state that no man had ever sat on him ( <a ref='Mark 11:2'>Mk 11:2</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:30'>Lk 19:30</a> ). The mare was brought along, possibly to induce the colt to cooperate. <b>He sat.</b> I.e., on the clothes. Christ rode on the young colt ( <a ref='Mark 11:7'>Mk 11:7</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 21:8'>21:8</a> <b>spread their garments in the road.</b> Spreading one’s garments on the street was an ancient act of homage reserved for high royalty (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 9:13'>2Ki 9:13</a> ), suggesting that they recognized His claim to be King of the Jews. <a ref='Matthew 21:9'>21:9</a> <b>Hosanna.</b> This transliterates the Hebrew expression which is translated “Save!” in <a ref='Psalms 118:25'>Ps 118:25</a> . Blessed is He <b>.</b> This is an exact quotation from v. <a ref='Matthew 21:26'>26</a> of the same psalm. This, along with the messianic title “Son of David,” make it clear that the crowd was acknowledging Christ’s messianic claim ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 1:1'>1:1</a></i> ). The date of this entry was Monday, 10 Nisan, AD 30, exactly 483 years after the decree of Artaxerxes mentioned in <a ref='Daniel 9:24–26'>Da 9:24–26</a> ( <i>see note there</i> ). <a ref='Matthew 21:12'>21:12</a> <b>drove out.</b> This was the second time Jesus had cleansed the temple. <a ref='John 2:14–16'>Jn 2:14–16</a> describes a similar incident at the beginning of Christ’s public ministry. There are distinct differences in the two incidents. In the first cleansing, temple officials confronted Christ immediately afterward ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 21:23'>23</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='John 2:18'>Jn 2:18</a> ); none of the accounts of this second cleansing mention any such confrontation. Instead, the Synoptics all describe how Jesus addressed all present (v. <a ref='Matthew 21:13'>13</a> ) and even made the incident an occasion for public teaching ( <a ref='Mark 11:17'>Mk 11:17</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:46–47'>Lk 19:46–47</a> ). <b>those who were buying and selling.</b> He regarded both merchants and customers guilty of desecrating the temple. Items being bought and sold included “doves” and other animals for sacrifice (cf. <a ref='John 2:14'>Jn 2:14</a> ). <b>money changers.</b> Currency-exchange agents, present in droves, were needed because Roman coins and other forms of currency were deemed unacceptable for temple offerings. Evidently, both merchants and money changers were charging such excessive rates that the temple marketplace took on the atmosphere of a thieves’ den (v. <a ref='Matthew 21:13'>13</a> ). This kind of commerce took place in the court of the Gentiles, a large area covering several acres on the temple mount. <a ref='Matthew 21:13'>21:13</a> <b>It is written.</b> Jesus conflates two OT prophecies, <a ref='Isaiah 56:7'>Is 56:7</a> (“My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples”) and <a ref='Jeremiah 7:11'>Jer 7:11</a> (“Has this house, which is called by My name, become a robbers’ den in your sight?”). <a ref='Matthew 21:15'>21:15</a> <b>children.</b> Lit. “boys.” The crowd in Jerusalem for the Passover would have included a large number of 12-year-olds, who were there to celebrate their first Passover, just as Jesus Himself had done. <a ref='Matthew 21:16'>21:16</a> <b>Yes; have you never read.</b> Jesus’ reply to the “indignant” chief priests and scribes amounted to an inescapable assertion of His deity. In quoting from <a ref='Psalms 8:2'>Ps 8:2</a> , He was claiming the right to receive worship as God. <a ref='Matthew 21:19'>21:19</a> <b>at once.</b> This is a relative term; the tree may have died at once, but <a ref='Mark 11:14'>Mk 11:14</a> , <a ref='Mark 11:20'>20</a> ( <i>see notes there</i> ) suggested that the withering was not visible until the following day. Jesus’ cursing of the tree was a purposeful divine object lesson, not an impetuous act of frustration. The fig tree is often employed in Scripture as a symbol of Israel ( <a ref='Hosea 9:10'>Hos 9:10</a> ; <a ref='Joel 1:7'>Joel 1:7</a> )—and the barren fig tree often symbolizes divine judgment on Israel because of her spiritual fruitlessness ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 3:8'>3:8</a></i> ) despite an abundance of spiritual advantages ( <a ref='Jeremiah 8:13'>Jer 8:13</a> ; <a ref='Joel 1:12'>Joel 1:12</a> ). Jesus’ act therefore illustrates God’s judgment against earthly Israel for shameful fruitlessness, exemplified in the rejection of their Messiah. One of Christ’s parables taught a similar lesson ( <a ref='Luke 13:6–9'>Lk 13:6–9</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 21:21'>21:21</a> <b>if you have faith and do not doubt.</b> This presupposes that the thing requested is actually God’s will ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 17:20'>17:20</a></i> )—for only God-given faith is so doubt-free (cf. <a ref='Mark 9:24'>Mk 9:24</a> ). <b>it will happen.</b> A miracle on such a cosmic scale was precisely what the scribes and Pharisees wanted Christ to do, but He always declined ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 12:38'>12:38</a></i> ). Here, He was speaking figuratively about the immeasurable power of God, unleashed in the lives of those with true faith. <a ref='Matthew 21:23'>21:23</a> <b>these things.</b> I.e., both His public teaching and miracles. They may have also had in mind His act of cleansing the temple on the day before ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 21:12'>12</a></i> ). <b>who gave You this authority?</b> They were forced to acknowledge that He had some source of indisputable authority. His miracles were too obvious and too numerous to be fraudulent. Even His teaching was with such force and clarity that it was obvious to all that there was authority in His words ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 7:29'>7:29</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 21:25'>21:25</a> <b>The baptism of John was from what</b> source <b>… ?</b> Jesus caught the Jewish leaders in their own trap. They had no doubt hoped that He would answer by asserting that His authority came directly from God (as He had many times before—cf. <a ref='John 5:19–23'>Jn 5:19–23</a> ; <a ref='John 10:18'>10:18</a> ). They then accused Him of blasphemy and used the charge as an excuse to kill Him—as they had also attempted to do before ( <a ref='John 5:18'>Jn 5:18</a> ; <a ref='John 10:31–33'>10:31–33</a> ). Here, however, He asked a question that placed them in an impossible dilemma, because John was widely revered by the people. They could not affirm John’s ministry without condemning themselves. And if they denied John’s legitimacy, they feared the response of the people (v. <a ref='Matthew 21:26'>26</a> ). In effect, Jesus exposed their own lack of any authority to examine Him. <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 20:5'>Lk 20:5</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 21:31'>21:31</a> <b>Which of the two did the will of his father?</b> Jesus forced them to testify against themselves. The point of the parable was that doing is more important than saying (cf. <a ref='Matthew 7:21–27'>7:21–27</a> ; <a ref='James 1:22'>Jas 1:22</a> ). They had to acknowledge this, yet in doing so they condemned themselves. The idea that repentant tax collectors and harlots would enter the kingdom before outwardly religious hypocrites was a recurring theme in His ministry ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 5:20'>5:20</a></i> ), and this infuriated the Jewish leaders. <a ref='Matthew 21:32'>21:32</a> <b>the way of righteousness.</b> I.e., the repentance and faith that results in the imputation of God’s righteousness ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 3:21'>Ro 3:21</a></i> ). <b>tax collectors and prostitutes.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 5:46'>5:46</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 9:9'>9:9</a> ; <a ref='Mark 2:15'>Mk 2:15</a> .</i> The pariahs of Jewish society, most publicly despised by the chief priests and elders, had found salvation, while the self-righteous leaders had not. Cf. <a ref='Romans 10:3'>Ro 10:3</a> . <a ref='Matthew 21:33'>21:33</a> a vineyard. … wine press <b>.</b> See <a ref='Isaiah 5:2'>Is 5:2</a> . Jesus was clearly alluding to this OT passage, which would have been familiar to the Jewish leaders. The “vineyard” is a common symbol for the Jewish nation in Scripture. Here the landowner, representing God, developed the vineyard with great care, then leased it to “vine-growers,” representing the Jewish leaders. <a ref='Matthew 21:34'>21:34</a> <b>his slaves.</b> I.e., the OT prophets. <a ref='Matthew 21:35'>21:35</a> <b>beat one … killed another … stoned a third.</b> Matthew often blends and simplifies details ( <i>see notes on v. <a ref='Matthew 21:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 8:28'>8:28</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 20:30'>20:30</a></i> ). From Mark’s account we learn that in Jesus’ telling of this story, 3 different slaves came individually. The tenants “beat” the first one, “wounded” the second, and “killed” the third ( <a ref='Mark 12:2–5'>Mk 12:2–5</a> ). This corresponds to the Jewish rulers’ treatment of many of the OT prophets ( <a ref='1 Kings 22:24'>1Ki 22:24</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 24:20–21'>2Chr 24:20–21</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:15–16'>36:15–16</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 9:26'>Ne 9:26</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 2:30'>Jer 2:30</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 21:37'>21:37</a> <b>my son.</b> This person represents the Lord Jesus Christ, whom they killed (vv. <a ref='Matthew 21:38–39'>38–39</a> ) and thereby incurred divine judgment (v. <a ref='Matthew 21:41'>41</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 21:41'>21:41</a> <b>rent out the vineyard to other vine-growers.</b> Again the Jewish leaders pronounced their own judgment ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 21:31'>31</a></i> ). Their verdict against the evil vine-growers was also Christ’s judgment against them (v. <a ref='Matthew 21:43'>43</a> ). The kingdom and all the spiritual advantages given to Israel would now be given to “other vine-growers,” symbolizing the church (v. <a ref='Matthew 21:43'>43</a> ), which consists primarily of Gentiles (cf. <a ref='Romans 11:11'>Ro 11:11</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 21:42'>21:42</a> the stone … rejected <b>.</b> This refers to His crucifixion; and the restoration of “the chief corner stone” anticipates His resurrection. the chief corner stone <b>.</b> To the superficial eye, this quotation from <a ref='Psalms 118:22–23'>Ps 118:22–23</a> is irrelevant to the parable that precedes it. But it is taken from a messianic psalm. Jesus cited it to suggest that the Son who was killed and thrown out of the vineyard was also “the chief corner stone” in God’s redemptive plan. <a ref='Matthew 21:43'>21:43</a> <b>a nation, producing the fruit of it.</b> The church. <i>See note on v. <a ref='Matthew 21:41'>41</a> .</i> Peter spoke of the church as “a holy nation” ( <a ref='1 Peter 2:9'>1Pe 2:9</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 21:44'>21:44</a> <b>this stone.</b> Christ is “a stone to strike and a rock to stumble over” to unbelievers ( <a ref='Isaiah 8:14'>Is 8:14</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:8'>1Pe 2:8</a> ). And the prophet Daniel pictured Him as a great stone “cut out of the mountain without hands,” which falls on the kingdoms of the world and crushes them ( <a ref='Daniel 2:44–45'>Da 2:44–45</a> ). Whether a ceramic vessel “falls on” a rock, or the rock “falls” on the vessel, the result is the same. The saying suggests that both enmity and apathy are wrong responses to Christ, and those guilty of either are in danger of judgment. <a ref='Matthew 21:45'>21:45</a> <b>they understood that He *was speaking about them.</b> By evoking so much familiar messianic imagery (vv. <a ref='Matthew 21:42–44'>42–44</a> ), Christ made His meaning inescapable to the chief priests and Pharisees. <a ref='Matthew 22:2'>22:2</a> <b>a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.</b> Jesus told a similar, but different, parable in <a ref='Luke 14:16–23'>Lk 14:16–23</a> . Here, the banquet was a wedding feast for the king’s own son, making the apathy (v. <a ref='Matthew 22:5'>5</a> ) and rejection (v. <a ref='Matthew 22:6'>6</a> ) of those invited much more of a personal slight against the king. Also, here they actually mistreated and killed the king’s messengers—an unthinkable affront to the king’s goodness. <a ref='Matthew 22:4'>22:4</a> <b>Again he sent out other slaves.</b> This illustrates God’s patience and forbearance with those who deliberately spurn Him. He continues to extend the invitation even after His goodness has been ignored or rebuffed. <a ref='Matthew 22:7'>22:7</a> <b>the king was enraged.</b> His vast patience finally exhausted, He judges them. <b>set their city on fire.</b> The judgment Jesus described anticipated the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70. Even the massive stone temple was destroyed by fire and reduced to rubble in that conflagration. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 23:36'>23:36</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:2'>24:2</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:43'>Lk 19:43</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 22:9'>22:9</a> <b>as many as you find … call to the wedding feast.</b> This illustrates the free offer of the gospel, which is extended to all indiscriminately (cf. <a ref='Revelation 22:17'>Rev 22:17</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 22:11'>22:11</a> <b>wedding clothes.</b> All without exception were invited to the banquet, so this man is not to be viewed as a common party-crasher. In fact, all the guests were rounded up hastily from “the streets” and therefore none could be expected to come with proper attire. That means the wedding garments were supplied by the king himself. So this man’s lack of a proper garment indicates he had purposely rejected the king’s own gracious provision. His affront to the king was actually a greater insult than those who refused to come at all, because he committed his impertinence in the very presence of the king. The imagery seems to represent those who identify with the kingdom externally, profess to be Christians, belong to the church in a visible sense—yet spurn the garment of righteousness Christ offers (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 61:10'>Is 61:10</a> ) by seeking to establish a righteousness of their own (cf. <a ref='Romans 10:3'>Ro 10:3</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:8–9'>Php 3:8–9</a> ). Ashamed to admit their own spiritual poverty ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 5:3'>5:3</a></i> ), they refuse the better garment the King graciously offers—and thus they are guilty of a horrible sin against His goodness. <a ref='Matthew 22:12'>22:12</a> <b>the man was speechless.</b> I.e., he had no excuse. <a ref='Matthew 22:13'>22:13</a> <b>outer darkness.</b> This would describe the darkness farthest from the light, i.e., outer darkness. <b>weeping and gnashing of teeth.</b> This speaks of inconsolable grief and unremitting torment. Jesus commonly used the phrases in this verse to describe hell (cf. <a ref='Matthew 13:42'>13:42</a> , <a ref='Matthew 13:50'>50</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:51'>24:51</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 22:14'>22:14</a> <b>many are called, but few</b> are <b>chosen.</b> The call spoken of here is sometimes referred to as the “general call” (or the “external” call)—a summons to repentance and faith that is inherent in the gospel message. This call extends to all who hear the gospel. “Many” hear it; “few” respond (see the many-few comparison in <a ref='Matthew 7:13–14'>7:13–14</a> ). Those who respond are the “chosen,” the elect. In the Pauline writings, the word “call” usually refers to God’s irresistible calling extended to the elect alone ( <a ref='Romans 8:30'>Ro 8:30</a> )—known as the “effectual call” (or the “internal” call). The effectual call is the supernatural drawing of God which Jesus speaks of in <a ref='John 6:44'>Jn 6:44</a> . Here a general call is in view, and this call extends to all who hear the gospel—this call is the great “whosoever will” of the gospel (cf. <a ref='Revelation 22:17'>Rev 22:17</a> ). Here, then, is the proper balance between human responsibility and divine sovereignty: the “called” who reject the invitation do so willingly, and therefore their exclusion from the kingdom is perfectly just. The “chosen” enter the kingdom only because of the grace of God in choosing and drawing them. <a ref='Matthew 22:16'>22:16</a> <b>Herodians.</b> A party of the Jews who supported the Roman-backed Herodian dynasty. The Herodians were not a religious party, like the Pharisees, but a political party, probably consisting largely of Sadducees (including the rulers of the temple). By contrast, the Pharisees hated Roman rule and the Herodian influence. The fact that these groups would conspire together to entrap Jesus reveals how seriously both groups viewed Him as a threat. Herod himself wanted Jesus dead ( <a ref='Luke 13:31'>Lk 13:31</a> ), and the Pharisees were already plotting to kill Him as well ( <a ref='John 11:53'>Jn 11:53</a> ). So they joined efforts to seek their common goal. <a ref='Matthew 22:17'>22:17</a> <b>Is it lawful to give a tax to Caesar, or not?</b> At issue was an annual fee of one denarius ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 22:19'>19</a></i> ) per person. Such taxes were part of the heavy taxation Rome assessed. Since these funds were used to finance the occupying armies, all Roman taxes were hated by the people. But the poll tax was the most hated of all because it suggested that Rome owned even the people, while they viewed themselves and their nation as possessions of God. It was therefore significant that they questioned Christ about the poll tax in particular. If He answered no to their question, the Herodians would charge Him with treason against Rome. If He said yes, the Pharisees would accuse Him of disloyalty to the Jewish nation, and He would lose the support of the crowds. <a ref='Matthew 22:19'>22:19</a> <b>denarius.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Mark 12:16'>Mk 12:16</a> .</i> A silver coin, the value of a day’s wage for a Roman soldier. The coins were minted under the emperor’s authority since only he could issue gold or silver coins. The “denarius” of Jesus’ day was minted by Tiberius. One side bore an image of his face; the other featured an engraving of him sitting on his throne in priestly robes. The Jews considered such images idolatry, forbidden by the second commandment ( <a ref='Exodus 20:4'>Ex 20:4</a> ), which made this tax and these coins doubly offensive. <a ref='Matthew 22:21'>22:21</a> <b>Caesar’s … God’s.</b> Caesar’s image is stamped on the coin; God’s image is stamped on the person ( <a ref='Genesis 1:26–27'>Ge 1:26–27</a> ). The Christian must “render” obedience to Caesar in Caesar’s realm ( <a ref='Romans 13:1–7'>Ro 13:1–7</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:13–17'>1Pe 2:13–17</a> ), but “the things that are God’s” are things that do not belong to Caesar and should be given only to God. Christ thus acknowledged Caesar’s right to assess and collect taxes, and He made it the duty of Christians to pay them. But He did not suggest (as some suppose) that Caesar had sole or ultimate authority in the social or political realms. Ultimately, all things are God’s ( <a ref='Romans 11:36'>Ro 11:36</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:18'>2Co 5:18</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 4:11'>Rev 4:11</a> )—including the realm in which Caesar or any other earthly ruler exercises authority. <a ref='Matthew 22:23'>22:23</a> <b>no resurrection.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 3:7'>3:7</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 22:24'>22:24</a> his brother … shall marry his wife <b>.</b> This refers to the law of levirate marriage, found in <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:5–10'>Dt 25:5–10</a> ( <i>see note there</i> ). This was a provision to ensure that family lines were kept intact and widows were cared for. <a ref='Matthew 22:30'>22:30</a> <b>like angels in heaven.</b> The Sadducees did not believe in angels ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 3:7'>3:7</a></i> )—so here Jesus was exposing another of their false beliefs. Angels are deathless creatures who do not propagate and therefore have no need for marriage. “In the resurrection,” the saints will have those same characteristics. <a ref='Matthew 22:32'>22:32</a> <b>not the God of the dead.</b> Jesus’ argument (taken from the Pentateuch, because the Sadducees recognized only Moses’ authority— <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 3:7'>3:7</a></i> ) was based on the emphatic present tense “I am” of <a ref='Exodus 3:6'>Ex 3:6</a> . This subtle but effective argument utterly silenced the Sadducees (v. <a ref='Matthew 22:34'>34</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Mark 12:26'>Mk 12:26</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 22:35'>22:35</a> <b>a scholar of the Law.</b> A scribe whose specialty was interpreting the law. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 2:4'>2:4</a> ; <a ref='Luke 10:25'>Lk 10:25</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 22:36'>22:36</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Mark 12:28'>Mk 12:28</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 22:37'>22:37</a> heart … soul … mind <b>.</b> <a ref='Mark 12:30'>Mk 12:30</a> adds “strength.” The quote is from <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:5'>Dt 6:5</a> , part of the <i>shema</i> , (Hebrew for “hear”— <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:4'>Dt 6:4</a> ). That verse says “heart … soul … might.” Some LXX manuscripts added “mind.” The use of the various terms is not meant to delineate distinct human faculties, but to underscore the completeness of the kind of love that is called for. <a ref='Matthew 22:39'>22:39</a> love your neighbor as yourself <b>.</b> This is a quotation from <a ref='Leviticus 19:18'>Lv 19:18</a> . Contrary to some contemporary interpretations, it is not a mandate for self-love. Rather, it contains in different words the very same idea as the Golden Rule ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 7:12'>7:12</a></i> ). It prompts believers to measure their love for others by what they wish for themselves. <a ref='Matthew 22:40'>22:40</a> <b>the whole Law and the Prophets.</b> I.e., the whole OT. Thus Jesus subsumes man’s whole moral duty under two categories: love for God, and love for one’s neighbors. These same two categories differentiate the first 4 commandments of the Decalogue from the final 6. <a ref='Matthew 22:42'>22:42</a> <b>What do you think…?</b> A phrase often used by Christ to introduce a question designed to test someone (v. <a ref='Matthew 22:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 17:25'>17:25</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 18:12'>18:12</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 21:28'>21:28</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 26:66'>26:66</a> ). Here, the Pharisees, Herodians, Sadducees, and scribes had all put Him to the test. He also had a test for them. The son <b>of David.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 1:1'>1:1</a> .</i> “Son of David” was the most common messianic title in the usage of Jesus’ day. Their answer reflected their conviction that the Messiah would be no more than a man, and Jesus’ reply was another assertion of His deity. <i>See note on v. <a ref='Matthew 22:45'>45</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 22:43'>22:43</a> <b>in the Spirit.</b> I.e., under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit (cf. <a ref='Mark 12:36'>Mk 12:36</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 22:44'>22:44</a> Quoted from <a ref='Psalms 110:1'>Ps 110:1</a> . <a ref='Matthew 22:45'>22:45</a> <b>David then calls Him “Lord.”</b> David would not have addressed a merely human descendant as “Lord.” Here Jesus was not disputing whether “Son of David” was an appropriate title for the Messiah; after all, the title is based on what is revealed about the Messiah in the OT ( <a ref='Isaiah 11:1'>Is 11:1</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:5'>Jer 23:5</a> ) and it is used as a messianic title in <a ref='Matthew 1:1'>1:1</a> ( <i>see note there</i> ). But Jesus was pointing out that the title “son of David” did not begin to sum up all that is true about the Messiah who is also “Son of God” ( <a ref='Luke 22:70'>Lk 22:70</a> ). The inescapable implication is that Jesus was declaring His deity. <a ref='Matthew 23:2'>23:2</a> <b>chair of Moses.</b> The expression is equivalent to a university’s “chair of philosophy.” To “sit in the chair of Moses” was to have the highest authority to instruct people in the law. The expression here may be translated, “[they] have seated themselves in Moses’ seat”—stressing the fact that this was an imaginary authority they claimed for themselves. There was a legitimate sense in which the priests and Levites had authority to decide matters of the law ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:9'>Dt 17:9</a> ), but the scribes and Pharisees had gone beyond any legitimate authority and were adding human tradition to the Word of God ( <a ref='Matthew 15:3–9'>15:3–9</a> ). For that Jesus condemned them (vv. <a ref='Matthew 23:8–36'>8–36</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 23:3'>23:3</a> <b>keep … do not do.</b> I.e., insofar as it accords with the Word of God. The Pharisees were prone to bind “heavy burdens” (v. <a ref='Matthew 23:4'>4</a> ) of extrabiblical traditions and put them on others’ shoulders. Jesus explicitly condemned that sort of legalism. <a ref='Matthew 23:5'>23:5</a> <b>phylacteries.</b> Leather boxes containing a parchment on which is written in 4 columns ( <a ref='Exodus 13:1–10'>Ex 13:1–10</a> , <a ref='Exodus 13:11–16'>11–16</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:4–9'>Dt 6:4–9</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:13–21'>11:13–21</a> ). These are worn by men during prayer—one on the middle of the forehead and one on the left arm just above the elbow. The use of phylacteries was based on an overly literal interpretation of passages like <a ref='Exodus 13:9–10'>Ex 13:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:8'>Dt 6:8</a> . Evidently, the Pharisees would broaden the leather straps by which the phylacteries were bound to their arms and foreheads, in order to make the phylacteries more prominent. <b>the tassels</b> of their garments <b>.</b> Jesus Himself wore them ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 9:20'>9:20</a></i> ), so it was not the tassels themselves that He condemned, only the mentality that would lengthen the tassels to make it appear that one was especially spiritual. <a ref='Matthew 23:8–10'>23:8–10</a> <b>Rabbi … father … instructors.</b> Here Jesus condemns pride and pretense, not titles per se. Paul repeatedly speaks of “leaders” in the church, and even refers to himself as the Corinthians’ “father” ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 4:15'>1Co 4:15</a> ). Obviously, this does not forbid the showing of respect, either (cf. <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:11–12'>1Th 5:11–12</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 5:1'>1Ti 5:1</a> ). Christ is merely forbidding the use of such names as spiritual titles, or in an ostentatious sense that accords undue spiritual authority to a human being, as if he were the source of truth rather than God. <a ref='Matthew 23:13'>23:13</a> <b>nor do you allow.</b> The Pharisees, having shunned God’s righteousness, were seeking to establish a righteousness of their own ( <a ref='Romans 10:3'>Ro 10:3</a> )—and teaching others to do so as well. Their legalism and self-righteousness effectively obscured the narrow gate by which the kingdom must be entered ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 7:13–14'>7:13–14</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 23:14'>23:14</a> This verse does not appear in the earliest available manuscripts of Matthew, but does appear in Mark. <i>See notes on <a ref='Mark 12:40'>Mk 12:40</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 23:15'>23:15</a> <b>proselyte.</b> A Gentile convert to Judaism. <i>See <a ref='Acts 6:5'>Ac 6:5</a> .</i> <b>a son of hell.</b> I.e., someone whose eternal destination is hell. <a ref='Matthew 23:16'>23:16</a> that <b>is nothing.</b> This was an arbitrary distinction the Pharisees had made, which gave them a sanctimonious justification for lying with impunity. If someone swore “by the sanctuary” (or the altar, v. <a ref='Matthew 23:18'>18</a> ; or heaven, v. <a ref='Matthew 23:22'>22</a> ), his oath was not considered binding, but if he swore “by the gold of the temple,” he could not break his word without being subject to the penalties of Jewish law. Our Lord makes it clear that swearing by those things is tantamount to swearing by God Himself. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 5:34'>5:34</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 23:23'>23:23</a> <b>tithe mint and dill and cumin.</b> Garden herbs, not really the kind of farm produce that the tithe was designed to cover ( <a ref='Leviticus 27:30'>Lv 27:30</a> ). But the Pharisees fastidiously weighed out a tenth of every herb, perhaps even counting individual dill seeds. Jesus’ point, however, was not to condemn their observance of the law’s fine points. The problem was that they “neglected the weightier provisions” of justice and mercy and faith—the moral principles underlying all the laws. They were satisfied with their focus on the incidentals and externals but willfully resisted the spiritual meaning of the law. He told them they should have concentrated on those larger issues “without neglecting the others.” <a ref='Matthew 23:24'>23:24</a> <b>strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!</b> Some Pharisees would strain their beverages through a fine cloth to make sure they did not inadvertently swallow a gnat—the smallest of unclean animals ( <a ref='Leviticus 11:23'>Lv 11:23</a> ). The camel was the largest of all the unclean animals ( <a ref='Leviticus 11:4'>Lv 11:4</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 23:25'>23:25</a> <b>you clean the outside.</b> The Pharisees’ focus on external issues lay at the heart of their error. Who would want to drink from a cup that had been washed on the outside but was still filthy inside? Yet the Pharisees lived their lives as if external appearance were more important than internal reality. That was the very essence of their hypocrisy, and Jesus rebuked them for it repeatedly ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 5:20'>5:20</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 16:12'>16:12</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 23:27'>23:27</a> <b>whitewashed tombs.</b> Tombs were regularly whitewashed to make them stand out. Accidentally touching or stepping on a grave caused ceremonial uncleanness ( <a ref='Numbers 19:16'>Nu 19:16</a> ). A freshly whitewashed tomb would be brilliantly white and clean-looking—and sometimes spectacularly ornate. But the inside was full of defilement and decay. Contrast Jesus’ words here and in <a ref='Luke 11:44'>Lk 11:44</a> . <a ref='Matthew 23:30'>23:30</a> <b>we would not have been partners.</b> A ridiculous claim to self-righteousness when they were already plotting the murder of the Messiah (cf. <a ref='John 11:47–53'>Jn 11:47–53</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 23:34'>23:34</a> <b>prophets and wise men and scribes.</b> I.e., the disciples, as well as the prophets, evangelists, and pastors who followed them (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 4:11'>Eph 4:11</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 23:35'>23:35</a> <b>Abel … Zechariah.</b> The first and last OT martyrs, respectively. <b>son of Berechiah.</b> ( <a ref='Zechariah 1:1'>Zec 1:1</a> ). The OT does not record how he died. However, the death of another Zechariah, son of Jehoiada, is recorded in <a ref='2 Chronicles 24:20–21'>2Chr 24:20–21</a> . He was stoned in the court of the temple, exactly as Jesus describes here. All the best manuscripts of Matthew contain the phrase “Zechariah, son of Berechiah” (though it does not appear in <a ref='Luke 11:51'>Lk 11:51</a> ). Some have suggested that the Zechariah in <a ref='2Ch 24'>2Chr 24</a> was actually a grandson of Jehoiada, and that his father’s name was also Berechiah. But there is no difficulty if we simply take Jesus’ words at face value and accept His infallible testimony that Zechariah the prophet was martyred between the temple and the altar, in a way very similar to how the earlier Zechariah was killed. <a ref='Matthew 23:36'>23:36</a> <b>this generation.</b> Historically, this was the generation that experienced the utter destruction of Jerusalem and the burning of the temple in AD 70. Jesus’ lament over Jerusalem and His removal of the blessing of God from the temple (vv. <a ref='Matthew 23:37–38'>37–38</a> ) strongly suggest that the sacking of Jerusalem in AD 70 was the judgment He was speaking about. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 22:7'>22:7</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:2'>24:2</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:43'>Lk 19:43</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 23:37'>23:37</a> <b>I wanted … you did not want</b> it <b>.</b> God is utterly sovereign and therefore fully capable of bringing to pass whatever He desires (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 46:10'>Is 46:10</a> )—including the salvation of whomever He chooses ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:4–5'>Eph 1:4–5</a> ). Yet, He sometimes expresses a wish for that which He does not sovereignly bring to pass (cf. <a ref='Genesis 6:6'>Ge 6:6</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:29'>Dt 5:29</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 81:13'>Ps 81:13</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 48:18'>Is 48:18</a> ). Such expressions in no way suggest a limitation on the sovereignty of God or imply any actual change in Him ( <a ref='Numbers 23:19'>Nu 23:19</a> ). But these statements do reveal essential aspects of the divine character: He is full of compassion, sincerely good to all, desirous of good, not evil—and therefore not delighting in the destruction of the wicked ( <a ref='Ezekiel 18:32'>Eze 18:32</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 33:11'>33:11</a> ). While affirming God’s sovereignty, one must understand His pleas for the repentance of the reprobate as well-meant appeals—and His goodness toward the wicked as a genuine mercy designed to provoke them to repentance ( <a ref='Romans 2:4'>Ro 2:4</a> ). The emotion displayed by Christ here (and in all similar passages, such as <a ref='Luke 19:41'>Lk 19:41</a> ) is obviously a deep, sincere passion. All Christ’s feelings must be in perfect harmony with the divine will (cf. <a ref='John 8:29'>Jn 8:29</a> )—and therefore these lamentations should not be thought of as mere exhibitions of His humanity. <a ref='Matthew 23:38'>23:38</a> <b>your house is being left to you desolate!</b> A few days earlier, Christ had referred to the temple as His Father’s “house” ( <a ref='Matthew 21:13'>21:13</a> ). But the blessing and glory of God were being removed from Israel (see <a ref='1 Samuel 4:21'>1Sa 4:21</a> ). When Christ came “out from the temple” ( <a ref='Matthew 24:1'>24:1</a> ), the glory of God went with Him. <a ref='Ezekiel 11:23'>Ezekiel 11:23</a> described Ezekiel’s vision of the departure of the Shekinah glory in his day. The glory left the temple and stood on the Mt. of Olives ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 24:3'>24:3</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:29'>Lk 19:29</a></i> ), exactly the same route Christ followed here (cf. <a ref='Matthew 24:3'>24:3</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 23:39'>23:39</a> <b>you will not see Me.</b> Christ’s public teaching ministry was over. He withdrew from national Israel until the time yet future when they will recognize Him as Messiah ( <a ref='Romans 11:23–26'>Ro 11:23–26</a> ). Then Christ quoted from <a ref='Psalms 118:26'>Ps 118:26</a> . <a ref='Matthew 24:1–25:46'>24:1—25:46</a> This is the last of the 5 discourses Matthew features (see Introduction: Historical and Theological Themes ). It is known as the Olivet Discourse, and it contains some of the most important prophetic material in all of Scripture. <a ref='Matthew 24:1'>24:1</a> <b>the temple buildings.</b> This temple was begun by Herod the Great in 20 BC ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 2:1'>2:1</a></i> ) and was still under construction when the Romans destroyed it in AD 70 ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 24:2'>2</a></i> ). At the time of Jesus’ ministry, the temple was one of the most impressive structures in the world, made of massive blocks of stone bedecked with gold ornamentation. Some of the stones in the temple complex measured 40x12x12 ft. and were expertly quarried to fit perfectly against one another. The temple buildings were made of gleaming white marble, and the whole eastern wall of the large main structure was covered with gold plates that reflected the morning sun, making a spectacle that was visible for miles. The entire temple mount had been enlarged by Herod’s engineers, by means of large retaining walls and vaulted chambers on the south side and southeast corner. By this means the large courtyard area atop the temple mount was effectively doubled. The whole temple complex was magnificent by any standard. The disciples’ conversation here may have been prompted by Jesus’ words in <a ref='Matthew 23:38'>23:38</a> . They were undoubtedly wondering how a site so spectacular could be left “desolate.” <a ref='Matthew 24:2'>24:2</a> <b>not one stone here … left upon another.</b> These words were literally fulfilled in AD 70. Titus, the Roman general, built large wooden scaffolds around the walls of the temple buildings, piled them high with wood and other flammable items, and set them ablaze. The heat from the fires was so intense that the stones crumbled. The rubble was then sifted to retrieve the melted gold, and the remaining ruins were “thrown down” into the Kidron Valley. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 22:7'>22:7</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:43'>Lk 19:43</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 24:3'>24:3</a> <b>Mount of Olives.</b> The hill directly opposite the temple, across the Kidron Valley to the east ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 19:29'>Lk 19:29</a></i> ). This spot affords the best panoramic view of Jerusalem. At the base of this mountain is Gethsemane ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 26:36'>26:36</a></i> ). <b>what</b> will be <b>the sign of Your coming…?</b> <a ref='Luke 19:11'>Luke 19:11</a> records that the disciples still “thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.” The destruction of the temple (v. <a ref='Matthew 24:2'>2</a> ) did not fit the eschatological scheme they envisioned, so they asked for clarification. Jesus addressed their questions in reverse order, describing the prophetic sign of His coming (actually a series of signs) in vv. <a ref='Matthew 24:4–35'>4–35</a> and then addressing their question about the timing of these events beginning in v. <a ref='Matthew 24:36'>36</a> . When they asked about His coming (Greek, <i>parousia;</i> lit. “presence”), they did not envision a second coming in the far-off future. They were speaking of His coming in triumph as Messiah, an event which they no doubt anticipated would occur presently. Even if they were conscious of His approaching death, which He had plainly prophesied to them on repeated occasions ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 20:19'>20:19</a></i> ), they could not have anticipated His ascension to heaven and the long intervening church age. However, when Jesus used the term <i>parousia</i> in His discourse, He used it in the technical sense as a reference to His second coming. <a ref='Matthew 24:6'>24:6</a> <b>not yet the end.</b> False prophets, as well as wars and rumors of wars, characterize the whole of the present age, but will escalate toward the end (cf. <a ref='2 Timothy 3:13'>2Ti 3:13</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 24:8'>24:8</a> <b>birth pains.</b> Famines, earthquakes, and conflicts have always characterized life in a fallen world; but by calling these things “the beginning” of labor pains, He indicated that things will get notably and remarkably worse at the end of the era as these unique tribulations signal the soon arrival of Messiah to judge sinful humanity and set up His millennial kingdom. Cf. <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:3'>1Th 5:3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 6:1–17'>Rev 6:1–17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 8:1–9:21'>8:1—9:21</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:1–21'>16:1–21</a> ; <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 24:14'>14</a></i> . <a ref='Matthew 24:9'>24:9</a> <b>deliver you.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 10:17'>10:17</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 24:10'>24:10</a> <b>many will fall away.</b> Lit. “cause to stumble”—suggesting professing believers who fall away—and even turn against “one another” in shocking acts of spiritual treachery. Those who fall away in such a manner give evidence that they never were true believers at all ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 24:13'>13</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 24:13'>24:13</a> <b>endures to the end … be saved.</b> Cf. <a ref='Matthew 10:22'>10:22</a> . The ones who persevere are the same ones who are saved—not the ones whose love grows cold (v. <a ref='Matthew 24:12'>12</a> ). This does not suggest that our perseverance secures our salvation. Scripture everywhere teaches precisely the opposite: God, as part of His saving work, secures our perseverance. True believers “are protected by the power of God through faith for … salvation” ( <a ref='1 Peter 1:5'>1Pe 1:5</a> ). The guarantee of our perseverance is built into the New Covenant promise. God says: “I will put the fear of Me in their hearts so that they will not turn away from Me” ( <a ref='Jeremiah 32:40'>Jer 32:40</a> ). Those who do fall away from Christ give conclusive proof that they were never truly believers to begin with ( <a ref='1 John 2:19'>1Jn 2:19</a> ). To say that God secures our perseverance is not to say that we are passive in the process, however. He keeps us “through faith” ( <a ref='1 Peter 1:5'>1Pe 1:5</a> )—our faith. Scripture sometimes calls us to hold fast to our faith ( <a ref='Hebrews 10:23'>Heb 10:23</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 3:11'>Rev 3:11</a> ) or warns us against falling away ( <a ref='Hebrews 10:26–29'>Heb 10:26–29</a> ). Such admonitions do not negate the many promises that true believers will persevere ( <a ref='John 10:28–29'>Jn 10:28–29</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:38–39'>Ro 8:38–39</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:8–9'>1Co 1:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 1:6'>Php 1:6</a> ). Rather, the warnings and pleas are among the means God uses to secure our perseverance in the faith. Notice that the warnings and the promises often appear side by side. For example, when Jude urges believers, “keep yourselves in the love of God” ( <a ref='Jude 1:21'>Jd 21</a> ), he immediately points them to God, “who is able to keep you from stumbling” ( <a ref='Jude 1:24'>Jd 24</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 24:14'>24:14</a> <b>proclaimed in the whole world.</b> Despite all the tribulations that would come—the deception of false teachers, the wars, persecutions, natural disasters, defections from Christ, and all the obstacles to the spread of the gospel—the message ultimately penetrates every part of the globe. God is never without a witness, and He will proclaim the gospel from heaven itself if necessary (cf. <a ref='Revelation 14:6'>Rev 14:6</a> ). <b>then the end will come.</b> “The end” refers to the final, excruciating birth pangs ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 24:8'>8</a></i> ). This is how Christ characterizes the time of Great Tribulation described in the verses that follow. <a ref='Matthew 24:15'>24:15</a> abomination of desolation <b>.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>Da 9:27</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 11:31'>11:31</a> .</i> This phrase originally referred to the desecration of the temple by Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria in the second century BC. Antiochus invaded Jerusalem in 168 BC, made the altar into a shrine to Zeus, and even sacrificed pigs on it. However, Jesus clearly was looking toward a yet-future “abomination of desolation.” Some suggest that this prophecy was fulfilled in AD 70 when Titus invaded Jerusalem and destroyed the temple ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 24:2'>2</a></i> ). However, the Apostle Paul saw a still-future fulfillment ( <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:3–4'>2Th 2:3–4</a> ), as did John ( <a ref='Revelation 13:14–15'>Rev 13:14–15</a> )—when the Antichrist sets up an image in the temple during the future tribulation. Christ’s words here therefore look beyond the events of AD 70 to a time of even greater global cataclysm that will immediately precede His coming (cf. vv. <a ref='Matthew 24:29–31'>29–31</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 24:16'>24:16</a> <b>the mountains.</b> Probably a reference to the region southeast of Jerusalem, particularly the Dead Sea area, where there are many caves and places of refuge. David hid from Saul in this area ( <a ref='1 Samuel 23:29'>1Sa 23:29</a> ). This would also include the hills of Moab and Edom. <a ref='Matthew 24:21'>24:21</a> <b>great tribulation.</b> The words “such as has not occurred” and “nor ever will”—along with the description that follows—identify this as the yet-future time in which God’s wrath shall be poured out upon the earth ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 7:14'>Rev 7:14</a></i> ). Jesus’ descriptions of the cataclysms that follow closely resemble the outpouring of divine wrath described in the bowl judgments of <a ref='Rev 16'>Rev 16</a> and His subsequent appearing in <a ref='Rev 19'>Rev 19</a> ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 24:30'>30</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 24:22'>24:22</a> <b>those days had been cut short.</b> If the afflictions of this time were to continue, “no life would have been saved,” i.e., no one would survive. But “for the sake of the elect” (so that redeemed people do not suffer more than they can bear) the time is “cut short”—i.e., held short of total destruction. Both <a ref='Daniel 7:25'>Da 7:25</a> and <a ref='Revelation 12:14'>Rev 12:14</a> ( <i>see notes there</i> ) suggest that the actual length of time the Beast will be permitted to terrorize the world is fixed at 3 1/2 years. <a ref='Matthew 24:24'>24:24</a> <b>to deceive, if possible, even the elect.</b> This clearly implies that such deception is not possible ( <a ref='John 10:4–5'>Jn 10:4–5</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 24:26'>24:26</a> <b>do not believe</b> them <b>.</b> No one should consider the claims of self-styled messiahs because all of them are false. When Christ returns, no one will miss it (vv. <a ref='Matthew 24:27–28'>27–28</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 24:28'>24:28</a> <b>there the vultures will gather.</b> The location of a carcass is visible from great distances because of the circling carrion birds overhead (cf. <a ref='Job 39:27–30'>Job 39:27–30</a> ). Similarly, Christ’s return will be clearly evident to all near and far. The same point is made by the lightning in v. <a ref='Matthew 24:27'>27</a> . The vulture-dead body imagery here also speaks of the judgment that will accompany His return ( <a ref='Revelation 19:21'>Rev 19:21</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 24:29'>24:29</a> the sun will be darkened <b>.</b> Such phenomena are a common feature of day of the Lord prophecy (see <a ref='Isaiah 13:9–10'>Is 13:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 32:7–8'>Eze 32:7–8</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:10'>Joel 2:10</a> , <a ref='Joel 2:31'>31</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:15'>3:15</a> ; <a ref='Amos 8:9'>Am 8:9</a> ). The ultimate fulfillment of these prophecies takes place during the time of the Beast’s reign ( <a ref='Revelation 6:12–13'>Rev 6:12–13</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 8:12'>8:12</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 24:30'>24:30</a> <b>the sign of the Son of Man.</b> I.e., the Son of Man Himself is the sign. The events described here precisely parallel the description in <a ref='Daniel 7:13'>Da 7:13</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:11–21'>Rev 19:11–21</a> . <b>all the tribes of the earth will mourn.</b> I.e., over their own rebellion. Israel in particular will mourn over their rejection of the Messiah (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–12'>Zec 12:10–12</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 24:31'>24:31</a> <b>from one end of the sky to the other.</b> All the “elect” from heaven and earth are gathered and assembled before Christ. This is the culmination of world history, ushering in the millennial reign of Christ (cf. <a ref='Revelation 20:4'>Rev 20:4</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 24:32'>24:32</a> <b>parable from the fig tree.</b> When the fig branch “puts forth its leaves,” only a short time remains until summer. Likewise, when the final labor pains begin ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 24:14'>14</a></i> ), Christ’s return “is near, right at the door” (v. <a ref='Matthew 24:33'>33</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 24:34'>24:34</a> <b>this generation.</b> This cannot refer to the generation living at the time of Christ, for “all these things”—the abomination of desolation (v. <a ref='Matthew 24:15'>15</a> ), the persecutions and judgments (vv. <a ref='Matthew 24:17–22'>17–22</a> ), the false prophets (vv. <a ref='Matthew 24:23–26'>23–26</a> ), the signs in the heavens (vv. <a ref='Matthew 24:27–29'>27–29</a> ), Christ’s final return (v. <a ref='Matthew 24:30'>30</a> ), and the gathering of the elect (v. <a ref='Matthew 24:31'>31</a> )—did not “take place” in their lifetime. It seems best to interpret Christ’s words as a reference to the generation alive at the time when those final hard labor pains begin ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 24:14'>14</a></i> ). This would fit with the lesson of the fig tree, which stresses the short span of time in which these things will occur ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 24:32'>32</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 24:35'>24:35</a> <b>Heaven and earth will pass away.</b> Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 24:18–20'>Is 24:18–20</a> . <i>See notes on <a ref='2 Peter 3:10–13'>2Pe 3:10–13</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 24:36'>24:36</a> <b>day and hour.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Mark 13:32'>Mk 13:32</a> .</i> The disciples wanted to fix the precise time, but this was not for them to know ( <a ref='Acts 1:7'>Ac 1:7</a> ). Christ’s emphasis instead is on faithfulness, watchfulness, stewardship, expectancy, and preparedness. These are the lessons He taught in the parables that immediately follow. <a ref='Matthew 24:37'>24:37</a> <b>just as the days of Noah.</b> Jesus’ emphasis here is not so much on the extreme wickedness of Noah’s day ( <a ref='Genesis 6:5'>Ge 6:5</a> ), but on the people’s preoccupation with mundane matters of everyday life (“eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage”—v. <a ref='Matthew 24:38'>38</a> ), when judgment fell suddenly. They had received warnings, in the form of Noah’s preaching ( <a ref='2 Peter 2:5'>2Pe 2:5</a> )—and the ark itself, which was a testimony to the judgment that was to come. But they were unconcerned about such matters and therefore were swept away unexpectedly in the midst of their daily activities. <a ref='Matthew 24:40–41'>24:40–41</a> <b>one will be taken.</b> I.e., taken in judgment (cf. v. <a ref='Matthew 24:39'>39</a> ) just as in Noah’s day (“took them”; v. <a ref='Matthew 24:39'>39</a> ). This is clearly not a reference to the catching away of believers described in <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:16–17'>1Th 4:16–17</a> . <a ref='Matthew 24:43'>24:43</a> <b>the thief.</b> As no one knows what hour the thief will come, no one knows the hour of the Lord’s return or the day of the Lord that accompanies His coming (cf. <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:2'>1Th 5:2</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 3:10'>2Pe 3:10</a> ). But the believer is to be ready at all times. <a ref='Matthew 24:44'>24:44</a> <b>at an hour when you do not think</b> He will <b>.</b> The parables that follow teach Christ’s followers to be ready in case He comes sooner than anticipated (vv. <a ref='Matthew 24:43–51'>43–51</a> ); and also to be prepared in case He delays longer than expected ( <a ref='Matthew 25:1–13'>25:1–13</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 24:45–51'>24:45–51</a> The evil slave represents an unbeliever who refuses to take seriously the promise of Christ’s return (cf. <a ref='2 Peter 3:4'>2Pe 3:4</a> ). Though he is an unbeliever (as demonstrated by his punishment— <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 22:13'>22:13</a></i> ), he is nonetheless accountable to Christ for the stewardship of his time. Jesus was teaching that every person in the world holds his life, natural abilities, wealth, and possessions in trust from God and must give account of how these things are used. <a ref='Matthew 24:51'>24:51</a> <b>weeping and gnashing of teeth.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 22:13'>22:13</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 25:1–13'>25:1–13</a> The parable of the 10 virgins is given to underscore the importance of being ready for Christ’s return in any event—even if He delays longer than expected. For when He does return, there will be no second chances for the unprepared (vv. <a ref='Matthew 25:11–12'>11–12</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 25:1'>25:1</a> <b>ten virgins.</b> I.e., bridesmaids. The wedding would begin at the bride’s house when the bridegroom arrived to observe the wedding ritual. Then a procession would follow as the bridegroom took the bride to his house for the completion of festivities. For a night wedding, “lamps,” which were actually torches, were needed for the procession. <a ref='Matthew 25:14–30'>25:14–30</a> The parable of the talents illustrates the tragedy of wasted opportunity. The man who goes on the journey represents Christ, and the slaves represent professing believers given different levels of responsibility. Faithfulness is what he demands of them ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 25:23'>23</a></i> ), but the parable suggests that all who are faithful will be fruitful to some degree. The fruitless person is unmasked as a hypocrite and utterly destroyed (v. <a ref='Matthew 25:30'>30</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 25:15'>25:15</a> <b>talents.</b> A talent was a measure of weight, not a specific coin, so that a talent of gold was more valuable than a talent of silver. A talent of silver (the word translated “money” in v. <a ref='Matthew 25:18'>18</a> is lit. silver) was a considerable sum of money. The modern meaning of the word “talent,” denoting a natural ability, stems from the fact that this parable is erroneously applied to the stewardship of one’s natural gifts. <a ref='Matthew 25:23'>25:23</a> <b>the joy of your master.</b> Both the man with 5 talents and the man with two received exactly the same reward, indicating that the reward is based on faithfulness, not results. <a ref='Matthew 25:24'>25:24</a> <b>a hard man.</b> His characterization of the master maligns the man as a cruel and ruthless opportunist, “reaping and gathering” what he had no right to claim as his own. This slothful servant does not represent a genuine believer, for it is obvious that this man had no true knowledge of the master. <a ref='Matthew 25:26'>25:26</a> <b>you knew that I reap where I did not sow.</b> In repeating the slave’s charge against him, the master was not acknowledging that it was true. He was allowing the man’s own words to condemn him. If the slave really believed the master to be the kind of man he portrayed, that was all the more reason for him not to be slothful. His accusation against the master—even if it had been true—did not justify his own laziness. <a ref='Matthew 25:29'>25:29</a> <b>to everyone who has,</b> more <b>shall be given.</b> See <a ref='Matthew 13:12'>13:12</a> . The recipients of divine grace inherit immeasurable blessings in addition to eternal life and the favor of God (cf. <a ref='Romans 8:32'>Ro 8:32</a> ). But those who despise the riches of God’s goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering ( <a ref='Romans 2:4'>Ro 2:4</a> ), burying them in the ground and clinging instead to the paltry and transient goods of this world, will ultimately lose everything they have (cf. <a ref='Matthew 6:19'>6:19</a> ; <a ref='John 12:25'>Jn 12:25</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 25:30'>25:30</a> <b>outer darkness … weeping and gnashing of teeth.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 22:13'>22:13</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 25:31'>25:31</a> <b>He will sit on His glorious throne.</b> This speaks of the earthly reign of Christ described in <a ref='Revelation 20:4–6'>Rev 20:4–6</a> . The judgment described here in vv. <a ref='Matthew 25:32–46'>32–46</a> is different from the Great White Throne judgment of <a ref='Revelation 20:11–15'>Rev 20:11–15</a> . This judgment precedes Christ’s millennial reign, and the subjects seem to be only those who are alive at His coming. This is sometimes referred to as the judgment of the nations, but His verdicts address individuals in the nations, not the nations as a whole (cf. v. <a ref='Matthew 25:46'>46</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 25:32–33'>25:32–33</a> <b>sheep.</b> I.e., believers ( <a ref='Matthew 10:16'>10:16</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 79:13'>Ps 79:13</a> ; <a ref='Eze 34'>Eze 34</a> ). They are given the place on “His right”—the place of favor. <b>goats.</b> These represent unbelievers, consigned to the place of dishonor and rejection. <a ref='Matthew 25:34'>25:34</a> <b>prepared for you.</b> This terminology underscores that their salvation is a gracious gift of God, not something merited by the deeds described in vv. <a ref='Matthew 25:35–36'>35–36</a> . Before “the foundation of the world,” they were chosen by God and ordained to be holy ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:4'>Eph 1:4</a> )—predestined to be conformed to Christ’s image ( <a ref='Romans 8:29'>Ro 8:29</a> ). So the good deeds commended in vv. <a ref='Matthew 25:35–36'>35–36</a> are the fruit, not the root of their salvation. The deeds are not the basis for their entrance into the kingdom, but merely manifestations of God’s grace in their lives. They are the objective criteria for judgment, because they are the evidence of saving faith (cf. <a ref='James 2:14–26'>Jas 2:14–26</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 25:40'>25:40</a> <b>one of these brothers of Mine.</b> This refers in particular to other disciples. Some would apply this to national Israel; others to needy people in general. But here Christ is specifically commending “those on His right” (v. <a ref='Matthew 25:34'>34</a> ) for the way they received His emissaries. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 18:5'>18:5</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 25:46'>25:46</a> <b>eternal punishment … eternal life.</b> The same Greek word is used in both instances. The punishment of the wicked is as never-ending as the bliss of the righteous. The wicked are not given a second chance, nor are they annihilated. The punishment of the wicked dead is described throughout Scripture as “eternal fire” (v. <a ref='Matthew 25:41'>41</a> ); “unquenchable fire” ( <a ref='Matthew 3:12'>3:12</a> ); “reproach and everlasting contempt” ( <a ref='Daniel 12:2'>Da 12:2</a> ); a place where “their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched” ( <a ref='Mark 9:44–49'>Mk 9:44–49</a> ); a place of “torments” and “flame” ( <a ref='Luke 16:23–24'>Lk 16:23–24</a> ); “eternal destruction” ( <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:9'>2Th 1:9</a> ); a place of torment with “fire and brimstone” where “the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever” ( <a ref='Revelation 14:10–11'>Rev 14:10–11</a> ); and a “lake of fire and brimstone” where the wicked are “tormented day and night forever and ever” ( <a ref='Revelation 20:10'>Rev 20:10</a> ). Here Jesus indicates that the punishment itself is everlasting—not merely the smoke and flames. The wicked are forever subject to the fury and the wrath of God. They consciously suffer shame and contempt and the assaults of an accusing conscience—along with the fiery wrath of an offended deity—for all of eternity. Even hell will acknowledge the perfect justice of God ( <a ref='Psalms 76:10'>Ps 76:10</a> ); those who are there will know that their punishment is just and that they alone are to blame (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:3–5'>Dt 32:3–5</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 26:2'>26:2</a> <b>Passover.</b> This was God’s chosen time for Christ to die. He was the antitype to which the Passover Lamb had always referred. Christ had always avoided His enemies’ plots to kill Him ( <a ref='Luke 4:29–30'>Lk 4:29–30</a> ; <a ref='John 5:18'>Jn 5:18</a> ; <a ref='John 10:39'>10:39</a> ), but now it was His time ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 26:5'>5</a></i> ). The true Lamb of God would take away the sin of the world ( <a ref='John 1:29'>Jn 1:29</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 26:3'>26:3</a> <b>Caiaphas.</b> Caiaphas served as High Priest from AD 18 to 36, an unusually long tenure for anyone in that role. His longevity suggests he had a close relationship with both Rome and the Herodian dynasty. He was son-in-law to his predecessor, Annas ( <a ref='John 18:13'>Jn 18:13</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 3:2'>Lk 3:2</a></i> ). He controlled the temple and no doubt personally profited from the corrupt merchandising that was taking place there ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 21:12'>21:12</a></i> ). His enmity against Jesus seems intensely personal and especially malevolent; every time he appears in Scripture, he is seeking Jesus’ destruction. <a ref='Matthew 26:5'>26:5</a> <b>Not during the festival.</b> The Jewish leaders, who had been eager to kill Him for so long, decided to postpone their plot until a more politically opportune time. But they could not; God’s chosen time had come ( <i>see notes on vv. <a ref='Matthew 26:2'>2</a> , <a ref='Matthew 26:18'>18</a> , <a ref='Matthew 26:54'>54</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 26:6'>26:6</a> <b>Simon the leper.</b> Simon was almost certainly someone whom Jesus had healed of leprosy, for lepers were deemed unclean and therefore not permitted to socialize or even live in cities. <i>See note on <a ref='Leviticus 13:2'>Lv 13:2</a></i> for a discussion on leprosy. <a ref='Matthew 26:7'>26:7</a> <b>an alabaster jar of very costly perfume.</b> Mark sets the value at “over three hundred denarii” ( <i>see note on <a ref='Mark 14:5'>Mk 14:5</a></i> ), nearly a year’s wages—very costly indeed. Even the expensive flask was broken ( <a ref='Mark 14:3'>Mk 14:3</a> ), making the act that much more costly. “Alabaster” was a fine variety of marble, quarried in Egypt, which could be carved into delicate containers for storing costly perfumes. John tells us this woman was Mary, sister of Martha and Lazarus ( <a ref='John 12:3'>Jn 12:3</a> ); thus Martha and Mary were evidently serving the meal for Simon the leper. Matthew and Mark mention that she anointed His head. John adds that she anointed His feet and wiped them with her hair. A similar act of worship is related in <a ref='Luke 7:36–38'>Lk 7:36–38</a> , but the differences in timing, location, and other details make it clear that the two occasions were different. <a ref='Matthew 26:8'>26:8</a> <b>the disciples … were indignant.</b> John says Judas was the spokesman who voiced the complaint, and that he did it for hypocritical reasons ( <a ref='John 12:4–6'>Jn 12:4–6</a> ). Evidently the other disciples, being undiscerning, were quick to voice sympathy with Judas’ protest. <a ref='Matthew 26:11'>26:11</a> <b>For you always have the poor with you.</b> Jesus certainly was not disparaging ministry to the poor—especially so soon after the lesson of the sheep and goats judgment (cf. <a ref='Matthew 25:35–36'>25:35–36</a> ). However, He revealed here that there is a higher priority than any other earthly ministry, and that is worship rendered to Him. This would be an utter blasphemy for anyone less than God, so yet again He was implicitly affirming His deity ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 8:27'>8:27</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 12:6'>12:6</a> , <a ref='Matthew 12:8'>8</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 21:16'>21:16</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 22:42'>22:42</a> , <a ref='Matthew 22:45'>45</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 26:12'>26:12</a> <b>she did it to prepare Me for burial.</b> This does not necessarily mean that Mary was consciously aware of the significance of her act. It is doubtful that she knew of His approaching death, or at least how close it was. But this was an act of pure worship, her heart having been moved by God to perform a sacrificial and symbolic act, the full significance of which she probably did not know. <a ref='Matthew 26:13'>26:13</a> <b>in memory of her.</b> This promise was guaranteed by the inclusion of this story in the NT. <a ref='Matthew 26:15'>26:15</a> <b>thirty pieces of silver.</b> The price of a slave ( <a ref='Exodus 21:32'>Ex 21:32</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 26:17'>26:17</a> <b>the first</b> day <b>of Unleavened Bread.</b> The Passover lambs were killed ( <a ref='Mark 14:12'>Mk 14:12</a> ) on 14 Nisan (Mar./Apr.). That evening, the Passover meal was eaten. The Feast of Unleavened Bread followed immediately after Passover, from 15–21 Nisan. The entire time was often referred to either as “Passover” ( <a ref='Luke 22:1'>Lk 22:1</a> ), or as the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Therefore the first day refers to 14 Nisan. See Introduction to John: Interpretive Challenges ; <i>see note on <a ref='John 19:14'>Jn 19:14</a></i> . <a ref='Matthew 26:18'>26:18</a> <b>a certain man.</b> <a ref='Mark 14:13'>Mark 14:13</a> and <a ref='Luke 22:10'>Lk 22:10</a> say they would be able to identify the man because he would be “carrying a pitcher of water,” a chore normally reserved for women. He was evidently someone they did not know, probably a servant of whoever owned the house with an “upper room,” where the Passover meal was to be eaten ( <a ref='Mark 14:15'>Mk 14:15</a> ; <a ref='Luke 22:12'>Lk 22:12</a> ). Jesus had evidently made these arrangements clandestinely, in order to prevent His premature betrayal. Had Judas known ahead of time where the meal was to be eaten, he would surely have alerted the chief priests and elders (see vv. <a ref='Matthew 26:14–16'>14–16</a> ). But none of these things were to happen until the “time” was “near.” All of this reveals how Jesus Himself was sovereignly in control of the details of His own crucifixion ( <i>see notes on vv. <a ref='Matthew 26:5'>5</a> , <a ref='Matthew 26:54'>54</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 26:20'>26:20</a> <b>was reclining.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Mark 14:18'>Mk 14:18</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='John 13:25'>Jn 13:25</a> . <a ref='Matthew 26:26'>26:26</a> <b>Take, eat; this is My body.</b> Jesus thus transformed the last Passover into the first observance of the Lord’s Supper. He is the central antitype in both ceremonies, being represented symbolically by both the paschal lamb of the Passover and the elements in the communion service. His statement, “this is My body” could not possibly have been taken in any literal sense by the disciples present that evening. <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 22:19'>Lk 22:19</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 26:28'>26:28</a> <b>My blood of the covenant.</b> Covenants were ratified with the blood of a sacrifice ( <a ref='Genesis 8:20'>Ge 8:20</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 15:9–10'>15:9–10</a> ). Jesus’ words here echo Moses’ pronouncement in <a ref='Exodus 24:8'>Ex 24:8</a> . The blood of the New Covenant is not an animal’s blood, but Christ’s own blood, shed for the remission of sins. <i>See notes on <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer 31:31–34</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 8:1–10:18'>Heb 8:1—10:18</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 8:6'>8:6</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 26:29'>26:29</a> <b>My Father’s kingdom.</b> I.e., the earthly millennial kingdom (see <a ref='Luke 22:18'>Lk 22:18</a> , <a ref='Luke 22:29–30'>29–30</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 26:30'>26:30</a> <b>after singing a hymn.</b> Probably <a ref='Ps 118'>Ps 118</a> . The Talmud designated <a ref='Ps 113-118'>Pss 113–118</a> as the Hallel (praise psalms) of Egypt. These psalms were sung at Passover ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Ps 113-118'>Pss 113–118</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 26:31'>26:31</a> <b>fall away.</b> See v. <a ref='Matthew 26:56'>56</a> . The Greek word is the same word Jesus used in <a ref='Matthew 24:10'>24:10</a> , describing the falling away and spiritual treachery that would occur in the last days. Here, however, Jesus spoke of something less than full and final apostasy. In a moment of fleshly fear they disowned Christ (v. <a ref='Matthew 26:34'>34</a> ), but He prayed that their faith would not fail ( <a ref='Luke 22:32'>Lk 22:32</a> ; <a ref='John 17:9–11'>Jn 17:9–11</a> ), and that prayer was answered. The verse Jesus quotes here is <a ref='Zechariah 13:7'>Zec 13:7</a> ( <i>see note there</i> ). <a ref='Matthew 26:32'>26:32</a> <b>I will go ahead of you to Galilee.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 28:7'>28:7</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 26:34'>26:34</a> <b>before a rooster crows.</b> Mark adds “twice.” The rooster would begin crowing about 3:00 a.m. (cf. <a ref='Mark 13:35'>Mk 13:35</a> ). Though Peter and all the disciples insisted that they would never deny Christ (vv. <a ref='Matthew 26:33'>33</a> , <a ref='Matthew 26:35'>35</a> ), they were only a few hours away from fulfilling this prophecy (vv. <a ref='Matthew 26:74–75'>74–75</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:66–72'>Mk 14:66–72</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 26:36'>26:36</a> <b>Gethsemane.</b> Lit. “oil press.” This was a frequent meeting place for Christ and His disciples ( <a ref='John 18:2'>Jn 18:2</a> ), just across the Kidron Valley from Jerusalem ( <a ref='John 18:1'>Jn 18:1</a> ). A garden of ancient olive trees is there to this day. Judas’ familiarity with Jesus’ patterns enabled him to find Jesus there—even though Christ had not previously announced His intentions. <a ref='Matthew 26:38'>26:38</a> <b>grieved, to the point of death.</b> His anguish had nothing to do with fear of men or the physical torments of the cross. He was sorrowful because within hours the full cup of divine fury against sin would be His to drink ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 26:39'>39</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 26:39'>26:39</a> <b>this cup.</b> Cf. v. <a ref='Matthew 26:42'>42</a> . A cup is often the symbol of divine wrath against sin in the OT ( <a ref='Isaiah 51:17'>Is 51:17</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 51:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 25:15–17'>Jer 25:15–17</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 25:27–29'>27–29</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 4:21–22'>Lam 4:21–22</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 23:31–34'>Eze 23:31–34</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 2:16'>Hab 2:16</a> ). The next day Christ would “bear the sins of many” ( <a ref='Hebrews 9:28'>Heb 9:28</a> )—and the fullness of divine wrath would fall on Him ( <a ref='Isaiah 53:10–11'>Is 53:10–11</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ). This was the price of the sin He bore, and He paid it in full. His cry of anguish in <a ref='Matthew 27:46'>27:46</a> reflects the extreme bitterness of the cup of wrath He was given. <b>not as I will, but as You will.</b> This implies no conflict between the Persons of the Godhead. Rather, it graphically reveals how Christ in His humanity voluntarily surrendered His will to the will of the Father in all things—precisely so that there would be no conflict between the divine will and His desires. See <a ref='John 4:34'>Jn 4:34</a> ; <a ref='John 6:38'>6:38</a> ; <a ref='John 8:29'>8:29</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 2:8'>Php 2:8</a> . <i>See note on <a ref='John 5:30'>Jn 5:30</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 26:41'>26:41</a> <b>the flesh is weak.</b> The tenderness of this plea is touching. Christ Himself was well acquainted with the feeling of human infirmities ( <a ref='Hebrews 4:15'>Heb 4:15</a> )—yet without sin. At that very moment He was locked in a struggle against human passions which, while not sinful in themselves, must be subjugated to the divine will if sin was to be avoided. <i>See note on v. <a ref='Matthew 26:39'>39</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 26:47'>26:47</a> <b>Judas, one of the twelve.</b> See v. <a ref='Matthew 26:14'>14</a> .

Only once ( <a ref='John 20:24'>Jn 20:24</a> ) is another disciple so described. The Gospel writers seem to use the expression to underscore the insidiousness of Judas’ crime—especially here, in the midst of the betrayal. <a ref='Matthew 26:48–49'>26:48–49</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Mark 14:44–45'>Mk 14:44–45</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 26:50'>26:50</a> <b>Friend.</b> Not the usual Greek word for “friend,” but another word meaning “comrade.” <a ref='Matthew 26:51'>26:51</a> <b>one of those.</b> John identifies the swordsman as Peter and the victim as Malchus ( <a ref='John 18:10'>Jn 18:10</a> ). Clearly, Peter was not aiming for the ear, but for the head. Only Luke mentions that Jesus healed Malchus’ ear ( <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 22:51'>Lk 22:51</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 26:52'>26:52</a> <b>perish by the sword.</b> Peter’s action was vigilantism. No matter how unjust the arrest of Jesus, Peter had no right to take the law into his own hands in order to stop it. Jesus’ reply was a restatement of the <a ref='Genesis 9:6'>Ge 9:6</a> principle: “Whoever sheds man’s blood, by man his blood shall be shed,” an affirmation that capital punishment is an appropriate penalty for murder. <a ref='Matthew 26:53'>26:53</a> <b>more than twelve legions.</b> A Roman legion was composed of 6,000 soldiers, so this would represent more than 72,000 angels. In <a ref='2 Kings 19:35'>2Ki 19:35</a> a single angel killed more than 185,000 men in a single night, so this many angels would make a formidable army. <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 2:13'>Lk 2:13</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 26:54'>26:54</a> <b>Scriptures be fulfilled.</b> God Himself had foreordained the very minutest details of how Jesus would die ( <a ref='Acts 2:23'>Ac 2:23</a> ; <a ref='Acts 4:27–28'>4:27–28</a> ). Dying was Christ’s consummate act of submission to the Father’s will ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 26:39'>39</a></i> ). Jesus Himself was in absolute control ( <a ref='John 10:17–18'>Jn 10:17–18</a> ). Yet it was not Jesus alone, but everyone around Him—His enemies included—who fulfilled precisely the details of the OT prophecies. These events display His divine sovereignty. <i>See notes on v. <a ref='Matthew 26:2'>2</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 1:22'>1:22</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 5:18'>5:18</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 27:50'>27:50</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 26:57'>26:57</a> <b>Caiaphas, the high priest.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Matthew 26:3'>3</a> .</i> From <a ref='John 18:13'>Jn 18:13</a> , we learn that Christ was taken first to Annas (former High Priest and father-in-law to Caiaphas). He then was sent bound to Caiaphas’ house ( <a ref='John 18:24'>Jn 18:24</a> ). The conspiracy was well planned, so that “the scribes and the elders” (the Sanhedrin, <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 26:59'>59</a></i> ) were already “gathered” at Caiaphas’ house and ready to try Jesus. The time was sometime between midnight and the first rooster’s crowing (v. <a ref='Matthew 26:74'>74</a> ). Such a hearing was illegal on several counts: criminal trials were not to be held at night ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 27:1'>27:1</a></i> ); and trials in capital cases could only be held at the temple and only in public. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 27:2'>27:2</a></i> for a fuller chronology of the events leading up to the crucifixion. Jesus’ Trial, Judgment, and Crucifixion Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Matthew 26:59'>26:59</a> <b>the whole Sanhedrin.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='John 3:1'>Jn 3:1</a> .</i> The great Sanhedrin was the Supreme Court of Israel, consisting of 71 members, presided over by the High Priest. They met daily in the temple to hold court, except on the Sabbath and other holy days. Technically, they did not have the power to administer capital punishment ( <a ref='John 18:31'>Jn 18:31</a> ), but in the case of Stephen, for example, this was no deterrent to his stoning (cf. <a ref='Acts 6:12–14'>Ac 6:12–14</a> ; <a ref='Acts 7:58–60'>7:58–60</a> ). Roman governors evidently sometimes ignored such incidents as a matter of political expediency. In Jesus’ case, the men who were trying Him were the same ones who had conspired against Him (cf. <a ref='John 11:47–50'>Jn 11:47–50</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 26:60'>26:60</a> <b>did not find</b> any <b>.</b> Even though many were willing to perjure themselves, the Sanhedrin could not find a charge that had enough credibility to indict Jesus.

The witnesses’ account was a distortion of Jesus’ meaning. <a ref='Mark 14:58'>Mark 14:58</a> gives a fuller account of their testimony. <a ref='Matthew 26:63'>26:63</a> <b>put You under oath.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 5:34'>5:34</a> .</i> Caiaphas was trying to break Jesus’ silence (v. <a ref='Matthew 26:62'>62</a> ) by placing Him under oath. The oath was supposed to make Him legally obligated to reply. Jesus’ answer (v. <a ref='Matthew 26:64'>64</a> ) implies acceptance of the oath. <a ref='Matthew 26:64'>26:64</a> The imagery was taken from <a ref='Psalms 110:1'>Ps 110:1</a> and <a ref='Daniel 7:13'>Da 7:13</a> . <a ref='Matthew 26:65'>26:65</a> <b>the high priest tore his garments.</b> Normally, this was an expression of deep grief ( <a ref='2 Kings 19:1'>2Ki 19:1</a> ; <a ref='Job 1:20'>Job 1:20</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 36:24'>Jer 36:24</a> ). The High Priest was forbidden to tear his clothes ( <a ref='Leviticus 10:6'>Lv 10:6</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 21:10'>21:10</a> )—but the Talmud made an exception for High Priests who witnessed a blasphemy. But Caiaphas’ supposed grief was as phony as the charge of blasphemy against Jesus; he was gloating over having found something to base his charges on (v. <a ref='Matthew 26:67'>67</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 26:74'>26:74</a> <b>he began to curse and swear.</b> I.e., calling on God as his witness, Peter declared, “I do not know the man!” and pronounced a curse of death on himself at God’s hand if his words were untrue. All 4 Gospels record Peter’s betrayal.

This account reminds us of not only our own weakness, but also the richness of divine grace (see also <a ref='John 21:15–19'>Jn 21:15–19</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 27:1'>27:1</a> <b>when morning came.</b> The Sanhedrin waited until daybreak to render their official verdict (cf. <a ref='Matthew 26:66'>26:66</a> ), possibly a token nod to the rule against criminal trials at night ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 26:57'>26:57</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 27:2'>27:2</a> <b>delivered Him to Pilate.</b> Jesus had two trials, one Jewish and religious, the other Roman and secular. Rome reserved the right of execution in capital cases ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 26:59'>26:59</a></i> ), so Jesus had to be handed over to the Roman authorities for execution of the death sentence. Pilate’s headquarters were in Caesarea, on the Mediterranean coast, but he was in Jerusalem for the Passover celebrations, so he oversaw the trial ( <i>see note on <a ref='Mark 15:1'>Mk 15:1</a></i> ). Christ was brought before Pilate (vv. <a ref='Matthew 27:2–14'>2–14</a> ), then was sent to Herod for yet another hearing ( <a ref='Luke 23:6–12'>Lk 23:6–12</a> ), then returned to Pilate for the final hearing and pronouncing of sentence (vv. <a ref='Matthew 27:15–26'>15–26</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 27:3'>27:3</a> <b>remorse.</b> Judas felt the sting of his own guilt, but this was not genuine repentance. There is a godly sorrow that leads to repentance, but Judas’ remorse was of a different kind, as demonstrated by his suicide (v. <a ref='Matthew 27:5'>5</a> ). Cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 7:10'>2Co 7:10</a> . <a ref='Matthew 27:5'>27:5</a> <b>hanged himself.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 1:18'>Ac 1:18</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 27:9'>27:9</a> <b>spoken through Jeremiah.</b> Actually the statement paraphrases <a ref='Zechariah 11:12–13'>Zec 11:12–13</a> . But the Hebrew canon was divided into 3 sections, Law, Writings, and Prophets (cf. <a ref='Luke 24:44'>Lk 24:44</a> ). Jeremiah came first in the order of prophetic books, so the Prophets were sometimes collectively referred to by his name. <a ref='Matthew 27:11'>27:11</a> <b>You yourself say</b> it <b>.</b> These words were probably spoken immediately after the dialogue <a ref='John 18:34–36'>Jn 18:34–36</a> reports. <a ref='Matthew 27:25'>27:25</a> <b>His blood be on us.</b> The Jews accepted the blame for the execution of Jesus and did not hold the Romans responsible. Cf. <a ref='Matthew 21:38–39'>21:38–39</a> . <a ref='Matthew 27:26'>27:26</a> <b>scourged.</b> The whip used for scourging consisted of several strands of leather attached to a wooden handle. Each strand had a bit of metal or bone attached to the end. The victim was bound to a post by the wrists, high over his head, so that the flesh of the back would be taut. An expert at wielding the scourge could literally tear the flesh from the back, lacerating muscles, and sometimes even exposing the kidneys or other internal organs. Scourging alone was fatal in some cases. <a ref='Matthew 27:27'>27:27</a> <b>Praetorium.</b> Pilate’s residence in Jerusalem. It was probably located in the Antonia Fortress, adjacent to the northwest corner of the temple. “The soldiers of the governor” were part of a “cohort”—about 600 soldiers—assigned to serve the governor (Pilate) during his stay in Jerusalem. <a ref='Matthew 27:28'>27:28</a> <b>scarlet robe.</b> <a ref='Mark 15:17'>Mark 15:17</a> and <a ref='John 19:2'>Jn 19:2</a> say “purple,” suggesting that the robe may have been something between royal purple, and “scarlet,” the closest thing they could find to the traditional garb of royalty. The word for “robe” refers to a military cloak undoubtedly belonging to one of the soldiers. <a ref='Matthew 27:29'>27:29</a> <b>a reed in His right hand.</b> To imitate a scepter they purposely chose something flimsy-looking. <a ref='Matthew 27:30'>27:30</a> <b>they spat on Him.</b> See <a ref='Isaiah 50:6'>Is 50:6</a> . <b>beat Him on the head.</b> A reed long enough to make a mock scepter would be firm enough to be extremely painful, about like a broom handle. <a ref='John 19:3'>Jn 19:3</a> says they hit Him with their fists as well. <a ref='Matthew 27:31'>27:31</a> <b>to crucify Him.</b> Crucifixion was a form of punishment that had been passed down to the Romans from the Persians, Phoenicians, and Carthaginians. Roman crucifixion was a lingering doom—by design. Roman executioners had perfected the art of slow torture while keeping the victim alive. Some victims even lingered until they were eaten alive by birds of prey or wild beasts. Most hung on the cross for days before dying of exhaustion, dehydration, traumatic fever, or—most likely—suffocation. When the legs would no longer support the weight of the body, the diaphragm was constricted in a way that made breathing impossible. That is why breaking the legs would hasten death ( <a ref='John 19:31–33'>Jn 19:31–33</a> ), but this was unnecessary in Jesus’ case. The hands were usually nailed through the wrists, and the feet through the instep or the Achilles tendon (sometimes using one nail for both feet). None of these wounds would be fatal, but their pain would become unbearable as the hours dragged on. The most notable feature of crucifixion was the stigma of disgrace that was attached to it ( <a ref='Galatians 3:13'>Ga 3:13</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 5:11'>5:11</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 12:2'>Heb 12:2</a> ). One indignity was the humiliation of carrying one’s own cross, which might weigh as much as 200 pounds. Normally a quaternion, 4 soldiers, would escort the prisoner through the crowds to the place of crucifixion. A placard bearing the indictment would be hung around the person’s neck. <a ref='Matthew 27:32'>27:32</a> <b>Cyrene.</b> A city in north Africa. Evidently the scourging had so weakened Jesus that He was unable to carry the cross. This is another touching picture of His humanity, beset with all human weaknesses except sin ( <a ref='Hebrews 4:15'>Heb 4:15</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 27:33'>27:33</a> <b>Place of a Skull.</b> “Golgotha” may have been a skull-shaped hill, or it may have been so named because as a place of crucifixion, it accumulated skulls. None of the Gospels mention a hill. <a ref='Matthew 27:34'>27:34</a> <b>wine … mixed with gall.</b> “Gall” simply refers to something bitter. <a ref='Mark 15:23'>Mark 15:23</a> identifies it as myrrh, a narcotic. The Jews had a custom, based on <a ref='Proverbs 31:6'>Pr 31:6</a> , of administering a pain-deadening medication mixed with wine to victims of crucifixion, in order to deaden the pain. Tasting what it was, Christ, though thirsty, “did not want to drink,” lest it dull His senses before He completed His work. The lessening of physical pain would probably not have diminished the efficacy of His atoning work ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 26:38–39'>26:38–39</a></i> ). But He needed His full mental faculties for the hours yet to come. It was necessary for Him to be awake and fully conscious, for example, to minister to the dying thief ( <a ref='Luke 23:43'>Lk 23:43</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 27:35'>27:35</a> <b>divided up His garments.</b> The garments of the victim were the customary spoils of the executioners. <a ref='John 19:23–24'>John 19:23–24</a> gives a fuller account. This action was foretold in <a ref='Psalms 22:18'>Ps 22:18</a> . <a ref='Matthew 27:37'>27:37</a> <b>the charge.</b> For a reconciliation of the differences between the various accounts of this inscription, <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 23:38'>Lk 23:38</a></i> (cf. <a ref='Mark 15:26'>Mk 15:26</a> ). The fact that the placard was placed “above His head” suggests that this cross was in the familiar shape with an upright protruding above the transom, and not the T-shaped cross that was also sometimes used. <a ref='Matthew 27:38'>27:38</a> <b>robbers.</b> This word denotes a rebel and brigand who plunders as he steals.

These were probably cohorts of Barabbas. <a ref='Matthew 27:40'>27:40</a> <b>destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days.</b> See <a ref='Matthew 26:61'>26:61</a> . They had missed His point. “He was speaking about the sanctuary of His body” ( <a ref='John 2:21'>Jn 2:21</a> ). He would not “come down from the cross,” but it was not because He was powerless to do so ( <a ref='John 10:18'>Jn 10:18</a> ). The proof that He was the Son of God came “in three days” ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 12:40'>12:40</a></i> ), when He returned with “the sanctuary” (i.e., His body) rebuilt. <a ref='Matthew 27:42'>27:42</a> <b>we will believe in Him.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 12:38'>12:38</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 16:1'>16:1</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 27:45'>27:45</a> <b>from the sixth hour … until the ninth hour.</b> From noon until 3:00 p.m. The crucifixion began at 9:00 a.m. ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Mark 15:25'>Mk 15:25</a> ; <a ref='Luke 23:44'>Lk 23:44</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 27:46'>27:46</a> Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani <b>.</b> “Eli” is Hebrew; the rest Aramaic ( <a ref='Mark 15:34'>Mk 15:34</a> gives the entire wail in Aramaic.) This cry is a fulfillment of <a ref='Psalms 22:1'>Ps 22:1</a> , one of many striking parallels between that psalm and the specific events of the crucifixion ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Ps 22'>Ps 22</a></i> ). Christ at that moment was experiencing the abandonment and despair that resulted from the outpouring of divine wrath on Him as sin-bearer ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 26:39'>26:39</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 27:50'>27:50</a> <b>yielded up His spirit.</b> A voluntary act. See <a ref='John 10:18'>Jn 10:18</a> . <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 26:54'>26:54</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 27:51'>27:51</a> <b>the veil of the sanctuary.</b> I.e., the curtain that blocked the entrance to the Most Holy Place ( <a ref='Exodus 26:33'>Ex 26:33</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:3'>Heb 9:3</a> ). The tearing of the veil signified that the way into God’s presence was now open to all through a new and living way ( <a ref='Hebrews 10:19–22'>Heb 10:19–22</a> ). The fact that it tore “from top to bottom” showed that no man had split the veil. God did it. <a ref='Matthew 27:52'>27:52</a> <b>bodies of the saints … were raised.</b> Matthew alone mentions this miracle. Nothing more is said about these people, which would be unlikely if they remained on earth for long. Evidently, these people were given glorified bodies; they appeared “to many” (v. <a ref='Matthew 27:53'>53</a> ), enough to establish the reality of the miracle; and then they no doubt ascended to glory—a kind of foretaste of <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:16'>1Th 4:16</a> . <a ref='Matthew 27:54'>27:54</a> <b>the centurion.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 8:5'>8:5</a> .</i> <b>those … with him.</b> These were probably men under his charge. <a ref='Mark 15:39'>Mark 15:39</a> says the centurion was the one who uttered the words of confession, but he evidently spoke for his men as well. Their fear speaks of an awareness of their sin, and the word “truly” suggests a certainty and conviction that bespeaks genuine faith. These men represent an answer to Jesus’ prayer in <a ref='Luke 23:34'>Lk 23:34</a> . Their response contrasts sharply with the mocking taunts of vv. <a ref='Matthew 27:39–44'>39–44</a> . <a ref='Matthew 27:56'>27:56</a> <b>Mary Magdalene.</b> She had been delivered from 7 demons ( <a ref='Luke 8:2'>Lk 8:2</a> ); the other “Mary” (“wife of Clopas,” <a ref='John 19:25'>Jn 19:25</a> —a variant of Alphaeus) was the mother of the apostle known as “James the Less” ( <a ref='Mark 15:40'>Mk 15:40</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 10:2'>10:2</a></i> ). <b>the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</b> Salome ( <a ref='Mark 15:40'>Mk 15:40</a> ), mother of James and John. From <a ref='John 19:26'>Jn 19:26</a> , we learn that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was also present at the cross—possibly standing apart from these 3, who were “looking on from a distance” (v. <a ref='Matthew 27:55'>55</a> ), as if they could not bear to watch His sufferings, but neither could they bear to leave Him. <a ref='Matthew 27:57'>27:57</a> <b>Arimathea.</b> A town about 15–20 mi. northwest of Jerusalem. <b>Joseph.</b> <a ref='Mark 15:43'>Mark 15:43</a> and <a ref='Luke 23:50–51'>Luke 23:50–51</a> identify him as a member of the Sanhedrin ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 26:59'>26:59</a></i> ), though Luke says “he had not consented to their counsel and action” in condemning Christ. Joseph and Nicodemus ( <a ref='John 19:39'>Jn 19:39</a> ), both being prominent Jewish leaders, buried Christ in Joseph’s own “new tomb” (v. <a ref='Matthew 27:60'>60</a> ), thus fulfilling exactly the prophecy of <a ref='Isaiah 53:9'>Is 53:9</a> . <a ref='Matthew 27:62'>27:62</a> <b>the next day.</b> The Sabbath. <b>the day after the Preparation.</b> This was on Friday. <a ref='Matthew 28:1'>28:1</a> <b>it began to dawn toward the first</b> day <b>of the week.</b> Sabbath officially ended with sundown on Saturday. At that time the women could purchase and prepare spices ( <a ref='Luke 24:1'>Lk 24:1</a> ). The event described here occurred the next morning, at dawn on Sunday, the first day of the week. <b>other Mary.</b> The mother of James the Less ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 27:56'>27:56</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 28:2'>28:2</a> <b>a great earthquake.</b> The second earthquake associated with Christ’s death ( <a ref='Matthew 27:51'>27:51</a> ). This one may have been confined to the immediate area around the grave, when “an angel” supernaturally “rolled away the stone”—not to let Jesus out, for if He could rise from the dead, He would need no help escaping an earthly tomb, but to let the women and the apostles in (v. <a ref='Matthew 28:6'>6</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 28:4'>28:4</a> <b>became like dead men.</b> This suggests that they were not merely paralyzed with fear, but completely unconscious, totally traumatized by what they had seen. The word translated “quaked” has the same root as the word for “earthquake” in v. <a ref='Matthew 28:2'>2</a> . The sudden appearance of this angel, at the same time the women arrived, was their first clue that anything extraordinary was happening. <a ref='Matthew 28:6'>28:6</a> <b>Come, see the place where He was lying.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 24:4'>Lk 24:4</a></i> for the order of these events as gleaned from all 4 Gospels. <a ref='Matthew 28:7'>28:7</a> <b>there you will see Him.</b> See vv. <a ref='Matthew 28:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Matthew 28:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 26:32'>26:32</a> ; <a ref='John 21:1–14'>Jn 21:1–14</a> . This does not mean they would not see Him until then. He was seen by the apostles several times before they saw Him in Galilee ( <a ref='Luke 24:15'>Lk 24:15</a> , <a ref='Luke 24:34'>34</a> , <a ref='Luke 24:36'>36</a> ; <a ref='John 20:19'>Jn 20:19</a> , <a ref='John 20:26'>26</a> ). But His supreme post-resurrection appearance was in Galilee, where “He appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time” ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:6'>1Co 15:6</a> ). <i>See note on v. <a ref='Matthew 28:16'>16</a> .</i> <a ref='Matthew 28:9'>28:9</a> <b>Jesus met them.</b> For a summary of Christ’s postresurrection appearances, <i>see note on <a ref='Luke 24:34'>Lk 24:34</a></i> . <a ref='Matthew 28:10'>28:10</a> <b>My brothers.</b> I.e., the disciples. <a ref='Matthew 28:11'>28:11</a> <b>reported to the chief priests.</b> The Jewish leaders’ determination to cover up what had occurred reveals the obstinacy of unbelief in the face of evidence ( <a ref='Luke 16:31'>Lk 16:31</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 28:12'>28:12</a> <b>a large sum of money.</b> Lit. “silver” (cf. <a ref='Matthew 26:15'>26:15</a> ). The bribery was necessary because the soldiers’ story, if true, could cost them their lives—since they were charged with guard duty under Pilate’s personal orders ( <a ref='Matthew 27:65'>27:65</a> ). The Jewish leaders also promised to cover for the soldiers if the false story they spread leaked back to Pilate (v. <a ref='Matthew 28:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 28:13'>28:13</a> <b>while we were asleep.</b> The story was obviously bogus, and not a very good cover-up. They could not possibly know what had happened while they were asleep. <a ref='Matthew 28:16'>28:16</a> <b>the eleven disciples.</b> This does not mean that only the 11 were present. The fact that some “doubted” (v. <a ref='Matthew 28:17'>17</a> ) strongly suggests that more than the 11 were present. It is likely that Christ arranged this meeting in Galilee because that was where most of His followers were. This seems the most likely location for the massive gathering of disciples Paul describes in <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:6'>1Co 15:6</a> ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Matthew 28:7'>7</a></i> ). <a ref='Matthew 28:17'>28:17</a> <b>but some doubted.</b> That simple phrase is one of countless testimonies to the integrity of Scripture. The transparent honesty of a statement like this shows that Matthew was not attempting to exclude or cover up facts that might lessen the perfection of such a glorious moment. <a ref='Matthew 28:18'>28:18</a> <b>All authority.</b> See <a ref='Matthew 11:27'>11:27</a> ; <a ref='John 3:35'>Jn 3:35</a> . Absolute sovereign authority—lordship over all—is handed to Christ, “in heaven and on earth.” This is clear proof of His deity. The time of His humiliation was at an end, and God had exalted Him above all ( <a ref='Philippians 2:9–11'>Php 2:9–11</a> ). <a ref='Matthew 28:19'>28:19</a> <b>therefore.</b> I.e., on the basis of His authority, the disciples were sent to “make disciples of all the nations.” The sweeping scope of their commission is consummate with His unlimited authority. <b>in the name of the Father … Son … Holy Spirit.</b> The formula is a strong affirmation of trinitarianism. <a ref='Matthew 28:20'>28:20</a> <b>teaching them to keep all that I commanded you.</b> The kind of evangelism called for in this commission does not end with the conversion of the unbeliever. <b>I am with you.</b> There’s a touching echo of the beginning of Matthew’s Gospel here. Immanuel, which is translated, “ God with us ” ( <a ref='Matthew 1:23'>1:23</a> ), remains “with” us “even to the end of the age”—i.e., until He returns bodily to judge the world and establish His earthly kingdom.",
