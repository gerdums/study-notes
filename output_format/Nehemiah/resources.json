    "content": "The Book of Nehemiah Title Nehemiah (“Jehovah comforts”) is a famous cupbearer, who never appears in Scripture outside of this book. As with the books of Ezra and Esther, named after his contemporaries (see Introductions to Ezra and Esther ), the book recounts selected events of his leadership and was titled after him. Both the Greek Septuagint (LXX) and the Latin Vulgate named this book “Second Ezra.” Even though the two books of Ezra and Nehemiah are separate in most English Bibles, they may have once been joined together in a single unit as currently in the Hebrew texts. New Testament writers do not quote Nehemiah. Author and Date Though much of this book was clearly drawn from Nehemiah’s personal diaries and written from his first person perspective ( <a ref='Nehemiah 1:1–7:5'>1:1—7:5</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 12:27–43'>12:27–43</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 13:4–31'>13:4–31</a> ), both Jewish and Christian traditions recognize Ezra as the author. This is based on external evidence that Ezra and Nehemiah were originally one book as reflected in the LXX and Vulgate; it is also based on internal evidence such as the recurrent “hand of Yahweh” theme which dominates both Ezra and Nehemiah and the author’s role as a priest-scribe. As a scribe, he had access to the royal archives of Persia, which accounts for the myriad of administrative documents found recorded in the two books, especially in the book of Ezra. Very few people would have been allowed access to the royal archives of the Persian Empire, but Ezra proved to be the exception (cf. <a ref='Ezra 1:2–4'>Ezr 1:2–4</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 4:9–22'>4:9–22</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 5:7–17'>5:7–17</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 6:3–12'>6:3–12</a> ). The events in <a ref='Ne 1'>Nehemiah 1</a> commence late in the year 446 BC, the 20th year of the Persian king, Artaxerxes (464–423 BC). The book follows chronologically from Nehemiah’s first term as governor of Jerusalem ca. 445–433 BC ( <a ref='Ne 1-12'>Ne 1–12</a> ) to his second term, possibly beginning ca. 424 BC ( <a ref='Ne 13'>Ne 13</a> ). Nehemiah was written by Ezra sometime during or after Nehemiah’s second term, but no later than 400 BC. Background and Setting True to God’s promise of judgment, He brought the Assyrians and Babylonians to deliver His chastisement upon wayward Judah and Israel. In 722 BC the Assyrians deported the 10 northern tribes and scattered them all over the then known world ( <a ref='2Ki 17'>2Ki 17</a> ). Several centuries later, ca. 605–586 BC, God used the Babylonians to sack, destroy, and nearly depopulate Jerusalem ( <a ref='2Ki 25'>2Ki 25</a> ) because Judah had persisted in her unfaithfulness to the covenant. God chastened His people with 70 years of captivity in Babylon ( <a ref='Jeremiah 25:11'>Jer 25:11</a> ). During the Jews’ captivity, world empire leadership changed hands from the Babylonians to the Persians (ca. 539 BC; <a ref='Da 5'>Da 5</a> ), after which Daniel received most of his prophetic revelation (cf. <a ref='Da 6'>Da 6</a> , <a ref='Da 9-12'>9–12</a> ). The book of Ezra begins with the decree of Cyrus, a Persian king, to return God’s people to Jerusalem to rebuild God’s house (ca. 539 BC), and chronicles the reestablishment of Judah’s national calendar of feasts and sacrifices. Zerubbabel and Joshua led the first return ( <a ref='Ezr 1-6'>Ezr 1–6</a> ) and rebuilt the temple. Esther gives a glimpse of the Jews left in Persia (ca. 483–473 BC) when Haman attempted to eliminate the Jewish race. <a ref='Ezr 7-10'>Ezra 7–10</a> recounts the second return led by Ezra in 458 BC. Nehemiah chronicles the third return to rebuild the wall around Jerusalem (ca. 445 BC). At that time in Judah’s history, the Persian Empire dominated the entire Near Eastern world. Its administration of Judah, although done with a loose hand, was mindful of disruptions or any signs of rebellion from its vassals. Rebuilding the walls of conquered cities posed the most glaring threat to the Persian central administration. Only a close confidant of the king himself could be trusted for such an operation. At the most critical juncture in Judah’s revitalization, God raised up Nehemiah to exercise one of the most trusted roles in the empire, the King’s cupbearer and confidant. Life under the Persian king Artaxerxes (ca. 464–423 BC) had its advantages for Nehemiah. Much like Joseph, Esther, and Daniel, he had attained a significant role in the palace which then ruled the ancient world, a position from which God could use him to lead the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls in spite of its implications for Persian control of that city. Several other historical notes are of interest. First, Esther was Artaxerxes’ stepmother ( <i>see note on <a ref='Es 1:9'>Es 1:9</a></i> ) and could have easily influenced him to look favorably upon the Jews, especially Nehemiah. Second, Daniel’s prophetic 70 weeks began with the decree to rebuild the city issued by Artaxerxes in 445 BC (cf. chaps. <a ref='Ne 1-2'>1–2</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Daniel 9:24–26'>Da 9:24–26</a></i> ). Third, the Elephantine papyri (Egyptian documents), dated to the late 5th century BC, support the account of Nehemiah by mentioning Sanballat the governor of Samaria ( <a ref='Nehemiah 2:19'>2:19</a> ), Jehohanan ( <a ref='Nehemiah 6:18'>6:18</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 12:23'>12:23</a> ), and Nehemiah’s being replaced as governor of Jerusalem by Bigvai (ca. 410 BC; <a ref='Nehemiah 10:16'>Ne 10:16</a> ). Finally, Nehemiah and Malachi represent the last of the OT canonical writings, both in terms of the time the events occurred (chap. <a ref='Ne 13'>13</a> ; <a ref='Mal 1-4'>Mal 1–4</a> ) and the time when they were recorded by Ezra. Thus the next messages from God for Israel do not come until over 400 years of silence had passed, after which the births of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ were announced ( <a ref='Mt 1'>Mt 1</a> ; <a ref='Lu 1-2'>Lk 1–2</a> ). With the full OT revelation of Israel’s history prior to Christ’s incarnation being completed, the Jews had not yet experienced the fullness of God’s various covenants and promises to them. While there was a Jewish remnant, as promised to Abraham (cf. <a ref='Genesis 15:5'>Ge 15:5</a> ), it does not appear to be even as large as at the time of the Exodus ( <a ref='Numbers 1:46'>Nu 1:46</a> ). The Jews neither possessed the Land ( <a ref='Genesis 15:7'>Ge 15:7</a> ) nor did they rule as a sovereign nation ( <a ref='Genesis 12:2'>Ge 12:2</a> ). The Davidic throne was unoccupied (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 7:16'>2Sa 7:16</a> ), although the High Priest was of the line of Eleazar and Phinehas (cf. <a ref='Numbers 25:10–13'>Nu 25:10–13</a> ). God’s promise to consummate the New Covenant of redemption awaited the birth, crucifixion, and resurrection of Messiah (cf. <a ref='Heb 7-10'>Heb 7–10</a> ). Historical and Theological Themes Careful attention to the reading of God’s Word in order to perform His will is a constant theme. The spiritual revival came in response to Ezra’s reading of “the book of the law of Moses” ( <a ref='Nehemiah 8:1'>8:1</a> ). After the reading, Ezra and some of the priests carefully explained its meaning to the people in attendance ( <a ref='Nehemiah 8:8'>8:8</a> ). The next day, Ezra met with some of the fathers of the households, the priests, and Levites, in order to “gain insight into the words of the law” ( <a ref='Nehemiah 8:13'>8:13</a> ). The sacrificial system was carried on with careful attention to perform it “as it is written in the law” ( <a ref='Nehemiah 10:34'>10:34</a> , <a ref='Nehemiah 10:36'>36</a> ). So deep was their concern to abide by God’s revealed will that they took “a curse and an oath to walk in God’s law.…” ( <a ref='Nehemiah 10:29'>10:29</a> ). When the marriage reforms were carried out, they acted in accordance with that which “they read from the book of Moses” ( <a ref='Nehemiah 13:1'>13:1</a> ). A second major theme, the obedience of Nehemiah, is explicitly referred to throughout the book due to the fact that the book is based on the memoirs or first-person accounts of Nehemiah. God worked through the obedience of Nehemiah; however, He also worked through the wrongly motivated, wicked hearts of His enemies. Nehemiah’s enemies failed, not so much as a result of the success of Nehemiah’s strategies, but because “God had thwarted their counsel” ( <a ref='Nehemiah 4:15'>4:15</a> ). God used the opposition of Judah’s enemies to drive His people to their knees in the same way that He used the favor of Cyrus to return His people to the land, to fund their building project, and to even protect the reconstruction of Jerusalem’s walls. Not surprisingly, Nehemiah acknowledged the true motive of his strategy to repopulate Jerusalem: “my God put it into my heart” ( <a ref='Nehemiah 7:5'>7:5</a> ). It was He who accomplished it. Another theme in Nehemiah, as in Ezra, is opposition. Judah’s enemies started rumors that God’s people had revolted against Persia. The goal was to intimidate Judah into forestalling reconstruction of the walls. In spite of opposition from without and heartbreaking corruption and dissension from within, Judah completed the walls of Jerusalem in only 52 days ( <a ref='Nehemiah 6:15'>6:15</a> ), experienced revival after the reading of the law by Ezra ( <a ref='Ezra 8:1'>8:1ff.</a> ), and celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles ( <a ref='Ezra 8:14'>8:14ff.</a> ; ca. 445 BC). The book’s detailed insight into the personal thoughts, motives, and disappointments of Nehemiah makes it easy for the reader to primarily identify with him rather than “the sovereign hand of God” theme and the primary message of His control and intervention into the affairs of His people and their enemies. But the exemplary behavior of the famous cupbearer is eclipsed by God who orchestrated the reconstruction of the walls in spite of much opposition and many setbacks; the “good hand of God” theme carries through the book of Nehemiah ( <a ref='Nehemiah 1:10'>1:10</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 2:8'>2:8</a> , <a ref='Nehemiah 2:18'>18</a> ). Interpretive Challenges The reader must recognize that the time line of chapters <a ref='Ne 1-12'>1–12</a> encompassed about one year (445 BC), followed by a long gap of time (over 20 years) after <a ref='Ne 12'>Ne 12</a> and before <a ref='Ne 13'>Ne 13</a> ( <i>see “Time Line of Nehemiah”</i> ). Also, it must be recognized that Nehemiah actually served two governorships in Jerusalem, the first from 445–433 BC (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 5:14'>Ne 5:14</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 13:6'>13:6</a> ) and the second beginning possibly in 424 BC and extending to no longer than 410 BC.

The promise appeared to be failing, and Nehemiah appealed to God’s character and covenant as the basis by which He must intervene and accomplish His pledges to His people. <a ref='Nehemiah 1:6'>1:6</a> <b>we have sinned against You.</b> Nehemiah may have believed that the sins of the returnees (cf. <a ref='Ezr 9-10'>Ezr 9–10</a> ) had prompted God to change His mind and withhold His favor from the Jews. <a ref='Nehemiah 1:7'>1:7</a> <b>commandments … statutes … judgments.</b> Those which are recorded in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. <a ref='Nehemiah 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>Remember.</b> Not a reminder to God as if He had forgotten, but a plea to activate His Word. <a ref='Nehemiah 1:8–9'>1:8–9</a> <b>the word … Moses.</b> This represents a summary of various Mosaic writings. On “scatter” (v. <a ref='Nehemiah 1:8'>8</a> ) see <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:25–28'>Dt 4:25–28</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:63–65'>28:63–65</a> . On “gather” see <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:29–31'>Dt 4:29–31</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:1–5'>30:1–5</a> . <a ref='Nehemiah 1:10'>1:10</a> <b>redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand.</b> His allusion to the Exodus redemption recalled the faithful and strong hand of God which had brought Israel out of bondage once before and grounded his confidence in God’s power as the basis of his appeal for a second deliverance that will be as successful as the first. <a ref='Nehemiah 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>who delight to fear Your name.</b> Nehemiah alluded to the fact that Israel was the place which God had chosen for His name to dwell ( <a ref='Nehemiah 1:9'>1:9</a> ); the people desired to fear His name and, thus, were praying for God’s intervention. <b>before this man.</b> The reference to King Artaxerxes anticipated the discussion in <a ref='Nehemiah 2:1'>2:1ff.</a> <b>cupbearer to the king.</b> As an escort of the monarch at meals, the cupbearer had a unique advantage to petition the king. Not only did the king owe him his life, since the cupbearer tested all the king’s beverages for possible poison, thus putting his own life at risk, but he also became a close confidant. God sovereignly used this relationship between a Gentile and Jew to deliver His people, such as He did with Joseph, Daniel, Esther, and Mordecai. <a ref='Nehemiah 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>Nisan.</b> Mar./Apr. 445 BC. <b>twentieth year.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Nehemiah 1:1'>1:1</a> .</i> <b>that wine</b> was <b>before him.</b> Since the act of tasting wine to ensure it was not dangerous to the king strengthened the trust between king and cupbearer, this was the appropriate time for Nehemiah to win Artaxerxes’ attention and approval. Not surprisingly, kings often developed so much trust in their cupbearers that the latter became counselors to the kings. <b>Now I had not been sad.</b> Sadness was a dangerous emotion to express in the king’s presence. The king wanted his subjects to be happy, since this reflected the well-being brought about by his administrative prowess. <a ref='Nehemiah 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>very much afraid.</b> He feared that either his countenance, his explanation, or his request would anger the king and thus lead to his death (cf. <a ref='Es 4:11'>Es 4:11</a> with <a ref='Es 5:1–3'>5:1–3</a> ). <a ref='Nehemiah 2:3'>2:3</a> <b>tombs … gates.</b> Nehemiah’s deep concern and sadness over the condition of Jerusalem and his people was expressed in his reference to tombs and gates. A tomb was a place to show respect for dead community members who birthed the living generation and passed on their spiritual values to them. Tombs were also the place where the present generation hoped to be honored by burial at death. Gates were emblematic of the life of the city, since the people gathered for judicial procedure or basic social interaction near the gates. The burned gates represented the death of social life, i.e., the end of a community of people. <a ref='Nehemiah 2:4'>2:4</a> <b>What would you request?</b> The king rightly interpreted Nehemiah’s sad countenance as a desire to take action on behalf of his people and homeland. His immediate response to the king’s question illustrates how continual his prayer life was (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 1:6'>1:6</a> ). <b>God of heaven.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Ezra 1:2'>Ezr 1:2</a> .</i> <a ref='Nehemiah 2:5'>2:5</a> <b>that I may rebuild it.</b> The request undeniably referred to the city walls, for there could be no permanence without walls, but it also may have included political and administrative rebuilding as well. <a ref='Nehemiah 2:6'>2:6</a> <b>the queen.</b> Since Esther was the queen of the previous king Ahasuerus (Xerxes) ca. 486–464 BC and the stepmother of Artaxerxes, it could be that she had previously influenced the present king and queen to be favorably disposed to the Jews. <b>return.</b> This presupposes that Nehemiah was being dispatched on his desired mission and upon its completion would return to Persia (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 13:6'>Ne 13:6</a> ). <a ref='Nehemiah 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>let letters be given me.</b> Official letters transferred a portion of the king’s authority to Nehemiah. In this context, he needed to pass through the lands of Judah’s enemies who could harm him or prevent him from rebuilding Jerusalem. The roads upon which messengers, ambassadors, and envoys of all sorts traveled had stations where such letters could be inspected for passage. Three months of travel from Susa to Jerusalem was long, dangerous, and ridden with protocol where letters were required for passage. The danger associated with the passage, but particularly the administrative authority which Nehemiah carried in the letters, led Artaxerxes to send captains of the army and horsemen with Nehemiah for protection ( <a ref='Nehemiah 2:9'>2:9</a> ). <i>See notes on <a ref='Ezra 1:11'>Ezr 1:11</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 7:8–9'>7:8–9</a> .</i> <a ref='Nehemiah 2:8'>2:8</a> <b>and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest.</b> Lumber was a very precious commodity. This is illustrated in a document from one ancient city in Mesopotamia in which a forest official is taken to court for cutting down a tree. Forests were carefully guarded, and written permission from the king would assure Nehemiah of the lumber he would need to build the citadel, wall reinforcements, and his own residence from which he would administrate the reconstruction. <b>fortress.</b> This edifice located next to the temple on the northwest side was a fortified building for the purpose of guarding the temple. It was subsequently rebuilt by Herod and named Antonia. <b>the good hand of my God</b> was <b>on me.</b> This refrain is common to both Ezra and Nehemiah. It is a frequent reminder in these inspired books that God works through His servants to accomplish His will (cf. <a ref='Ezra 1:5'>Ezr 1:5</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 7:6'>7:6</a> ). <a ref='Nehemiah 2:9–3:1'>2:9—3:1</a> The journey from Persia to Jerusalem and the preparation period was to be 3–4 months (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 2:1'>2:1</a> with <a ref='Nehemiah 6:15'>6:15</a> ). <a ref='Nehemiah 2:9'>2:9</a> <b>I came to the governors.</b> Nehemiah’s encroachment upon their provincial control posed a tremendous threat to these officials. If handled improperly, disregard for the other local officials would have put Nehemiah’s life and the lives of those in Jerusalem in jeopardy. To prevent such a reaction, God had moved the Persian king to dispatch royal army captains and horsemen to accompany Nehemiah and to guard against such attacks. <a ref='Nehemiah 2:10'>2:10</a> <b>Sanballat … Tobiah.</b> These men were probably also behind the opposition described in <a ref='Ezra 4:7–23'>Ezr 4:7–23</a> which stopped the work in Jerusalem. Sanballat served as governor of Samaria (Horonaim being a town in Moab, he was probably a Moabite) and Tobiah of the region east of the Jordan. These district magistrates were leaders of Samaritan factions (see chap. <a ref='Ne 6'>6</a> ) to the north and east. They had lost any recourse to prevent Judah from rebuilding since God’s people were authorized to fortify their settlement against attack from enemies such as these two officials.

Nehemiah and the others had received word that Sanballat had mustered the army of Samaria ( <a ref='Nehemiah 4:2'>4:2</a> ). In fact, God made sure the strategy was known by letting the nearby Jews know, so they would report it to Judah’s leaders. Though vigilant, armed, and ready, Nehemiah and those he led consistently gave God the glory for their victories and construction successes. <a ref='Nehemiah 4:16–18'>4:16–18a</a> The threats cut the work force in half, and even those who worked carried weapons in case of attack (cf. v. <a ref='Nehemiah 4:21'>21</a> ). <a ref='Nehemiah 4:18–20'>4:18b–20</a> <b>trumpet.</b> Among other functions, trumpets were used to sound an alarm in the event of danger or to summon soldiers to battle. Nehemiah kept a trumpeter at his side always, so that the alarm could be sounded immediately. His plan also included perpetual diligence (vv. <a ref='Nehemiah 4:22–23'>22–23</a> ). <a ref='Nehemiah 5:1–13'>5:1–13</a> Enemy opposition and difficult times in general had precipitated economic conditions which had a devastating effect on Judah’s fragile life. The effect of this extortion on the morale of the returnees was worse than the enemy opposition. <a ref='Nehemiah 5:1–5'>5:1–5</a> <b>Jewish brothers.</b> Perhaps this refers again to the nobles who would not work and had alliances with the enemies ( <i>see note on <a ref='Nehemiah 3:5'>3:5</a></i> ). The people were fatigued with hard labor, drained by the relentless harassment of enemies, poor and lacking the necessities of life, lacking tax money and borrowing for it, and working on the wall in the city rather than getting food from the country. On top of this came complaints against the terrible exploitation and extortion by the rich Jews who would not help, but forced people to sell their homes and children, while having no ability to redeem them back. Under normal conditions, the law offered the hope of releasing these young people through the remission of debts which occurred every 7 years or in the 50th year of Jubilee ( <a ref='Le 25'>Lv 25</a> ). The custom of redemption made it possible to “redeem” the enslaved individual at almost any time, but the desperate financial situation of those times made that appear impossible. <a ref='Nehemiah 5:7'>5:7</a> <b>I … contended with the nobles and the officials.</b> The commitment of the nobles and officials to the reconstruction project was negligible (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 3:5'>3:5</a> ), while their loyalty to Tobiah and others in opposition added to their opportunistic attitudes, placing them close to the status of opposition. They had become the enemy from within. <b>exacting usury.</b> Usury can refer to normal interest, or it can signify excessive interest. According to Mosaic law, the Jews were forbidden to take interest from their brothers on the loan of money, food, or anything else. If the person was destitute, they should consider it a gift. If they could pay it back later, it was to be without interest (see <a ref='Leviticus 25:36–37'>Lv 25:36–37</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:19–20'>Dt 23:19–20</a> ). Such generosity marked the godly (see <a ref='Psalms 15:5'>Ps 15:5</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 15:10'>Jer 15:10</a> ; cf. <a ref='Proverbs 28:8'>Pr 28:8</a> ). Interest could be taken from foreigners ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:20'>Dt 23:20</a> ). Interest loans were known to exceed 50 percent at times in ancient nations. Such usury took advantage of people’s desperation and was virtually impossible to repay, consuming their entire family assets and reducing the debtors to permanent slavery. <i>See notes on <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:19–20'>Dt 23:19–20</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:10–13'>24:10–13</a> .</i> <a ref='Nehemiah 5:8'>5:8</a> <b>We … have bought</b> back <b>.</b> Nehemiah denounced with just severity the evil conduct of selling a brother by means of usury. He contrasted it with his own action of buying back with his own money some of the Jewish exiles, who through debt had lost their freedom in Babylon. <a ref='Nehemiah 5:10'>5:10</a> <b>likewise I.</b> Nehemiah set the example again by making loans, but not in exacting usury. <a ref='Nehemiah 5:11'>5:11</a> <b>give back to them.</b> To remedy the evil that they had brought, those guilty of usury were to return the property they had confiscated from those who couldn’t pay the loans back, as well as returning the interest they had charged ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Luke 19:2–10'>Lk 19:2–10</a></i> ). <a ref='Nehemiah 5:12'>5:12</a> <b>swear.</b> The consciences of the guilty were struck by Nehemiah’s words, so that their fear, shame, and contrition caused them to pledge the release of their loans and restore property and interest, including setting slaves free. This cancellation of debt had a profoundly unifying effect on both sides of the indebtedness. The proceedings were formally consummated with the people binding themselves by a solemn oath from the priests (with them as administrators) that they would be faithful to the pledge. <a ref='Nehemiah 5:13'>5:13</a> <b>shook out the front.</b> This curse rite from the governor, Nehemiah, called down God’s wrath upon anyone who would not follow through with his commitment to release debts.

Verses <a ref='Nehemiah 5:17–18'>17–18</a> record that he supported 150 men with abundant provisions who ruled with him (and their families), indicating the personal wealth he had brought from Babylon. <a ref='Nehemiah 5:15'>5:15</a> <b>forty shekels.</b> Approximately one lb. of silver. <b>because of the fear of God.</b> Nehemiah would not exact usury from his fellow countrymen as his predecessors had, because he viewed it as an act of disobedience toward God. <a ref='Nehemiah 5:16'>5:16</a> <b>we did not buy any land.</b> Even though the time to purchase property from those forced to sell couldn’t have been better, Nehemiah maintained a consistent personal policy not to take advantage of another’s distress.

An open or unsealed letter was not only a sign of disrespect and open criticism, but also suggested the information therein was public knowledge. The goal of this document was to intimidate Nehemiah into stopping the work. <a ref='Nehemiah 6:6'>6:6</a> <b>It is heard among the nations.</b> The letter suggested that Nehemiah’s intent to revolt was common knowledge which would get back to the king of Persia if he didn’t come to the requested conference. <b>you and the Jews are planning to rebel.</b> This information would have brought Persian troops against the Jews had it been true. Even though Judah had a reputation for breaking its allegiances with its overlord kings, on this occasion that was not the case. <b>rebuilding the wall … be their king.</b> Artaxerxes had commissioned the rebuilding of the wall based on his relationship of trust with Nehemiah. Once the project was accomplished, the king expected Nehemiah to return to Susa. Allegations that Nehemiah was fortifying the city so that he might be made king would seriously violate the Persian king’s trust, if not create a war. The plot was an attempt to intimidate Nehemiah with the idea that a wedge was to be driven between Nehemiah and Artaxerxes so that Nehemiah would come to the meeting with those enemies—a meeting that would have featured his death. <a ref='Nehemiah 6:7'>6:7</a> <b>set up prophets to call out.</b> If there were such prophets, Sanballat actually hired them to feed incorrect information generating the false rumor (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 6:10–14'>6:10–14</a> ). By dispatching such prophets to make public proclamations that Nehemiah had made himself king, the Persian imperial rule would have appeared to be supplanted. <a ref='Nehemiah 6:10'>6:10</a> <b>Shemaiah.</b> When the open letter failed to intimidate Nehemiah into stopping the work and coming to a meeting, his enemies decided to try intimidation from within. They hired a false prophet (v. <a ref='Nehemiah 6:12'>12</a> ), Shemaiah, to lure Nehemiah into the Holy Place in the temple for refuge from a murder plot. To enter and shut himself in the Holy Place would have been a desecration of the house of God and would have caused people to question his reverence for God. Shemaiah was the son of a priest who was an intimate friend of Nehemiah. This plan would give them grounds to raise an evil report against Nehemiah, who was not a priest and had no right to go into the Holy Place (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 6:13'>6:13</a> ). It could also make the people question his courage (v. <a ref='Nehemiah 6:11'>11</a> ). Other disloyal Jews included: 1) the nobles ( <a ref='Nehemiah 3:5'>3:5</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 6:17'>6:17</a> ); 2) Jews who lived near Sanballat ( <a ref='Nehemiah 4:12'>4:12</a> ); 3) Noadiah ( <a ref='Nehemiah 6:14'>6:14</a> ); 4) Meshullam ( <a ref='Nehemiah 6:17–19'>6:17–19</a> ); 5) Eliashib ( <a ref='Nehemiah 13:4'>13:4</a> , <a ref='Nehemiah 13:7'>7</a> ); and 6) the High Priest’s grandson ( <a ref='Nehemiah 13:28'>13:28</a> ). <b>the house of God.</b> This is a frequently used name for the temple (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 8:16'>8:16</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 10:32–39'>10:32–39</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 11:11'>11:11</a> , <a ref='Nehemiah 11:16'>16</a> , <a ref='Nehemiah 11:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 12:40'>12:40</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 13:4'>13:4</a> , <a ref='Nehemiah 13:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Nehemiah 13:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Nehemiah 13:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Nehemiah 13:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Nehemiah 6:15'>6:15</a> <b>Elul.</b> Aug./Sept., 445 BC.

Shemaiah was from the family of Arah ( <a ref='Ezra 2:5'>Ezr 2:5</a> ); his son Jehohanan was the son-in-law of Meshullam who shared in the work of building ( <a ref='Nehemiah 3:4'>3:4</a> , <a ref='Nehemiah 3:30'>30</a> ). According to <a ref='Nehemiah 13:4'>13:4</a> , the High Priest, Eliashib, was related to Tobiah (which is a Jewish name). The meddling of these nobles, by trying to play both sides through reports to Tobiah and to Nehemiah (v. <a ref='Nehemiah 6:19'>19</a> ), only widened the breach as Tobiah escalated efforts to frighten the governor. <a ref='Nehemiah 7:2'>7:2</a> <b>Hanani.</b> Cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 1:2'>1:2</a> . <b>the fortress.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Nehemiah 2:8'>2:8</a> .</i> <a ref='Nehemiah 7:3'>7:3</a> In the ancient Near East, it was customary to open the city gates at sunrise and close them at sunset. Nehemiah recommended that this not be done, because of the hostility of the enemies. Rather the gates were to be kept shut until well into the heat of the morning when everyone was up and active.

Many had escaped the required action of divorce and kept their pagan wives. Perhaps new defaulters had appeared also, and were confronted for the first time with this necessary action of divorce. Nehemiah’s efforts were successful in removing this evil mixture. <a ref='Nehemiah 9:3'>9:3</a> <b>they rose up … read … confessing and worshipping.</b> The succession of events helped to reestablish the essential commitment of Israel to God and His law.

In response to all of this, they worshiped. <a ref='Nehemiah 9:4–37'>9:4–37</a> This long confession of sin in the context of the recitation of God’s mighty redemptive acts on Israel’s behalf is an expression of worship (v. <a ref='Nehemiah 9:3'>3</a> ) that recalls some of the psalms in their theme and worshipful purpose. This season of national humiliation centered on adoring God for His great mercy in the forgiveness of their multiplied iniquities, in delivering them from judgment, protecting them, and blessing them graciously. Apparently, this great prayer of worship offered to God was recited by a group of Levites (vv. <a ref='Nehemiah 9:4–5'>4–5</a> ) indicating it had been prepared and adopted beforehand, probably by Ezra. This prayer initiated the 3 hours of confession and worship (v. <a ref='Nehemiah 9:3'>3</a> ), which led to a national promise of obedience to God in the future (v. <a ref='Nehemiah 9:38'>38</a> ). <a ref='Nehemiah 9:6'>9:6</a> <b>have made the heavens.</b> The recitation was ordered historically, although themes of promise and judgment are traced through Israel’s history with God.

Though well intended, as they had been in <a ref='Exodus 24:1–8'>Ex 24:1–8</a> , their failure was forthcoming ( <i>see note on <a ref='Nehemiah 13:10–13'>13:10–13</a></i> ). <a ref='Nehemiah 9:38'>9:38</a> <b>because of all this.</b> The history of God’s faithfulness, in spite of Israel’s unfaithfulness, is the ground of a pledge and promise which the people make to obey God and not repeat the sins of their fathers. <b>We are cutting an agreement in writing.</b> An agreement, or covenant, was a binding contract between two parties. In short, it was a formalized relationship with commitments to loyalty. In this case, the nation initiated this covenant with God. <a ref='Nehemiah 10:1–27'>10:1–27</a> The list of sealed signatures on the covenant were from the leaders.

Intermarriage with the nations had previously precipitated an influence in Israel which had culminated in Babylonian slavery, thus playing a major role in Israel’s unfaithfulness to the covenant. <a ref='Nehemiah 10:29'>10:29</a> <b>a curse and an oath.</b> Covenants characteristically were ratified by an oath ceremony in which the parties swore to the terms of the covenant. A curse rite was often included wherein the slaughtering of an animal indicated similar consequences for the covenant breaker. Israel’s pledged adherence to the law was thus solemnly affirmed. <a ref='Nehemiah 10:30'>10:30</a> <b>not give our daughters … or take their daughters.</b> Parents controlled marriages, so this part of the covenant came from them.

The Mosaic ordinance required one-half of a shekel (see <a ref='Exodus 30:11–16'>Ex 30:11–16</a> ), but the severe economic straits of the time led to the reduced amount. By the time of Christ, the people had returned to the Mosaic stipulation of one-half of a shekel. <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 17:24'>Mt 17:24</a> .</i> <a ref='Nehemiah 10:34'>10:34</a> The carrying of the wood for the constantly burning altar ( <a ref='Leviticus 6:12'>Lv 6:12</a> ff.) had formerly been the duty of the temple servants, but few of them had returned from Babylon ( <a ref='Nehemiah 7:60'>7:60</a> ) so more people were chosen to assist in this task. <a ref='Nehemiah 10:35–39'>10:35–39</a> Laws for all the offerings and tithes were reinstated so as not to “forsake the house of our God” (v. <a ref='Nehemiah 10:39'>39</a> ). <a ref='Nehemiah 10:35–37'>10:35–37</a> <b>first fruits … firstborn … firstborn.</b> These laws required the first fruits of the ground (see <a ref='Exodus 23:19'>Ex 23:19</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 34:26'>34:26</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:2'>Dt 26:2</a> ), the first fruits of the trees (see <a ref='Leviticus 19:24'>Lv 19:24</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 18:13'>Nu 18:13</a> ), the firstborn sons redeemed by the estimated price of the priest (see <a ref='Numbers 18:15'>Nu 18:15</a> ), and the firstborn of the herds and flocks (see <a ref='Exodus 13:12'>Ex 13:12</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 18:15'>Nu 18:15</a> , <a ref='Numbers 18:17'>17</a> ). All of this was kept at the storehouses near the temple and distributed for the support of the priests and Levites. The Levites then gave a tenth of what they received to the priests (cf. <a ref='Numbers 18:26'>Nu 18:26</a> ). <a ref='Nehemiah 11:1–13:31'>11:1—13:31</a> Details of Nehemiah exercising his governorship are given in this section. <a ref='Nehemiah 11:1–12:26'>11:1—12:26</a> Jerusalem and Judah are resettled. <a ref='Nehemiah 11:1'>11:1</a> <b>cast lots.</b> A method of decision-making which God honored ( <a ref='Proverbs 16:33'>Pr 16:33</a> ).

Perhaps two are omitted because their families had become extinct, because no sons were born since the time Zerubbabel originally named them. This then is a selective rather than exhaustive listing of priests and Levites from the time of Zerubbabel and Jeshua, recording the key priests and Levites through 3 generations of High Priests: 1) Jeshua who came in the initial return with Zerubbabel ca. 538 BC (vv. <a ref='Nehemiah 12:1–11'>1–11</a> ); 2) Joiakim, the son of Jeshua (vv. <a ref='Nehemiah 12:12–21'>12–21</a> ); 3) Eliashib (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 3:1'>3:1</a> ) the son of Joiakim (vv. <a ref='Nehemiah 12:22–23'>22–23</a> ); 4) a miscellaneous group who served in the days of Joiakim (vv. <a ref='Nehemiah 12:24–26'>24–26</a> ). <a ref='Nehemiah 12:1'>12:1</a> <b>Zerubbabel … Jeshua.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Ezra 2:2'>Ezr 2:2</a> .</i> <a ref='Nehemiah 12:10–11'>12:10–11</a> This record lists 6 generations of High Priests beginning with Jeshua.

During his absence, the people returned to their former ways, led by the High Priest Eliashib (vv. <a ref='Nehemiah 13:4–5'>4–5</a> ). Such a defection called for the needed reforms of vv. <a ref='Nehemiah 13:1–3'>1–3</a> , <a ref='Nehemiah 13:10–30'>10–30</a> . It was during Nehemiah’s absence that Malachi also wrote his prophetic book indicting both priests and people for their sinful defection.
