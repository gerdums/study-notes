    "content": "The Book of Zephaniah Title As with each of the 12 Minor Prophets, the prophecy bears the name of its author, which is generally thought to mean “the Lord hides” (cf. <a ref='Zephaniah 2:3'>2:3</a> ). Author and Date Little is known about the author, Zephaniah. Three other OT individuals share his name. He traces his genealogy back 4 generations to King Hezekiah (ca. 715–686 BC), standing alone among the prophets descended from royal blood ( <a ref='Zephaniah 1:1'>1:1</a> ). Royal genealogy would have given him the ear of Judah’s king, Josiah, during whose reign he preached. The prophet himself dates his message during the reign of Josiah (640–609 BC). The moral and spiritual conditions detailed in the book (cf. <a ref='Zephaniah 1:4–6'>1:4–6</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 3:1–7'>3:1–7</a> ) seem to place the prophecy prior to Josiah’s reforms, when Judah was still languishing in idolatry and wickedness. It was in 628 BC that Josiah tore down all the altars to Baal, burned the bones of false prophets, and broke the carved idols ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 34:3–7'>2Chr 34:3–7</a> ); and in 622 BC the Book of the Law was found ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 34:8–35:19'>2Chr 34:8—35:19</a> ). Consequently, Zephaniah most likely prophesied from 635–625 BC, and was a contemporary of Jeremiah. Background and Setting Politically, the imminent transfer of Assyrian world power to the Babylonians weakened Nineveh’s hold on Judah, bringing an element of independence to Judah for the first time in 50 years. King Josiah’s desire to retain this newfound freedom from taxation and subservience undoubtedly led him to interfere later with Egypt’s attempt to interdict the fleeing king of Nineveh in 609 BC (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:20–27'>2Chr 35:20–27</a> ). Spiritually, the reigns of Hezekiah’s son Manasseh (ca. 695–642 BC), extending over 4 decades, and his grandson Amon (ca. 642–640 BC), lasting only two years, were marked by wickedness and apostasy ( <a ref='2Ki 21'>2Ki 21</a> ; <a ref='2Ch 33'>2Chr 33</a> ). The early years of Josiah’s reign were also characterized by the evil from his father ( <a ref='2 Kings 23:4'>2Ki 23:4</a> ). In 622 BC, however, while repairing the house of the Lord, Hilkiah the High Priest found the Book of the Law ( <a ref='2 Kings 22:8'>2Ki 22:8</a> ). Upon reading it, Josiah initiated extensive reforms ( <a ref='2Ki 23'>2Ki 23</a> ). It was during the early years of Josiah’s reign, prior to the great revival, that this 11th hour prophet, Zephaniah, prophesied and no doubt had an influence on the sweeping reforms Josiah brought to the nation. But the evil kings before Josiah (55 years) had had such an effect on Judah that it never recovered. Josiah’s reforms were too late and didn’t outlast his life. Historical and Theological Themes Zephaniah’s message on the Day of Yahweh warned Judah that the final days were near, through divine judgment at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, ca. 605–586 BC ( <a ref='Zephaniah 1:4–13'>1:4–13</a> ). Yet, it also looks beyond to the far fulfillment in the judgments of Daniel’s 70th week ( <a ref='Zephaniah 1:18'>1:18</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 3:8'>3:8</a> ). The expression “Day of Yahweh” is described as a day that is near ( <a ref='Zephaniah 1:7'>1:7</a> ), and as a day of wrath, trouble, distress, devastation, desolation, darkness, gloominess, clouds, thick darkness, trumpet, and alarm ( <a ref='Zephaniah 1:15–16'>1:15–16</a> , <a ref='Zephaniah 1:18'>18</a> ). Yet even within these oracles of divine wrath, the prophet exhorted the people to seek the Lord, offering a shelter in the midst of judgment ( <a ref='Zephaniah 2:3'>2:3</a> ), and proclaiming the promise of eventual salvation for His believing remnant ( <a ref='Zephaniah 2:7'>2:7</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 3:9–20'>3:9–20</a> ). Interpretive Challenges The book presents an unambiguous denunciation of sin and warning of imminent judgment on Judah. Some have referred the phrase “I will change <i>them</i> to peoples with purified lips” ( <a ref='Zephaniah 3:9'>3:9</a> ) to the restoration of a universal language, similar to the days prior to confusion of languages at the Tower of Babel ( <a ref='Genesis 11:1–9'>Ge 11:1–9</a> ). They point out that the same Hebrew word translated “lips” is also used in <a ref='Genesis 11:7'>Ge 11:7</a> . It is better, however, to understand the passage as pointing to a purification of heart and life. This is confirmed by the context (cf. <a ref='Zephaniah 3:13'>3:13</a> ) and corroborated by the fact that the word “language” is most commonly translated “lip,” as here. When combined with “pure,” the reference to speech speaks of inward cleansing from sin ( <a ref='Isaiah 6:5'>Is 6:5</a> ) manifested in speech (cf. <a ref='Matthew 12:34'>Mt 12:34</a> ), including the removal of the names of false gods from their lips ( <a ref='Hosea 2:17'>Hos 2:17</a> ). It does not imply a one world language. Outline I. Superscription ( <a ref='Zephaniah 1:1'>1:1</a> ) II. The Lord’s Judgment ( <a ref='Zephaniah 1:2–3:8'>1:2—3:8</a> ) A.

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Zephaniah 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>Hezekiah … Josiah.</b> Zephaniah traced his royal lineage back to his great-great-grandfather Hezekiah (ca. 715–686 BC) and placed his ministry contemporaneous with Josiah (ca. 640–609 BC). <a ref='Zephaniah 1:2–3'>1:2–3</a> The prophet began by noting the far fulfillment of the day of Yahweh, when even animal and physical creation will be affected by His judgment of the earth (cf. <a ref='Genesis 3:17–19'>Ge 3:17–19</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 12:29'>Ex 12:29</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 7:24–25'>Jos 7:24–25</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:22'>Ro 8:22</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>face of the ground.</b> The term is used in reference to the whole earth ( <a ref='Zephaniah 1:18'>1:18</a> ). The phraseology is reminiscent of the Noahic Flood ( <a ref='Genesis 6:7'>Ge 6:7</a> , <a ref='Genesis 6:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 7:21–23'>7:21–23</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 1:3'>1:3</a> Comparisons with the Genesis Flood continue with “man and beast” and “birds of the sky” ( <a ref='Genesis 6:7'>Ge 6:7</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 7:23'>7:23</a> ). The prophet also alluded to the creation, pairing man and beast (sixth day of creation) and birds with fish (fifth day of creation). <b>ruins.</b> An alternate translation is “stumbling blocks.” Whatever alienates man from God will be removed. <a ref='Zephaniah 1:4–9'>1:4–9</a> Yahweh narrowed His words of judgment to specifically focus on Judah, specifying the causes of judgment as apostasy and idolatry (vv. <a ref='Zephaniah 1:4–6'>4–6</a> ), as always coupled with moral and ethical corruption (vv. <a ref='Zephaniah 1:7–9'>7–9</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>cut off the remnant of Baal.</b> The worship of Baal, the Canaanite god of fertility, was a constant source of temptation to Israel (cf. <a ref='Numbers 25:1–5'>Nu 25:1–5</a> ; <a ref='Judges 2:13'>Jdg 2:13</a> ), as people tried worshiping him alongside the worship of Yahweh ( <a ref='Jeremiah 7:9'>Jer 7:9</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:25–29'>23:25–29</a> ). This mix became a primary cause for judgment ( <a ref='2 Kings 17:16–20'>2Ki 17:16–20</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 11:13–17'>Jer 11:13–17</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 2:8'>Hos 2:8</a> ) which would forever excise the worship of Baal from Israel. <a ref='Zephaniah 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>worship … the host of heaven.</b> Astrology was also a prominent part of Israel’s idolatrous practices; they worshiped the host of heaven from as early as the Exodus (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:19'>Dt 4:19</a> ; <a ref='Amos 5:25–26'>Am 5:25–26</a> ; <a ref='Acts 7:40–43'>Ac 7:40–43</a> ). God warned them repeatedly, but they rebelled ( <a ref='2 Kings 23:5–6'>2Ki 23:5–6</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 7:17–18'>Jer 7:17–18</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 8:2'>8:2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 44:17–25'>44:17–25</a> ). Altars were often erected on housetop roofs to provide a clear view of the sky ( <a ref='Jeremiah 8:2'>Jer 8:2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 19:13'>19:13</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 32:29'>32:29</a> ). <b>swear by Milcom.</b> Judah’s syncretistic worship was reflected in swearing by Yahweh and, at the same time, by Milcom, who may be either the Ammonite deity of <a ref='1 Kings 11:5'>1Ki 11:5</a> , <a ref='1 Kings 11:33'>33</a> , or Molech, the worship of whom included child sacrifice, astrology, and temple prostitution (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 18:21'>Lv 18:21</a> ; <a ref='Amos 5:25–26'>Am 5:25–26</a> ; <a ref='Acts 7:40–43'>Ac 7:40–43</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 1:6'>1:6</a> Zephaniah lastly mentioned those who had at first heeded calls to repentance but later had willfully turned away. <a ref='Zephaniah 1:7'>1:7</a> <b>Be silent.</b> In view of the just judgment, there was no defense to be spoken, and in view of the devastation, only shocked and mute wonder (cf. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:20'>Hab 2:20</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 2:13'>Zec 2:13</a> ). <b>day of Yahweh.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Joel 1:15'>Joel 1:15</a> .</i> <b>prepared a sacrifice … consecrated His guests.</b> God’s judgment on Israel was viewed as His sacrifice. The guests were the dreaded Babylonians, who as “priests” were invited to slay the sacrifice, i.e., Judah (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 13:3'>Is 13:3</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 34:6'>34:6</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 46:10'>Jer 46:10</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 39:17'>Eze 39:17</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 1:6'>Hab 1:6</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:17–18'>Rev 19:17–18</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>the princes … king’s sons.</b> Judgment began with the royal house. Lacking commitment to God’s covenant, they had adopted the customs and idolatrous practices of the heathen. Since Josiah was only 8 years old when he assumed rulership (ca. 640 BC), the reference would not be to his sons, but to the princes of the royal house or to the children of the king who would be ruling when the prophecy was fulfilled (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 25:7'>2Ki 25:7</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 39:6'>Jer 39:6</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>leap on the</b> temple <b>threshold.</b> Lit. “leap.” Perhaps this describes a pagan practice (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 5:5'>1Sa 5:5</a> ) now adapted by the Israelites. <a ref='Zephaniah 1:10–11'>1:10–11</a> The merchants, made wealthy from dishonest gain (cf. v. <a ref='Zephaniah 1:9'>9</a> ), were singled out to depict the anguish of the coming judgment. The Fish Gate, known today as the Damascus Gate, is located on the north side. The Second Quarter was a district within the city walls. “Mortar” was a name applied to the Valley of Siloam from its shape; it was a district where merchants carried on business. <a ref='Zephaniah 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>I will search.</b> None would escape the punishment of Yahweh ( <a ref='Amos 9:1–4'>Am 9:1–4</a> ). <b>stagnant in spirit.</b> See note . With this term referring to a thickened crust which forms on wine when left undisturbed for a long period of time, the prophet described the people’s indifference and slothfulness toward God. Their indifference led them to regard God as morally indifferent. <a ref='Zephaniah 1:14–18'>1:14–18</a> Zephaniah vividly described the day of Yahweh in staccato fashion, rehearsing the ominous conditions characterizing that day. This section seems to point to the near fulfillment when Babylon subdued Judah (vv. <a ref='Zephaniah 1:4–13'>4–13</a> ), as well as a far fulfillment which will involve the whole earth (v. <a ref='Zephaniah 1:18'>18</a> ). “Day of Yahweh” Fulfillments Near Far <a ref='Obadiah 1:1–14'>Obadiah 1–14</a> <a ref='Obadiah 1:15–21'>Obadiah 15–21</a> <a ref='Joel 1:15'>Joel 1:15</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:1'>2:1</a> , <a ref='Joel 2:11'>11</a> <a ref='Joel 2:31'>Joel 2:31</a> ( <a ref='Joel 3:1'>3:1</a> ); <a ref='Joel 3:14'>3:14</a> <a ref='Amos 5:18–20'>Amos 5:18–20</a> ——— ——— <a ref='Isaiah 2:12'>Isaiah 2:12</a> <a ref='Isaiah 13:6'>Isaiah 13:6</a> <a ref='Isaiah 13:9'>Isaiah 13:9</a> <a ref='Zephaniah 1:7'>Zephaniah 1:7</a> <a ref='Zephaniah 1:18'>Zephaniah 1:18</a> <a ref='Ezekiel 13:5'>Ezekiel 13:5</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 20:3'>20:3</a> ——— ——— <a ref='Zechariah 14:1'>Zechariah 14:1</a> ——— <a ref='Malachi 4:5'>Malachi 4:5</a> Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Zephaniah 1:16'>1:16</a> <b>day of trumpet and loud shouting.</b> In accordance with God’s instructions, a trumpet was fashioned for the purpose of sounding an alarm ( <a ref='Numbers 10:1–10'>Nu 10:1–10</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 1:17–18'>1:17–18</a> As though worthless, their blood and flesh were discarded as dust. Their silver and gold, corruptly gained (cf. vv. <a ref='Zephaniah 1:9–13'>9–13</a> ), would be of no avail to protect them from the wrath of holy God (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 46:28'>Jer 46:28</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 1:17'>1:17</a> <b>walk like the blind.</b> As blind men, they would grope unsuccessfully for escape routes ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:29'>Dt 28:29</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 1:18'>1:18</a> <b>all the earth.</b> The discussion expands to include the whole earth as in vv. <a ref='Zephaniah 1:2–3'>2–3</a> . <a ref='Zephaniah 2:1–3'>2:1–3</a> With the announcement of coming judgment, God mercifully invited His people to repent. They were to assemble to entreat the favor of Yahweh and avert His wrath (cf. <a ref='Joel 2:16'>Joel 2:16</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>nation without shame.</b> No longer sensitive to God’s call to repentance through His many prophets, Judah had sunk to shamelessness. <a ref='Zephaniah 2:3'>2:3</a> <b>Perhaps you will be hidden.</b> Even the humble, those who had followed the law of Yahweh, were encouraged to continue to manifest fruits of repentance, so they would be sheltered in the day of His judgment ( <a ref='Isaiah 26:20'>Is 26:20</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 2:4–15'>2:4–15</a> God used the heathen nations to punish His people, but He would not permit those nations to go unpunished. To illustrate this, 4 representative nations were chosen from the 4 points of the compass. <a ref='Zephaniah 2:4–7'>2:4–7</a> The first nation to be judged was Philistia, to the west of Israel. Judgment was to come swiftly and unexpectedly, even at noonday when it was least expected. Of the 5 Philistine cities, only Gath was omitted (cf. <a ref='Amos 1:6–8'>Am 1:6–8</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 2:5'>2:5</a> <b>Cherethites.</b> Occasionally a synonym for Philistia, this term represented a branch from Crete ( <i>see note on <a ref='Ezekiel 25:16'>Eze 25:16</a></i> ). David’s bodyguard was comprised of both Cherethites and Pelethites ( <a ref='2 Samuel 8:18'>2Sa 8:18</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 1:38'>1Ki 1:38</a> , <a ref='1 Kings 1:44'>44</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='1 Samuel 30:14'>1Sa 30:14</a> .</i> <a ref='Zephaniah 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>restore their fortune.</b> Yahweh would initiate the physical return of Israel’s exiles to occupy the land vacated by judgment on Philistia. <a ref='Zephaniah 2:8–11'>2:8–11</a> To the east, the descendants of Lot by his daughters through incest, Moab and Ammon ( <a ref='Genesis 19:30–38'>Ge 19:30–38</a> ), are mentioned. They had reproached and reviled God’s people, incurring divine wrath (cf. <a ref='Genesis 12:3'>Ge 12:3</a> ). Like Sodom and Gomorrah in the days of their ancestor Lot, they too would come to ruin and desolation. <a ref='Zephaniah 2:11'>2:11</a> <b>all the coastlands of the nations will bow down to Him.</b> The final fulfillment of these predictions is yet future, depicting the Millennium when all the gods of the nations will be reduced to nothing and Yahweh Himself will be worshiped universally ( <a ref='Isaiah 66:18–21'>Is 66:18–21</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:16'>Zec 14:16</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 1:11'>Mal 1:11</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 2:12'>2:12</a> Ethiopia lay to the south of Israel. She would be judged by His sword, fulfilled in Nebuchadnezzar’s invasion and conquest of Egypt ( <a ref='Ezekiel 30:24–25'>Eze 30:24–25</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 2:13–15'>2:13–15</a> Assyria, located northeast of Israel, would be desolated as well. Nineveh fell, shortly after this prophecy, to the Babylonians in 612 BC. Famed for her irrigation system, she would be left dry. <a ref='Zephaniah 2:15'>2:15</a> In language similar to that of the king of Babylon ( <a ref='Isaiah 14:13–14'>Is 14:13–14</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 47:8'>47:8</a> ) and the prince of Tyre ( <a ref='Ezekiel 28:2'>Eze 28:2</a> ), Assyria had claimed for herself divine attributes. For this she would be brought to ruin. <a ref='Zephaniah 3:1–7'>3:1–7</a> After pronouncing judgment on the nations, the prophet returned to again pronounce woe upon Jerusalem. Because of that city’s favored position among the nations (cf. <a ref='Exodus 19:5'>Ex 19:5</a> ), more was expected. <a ref='Zephaniah 3:2'>3:2</a> <b>She did not receive discipline.</b> Jerusalem was soon to learn that to reject God’s correction leads to destruction ( <a ref='Proverbs 5:23'>Pr 5:23</a> ). <b>She did not draw near to her God.</b> Yahweh had taken up residence in that city, making Him easily accessible ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:7'>Dt 4:7</a> ), yet they had refused to draw near to Him in proper worship. <a ref='Zephaniah 3:3–5'>3:3–5</a> Four classes of leadership were singled out for condemnation: The political leaders, i.e., the 1) princes and 2) judges; who are both likened to ravenous wolves, endlessly searching for more prey (cf. <a ref='Zephaniah 1:8–9'>1:8–9</a> ). The spiritual leaders, i.e., the 3) prophets and 4) priests, were unfaithful to Yahweh whom they claimed to represent. By contrast, Yahweh never failed to manifest a faithful standard of justice and righteousness. <a ref='Zephaniah 3:6–7'>3:6–7</a> The desolations brought by Yahweh on surrounding nations were to serve as warnings to Judah, meant to turn His people back to Him. But instead, enticed by the fruits of corruption, the people rose early to zealously and deliberately pursue the way of sin. <a ref='Zephaniah 3:8'>3:8</a> The prophet transitions from the historical invasion of Judah by Babylon to the future day of Yahweh. He speaks of the Great Tribulation, when Yahweh will gather all the nations for judgment (cf. <a ref='Joel 3:1–2'>Joel 3:1–2</a> , <a ref='Joel 3:12–17'>12–17</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 12:2–3'>Zec 12:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:2'>14:2</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:21'>Mt 24:21</a> ). The faithful remnant, presumably the meek of <a ref='Zephaniah 2:1–3'>2:1–3</a> , are exhorted to wait in trust for Him to carry out His judgment. <a ref='Zephaniah 3:9–20'>3:9–20</a> The final section unveils the blessings of restoration for God’s people and the nations. <a ref='Zephaniah 3:9'>3:9</a> <b>purified lips.</b> See Introduction: Interpretive Challenges . A remnant of the nations, converted to Yahweh, will worship Him in righteousness and truth ( <a ref='Zechariah 8:20–23'>Zec 8:20–23</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:16'>14:16</a> ). Pure speech will come from purified hearts (cf. <a ref='Luke 6:45'>Lk 6:45</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 3:10'>3:10</a> They will return from distant places (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:11'>Is 11:11</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 11:15–16'>15–16</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 27:13'>27:13</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 3:11–13'>3:11–13</a> Yahweh will purge the proud and ungodly from among them ( <a ref='Zechariah 13:1–6'>Zec 13:1–6</a> ), leaving a meek and humble people. Material prosperity and peace will accompany them as well, allowing them to enjoy the rich blessings of God undisturbed ( <a ref='Joel 3:18–20'>Joel 3:18–20</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:4'>Mic 4:4</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 3:14–20'>3:14–20</a> The messianic era of millennial blessing and restoration is described. <a ref='Zephaniah 3:15–17'>3:15–17</a> The basis for rejoicing in v. <a ref='Zephaniah 3:14'>14</a> is that Israel’s day of judgment is past, and her King is residing in her midst. His departure just prior to Nebuchadnezzar’s destruction of the temple is graphically depicted in <a ref='Eze 8-11'>Eze 8–11</a> ; but He will return as Lord and Messiah, a fact so glorious that it is repeated in v. <a ref='Zephaniah 3:17'>17</a> . <a ref='Zephaniah 3:17'>3:17</a> As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 62:4'>Is 62:4</a> ), Yahweh will exult over His people with gladness and song, resting in quiet ecstasy over His people in whom is all His delight (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:9'>Dt 30:9</a> ; <a ref='Is 54'>Is 54</a> ). <a ref='Zephaniah 3:18'>3:18</a> <b>those who grieve about the appointed feasts.</b> Unable to celebrate the appointed feasts (cf. <a ref='Exodus 23:14–17'>Ex 23:14–17</a> ) while in exile, the godly remnant sorrowed.
