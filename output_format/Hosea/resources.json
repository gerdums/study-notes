    "content": "The Book of Hosea Title The title is derived from the main character and author of the book. The meaning of his name, “salvation,” is the same as that of Joshua (cf. <a ref='Numbers 13:8'>Nu 13:8</a> , <a ref='Numbers 13:16'>16</a> ) and Jesus ( <a ref='Matthew 1:21'>Mt 1:21</a> ). Hosea is the first of the 12 Minor Prophets. “Minor” refers to the brevity of the prophecies, as compared to the length of the works of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel. Author and Date The book of Hosea is the sole source of information about the author. Little is known about him, and even less about his father, Beeri ( <a ref='Hosea 1:1'>1:1</a> ). Hosea was probably a native of the northern kingdom of Israel, since he shows familiarity with the history, circumstances, and topography of the north (cf. <a ref='Hosea 4:15'>4:15</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 5:1'>5:1</a> , <a ref='Hosea 5:13'>13</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 6:8–9'>6:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 10:5'>10:5</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 12:11–12'>12:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 14:6'>14:6</a> ). This would make him and Jonah the only writing prophets from the northern kingdom. Although he addressed both Israel (the northern kingdom) and Judah (the southern kingdom), he identified the king of Israel as “our king” ( <a ref='Hosea 7:5'>7:5</a> ). Hosea had a lengthy period of ministry, prophesying ca. 755–710 BC, during the reigns of Uzziah (790–739 BC), Jotham (750–731 BC), Ahaz (735–715 BC), and Hezekiah (715–686 BC) in Judah, and Jeroboam II (793–753 BC) in Israel ( <a ref='Hosea 1:1'>1:1</a> ). His long career spanned the last 6 kings of Israel from Zechariah (753–752 BC) to Hoshea (732–722 BC). The overthrow of Zechariah (the last of the dynasty of Jehu) in 752 BC is depicted as yet future ( <a ref='Hosea 1:4'>1:4</a> ). Thus he followed Amos’ preaching in the north, and was a contemporary of Isaiah and Micah as well, both of whom prophesied in Judah. <a ref='2Ki 14-20'>Second Kings 14–20</a> and <a ref='2Ch 26-32'>2 Chronicles 26–32</a> record the historical period of Hosea’s ministry. Background and Setting Hosea began his ministry to Israel (also called Ephraim, after its largest tribe) during the final days of Jeroboam II, under whose guidance Israel was enjoying both political peace and material prosperity as well as moral corruption and spiritual bankruptcy. Upon Jeroboam II’s death (753 BC), however, anarchy prevailed and Israel declined rapidly. Until her overthrow by Assyria 30 years later, 4 of Israel’s 6 kings were assassinated by their successors. Prophesying during the days surrounding the fall of Samaria, Hosea focuses on Israel’s moral waywardness (cf. the book of Amos) and her breach of the covenantal relationship with the Lord, announcing that judgment was imminent. Circumstances were not much better in the southern kingdom. Usurping the priestly function, Uzziah had been struck with leprosy ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 26:16–21'>2Chr 26:16–21</a> ); Jotham condoned idolatrous practices, opening the way for Ahaz to encourage Baal worship ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 27:1–28:4'>2Chr 27:1—28:4</a> ). Hezekiah’s revival served only to slow Judah’s acceleration toward a fate similar to that of her northern sister. Weak kings on both sides of the border repeatedly sought out alliances with their heathen neighbors ( <a ref='Hosea 7:11'>7:11</a> ; cf. <a ref='2 Kings 15:19'>2Ki 15:19</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 16:7'>16:7</a> ) rather than seeking the Lord’s help. Historical and Theological Themes The theme of Hosea is God’s loyal love for His covenant people, Israel, in spite of their idolatry. Thus Hosea has been called the St. John (the apostle of love) of the OT. The Lord’s true love for His people is unending and will tolerate no rival. Hosea’s message contains much condemnation, both national and individual, but at the same time, he poignantly portrays the love of God toward His people with passionate emotion. Hosea was instructed by God to marry a certain woman and experience with her a domestic life which was a dramatization of the sin and unfaithfulness of Israel. The marital life of Hosea and his wife, Gomer, provide the rich metaphor which clarifies the themes of the book: sin, judgment, and forgiving love. Interpretive Challenges That the faithless wife, Gomer, is symbolic of faithless Israel is without doubt; but questions remain. First, some suggest that the marital scenes in chaps. <a ref='Ho 1-3'>1–3</a> should be taken only as allegory. However, there is nothing in the narrative, presented in simple prose, which would even question its literal occurrence. Much of its impact would be lost if not literal. When nonliteral elements within the book are introduced, they are prefaced with “saw” ( <a ref='Hosea 5:13'>5:13</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 9:10'>9:10</a> , <a ref='Hosea 9:13'>13</a> ), the normal Hebraic means of introducing nonliteral scenes. Furthermore, there is no account of a prophet ever making himself the subject of an allegory or parable. Second, what are the moral implications of God’s command for Hosea to marry a prostitute? It appears best to see Gomer as chaste at the time of marriage to Hosea, only later having become an immoral woman. The words “take for yourself a wife of harlotry” are to be understood proleptically, i.e., looking to the future. An immoral woman could not serve as a picture of Israel coming out of Egypt ( <a ref='Hosea 2:15'>2:15</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 9:10'>9:10</a> ), who then later wandered away from God ( <a ref='Hosea 11:1'>11:1</a> ). Chapter <a ref='Ho 3'>3</a> describes Hosea taking back his wife, who had been rejected because of adultery, a rejection that was unjustifiable if Hosea had married a prostitute with full knowledge of her character. A third question arises concerning the relationship between chap. <a ref='Ho 1'>1</a> and chap. <a ref='Ho 3'>3</a> and whether the woman of chap. <a ref='Ho 3'>3</a> is Gomer or another woman. There are a number of factors which suggest that the woman of chap. <a ref='Ho 3'>3</a> is Gomer. In <a ref='Hosea 1:2'>1:2</a> , God’s command is to “Go, take”; in <a ref='Hosea 3:1'>3:1</a> , however, His command is to “Go again, love,” suggesting that Hosea’s love was to be renewed to the same woman. Furthermore, within the analogy of chap. <a ref='Ho 1'>1</a> , Gomer represents Israel. As God renews His love toward faithless Israel, so Hosea is to renew his love toward faithless Gomer. For <a ref='Ho 3'>Hos 3</a> to denote a different woman would confuse the analogy. Outline I. Adulterous Wife and Faithful Husband ( <a ref='Hosea 1:1–3:5'>1:1—3:5</a> ) A.

The children were possibly not fathered by Hosea. That Hosea’s marriage to Gomer was to depict God’s marriage to Israel is clearly set forth and becomes the key to the theme of the book. <a ref='Hosea 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>Jezreel.</b> Meaning “God will scatter” (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 10:9'>Zec 10:9</a> ), the name is given to the child so named, as a prediction of judgment (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 9:7–10:28'>2Ki 9:7—10:28</a> ). <b>I will visit the bloodshed of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu.</b> It was at the city of Jezreel where Jehu slaughtered the house of Ahab (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 9:7–10:28'>2Ki 9:7—10:28</a> ). <b>cause … to cease.</b> Looks forward to the exile of Israel to Assyria in 722 BC, from which she never returned.

Fulfillment came in 722 BC when Assyria invaded. <b>the valley of Jezreel.</b> Jezreel, called Esdraelon, extends 10 mi. in breadth from the Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea, near Carmel; it was the great battlefield (see <a ref='Revelation 16:14–16'>Rev 16:14–16</a> ) adjoining the Valley of Megiddo, which will become an avenue of blessing (cf. v. <a ref='Hosea 1:11'>11</a> ) when Christ returns in triumph. <a ref='Hosea 1:6'>1:6</a> <b>Lo-ruhamah.</b> Lit. “not pitied,” this daughter is named to symbolize God bringing judgment on Israel, no longer extending His favor towards them. <a ref='Hosea 1:7'>1:7</a> <b>I will have compassion on … Judah.</b> God chose to intervene on behalf of Hezekiah when Jerusalem was besieged at the hands of the Assyrians in 701 BC (cf. <a ref='2Ki 19'>2Ki 19</a> ; <a ref='Is 37'>Is 37</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>Lo-ammi.</b> The name means “not My people” and symbolizes God’s rejection of Israel. <b>I am not your God.</b> Lit. “I am no longer ‘I am’ to you.” The phrase gives the breaking of the covenant, a kind of divorce formula, in contrast to the covenant or marriage formula “I AM WHO I AM” given in <a ref='Exodus 3:14'>Ex 3:14</a> . <a ref='Hosea 1:10–2:1'>1:10—2:1</a> In spite of the waywardness of Israel, God preserved a remnant for Himself from both Israel and Judah. Speaking of millennial blessings, God promised national increase (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 54:1'>Is 54:1</a> ), national conversion and reunion (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:15–23'>Eze 37:15–23</a> ), national leadership ( <a ref='Hosea 3:5'>3:5</a> ), and national restoration ( <a ref='Hosea 2:23'>2:23</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 1:10'>1:10</a> <b>number.</b> A reaffirmation of the Abrahamic Covenant, not to be fulfilled in this generation but in the future (cf. <a ref='Genesis 22:17'>Ge 22:17</a> ). <b>not My people.</b> Quoted by Paul in <a ref='Romans 9:26'>Ro 9:26</a> . <a ref='Hosea 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>one head.</b> Refers to Messiah (cf. <a ref='Hosea 3:5'>3:5</a> ). <b>day of Jezreel.</b> Here used positively in the sense of divine blessing (cf. <a ref='Hosea 2:22'>2:22</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>Contend with your mother.</b> Although the language is applicable to Gomer, it depicts a courtroom scene in which Yahweh, as the plaintiff, brings charges against the defendant. Individual Israelites, depicted as the children, are commanded to bring charges against their mother, Israel, as a nation. The physical immorality of Gomer pictures the spiritual idolatry of Israel. <a ref='Hosea 2:5'>2:5</a> <b>I will go.</b> Lit. “Let me go,” it denotes strong desire and bent. Israel attributed her prosperity to the idols of her heathen neighbors, her “lovers” (cf. vv. <a ref='Hosea 2:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Hosea 2:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Hosea 2:12'>12</a> ). She would not be deterred from pursuing them. <a ref='Hosea 2:8–13'>2:8–13</a> God withheld rain and productivity to show Israel that the Canaanite god Baal was not the god of rain and fertility. <a ref='Hosea 2:8'>2:8</a> <b>used for Baal.</b> Baal (the Phoenician sun-god) worship, already present during the time of the judges (cf. <a ref='Judges 2:17'>Jdg 2:17</a> ; <a ref='Judges 3:3'>3:3</a> ; <a ref='Judges 8:33'>8:33</a> ), became established in Israel when King Ahab married Jezebel, who attempted to obliterate Israelite worship of the true God (cf. <a ref='1Ki 19'>1Ki 19</a> ). Offerings to Baal actually came from God’s dowry to Israel (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:10–14'>Eze 16:10–14</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 2:10'>2:10</a> <b>I will uncover her lewdness.</b> God pledged to expose Israel’s wickedness. The phrase is linked to being taken forcibly into captivity in <a ref='Ezekiel 16:37–40'>Eze 16:37–40</a> . <b>her lovers.</b> The idols were personified as if they could see, though they could offer no help. <a ref='Hosea 2:11'>2:11</a> <b>feasts.</b> Ever since the Exodus from Egypt, Israel had intermingled the worship of Yahweh with the worship of false gods (cf. <a ref='Amos 5:26'>Am 5:26</a> ; <a ref='Acts 7:43'>Ac 7:43</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 2:13'>2:13</a> <b>she forgot Me.</b> Cf. <a ref='2 Kings 17:7–18'>2Ki 17:7–18</a> for a detailed description of what their abandonment of God involved. <a ref='Hosea 2:14'>2:14</a> <b>speak to her heart.</b> The phrase was used of wooing ( <a ref='Genesis 34:3'>Ge 34:3</a> ; <a ref='Judges 19:3'>Jdg 19:3</a> ; <a ref='Ruth 2:13'>Ru 2:13</a> ). God will restore Israel to Himself. <a ref='Hosea 2:15'>2:15</a> <b>valley of Achor.</b> Lit. “valley of Trouble,” near Jericho where Achan and his family were judged ( <a ref='Joshua 7:24'>Jos 7:24</a> ). This reference alerts Israel that her discipline and judgment would not last forever because there is a “door of hope.” <a ref='Hosea 2:16'>2:16</a> <b>Ishi … Baali.</b> The former (lit. “husband”) denotes affection and intimacy, while the latter (lit. “master”) speaks of rulership. <a ref='Hosea 2:17'>2:17</a> In v. <a ref='Hosea 2:13'>13</a> , Israel forgot her true God; God said she would forget her false gods. What the outward conformity to the Mosaic Covenant could not do, God does through a new, regenerated heart in the New Covenant ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer 31:31–34</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 13:1–2'>Zec 13:1–2</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 2:18'>2:18</a> <b>a covenant.</b> This depicts a millennial scene (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 2:4'>Is 2:4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:6–9'>11:6–9</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:3'>Mic 4:3</a> ) when God’s people become subject to God and creation becomes subject to them. <a ref='Hosea 2:19–20'>2:19–20</a> <b>I will betroth you.</b> Repeated 3 times, the term emphasizes the intensity of God’s restoring love for the nation. In that day, Israel will no longer be thought of as a prostitute. Israel brings nothing to the marriage; God makes all the promises and provides all the dowry. These verses are recited by every orthodox Jew as he places the phylacteries on his hand and forehead (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:18'>Dt 11:18</a> ). The regeneration/conversion of the nation is much like that of an individual (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:16–19'>2Co 5:16–19</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 2:22–23'>2:22–23</a> A reversal of circumstances (cf. <a ref='Hosea 1:4'>1:4</a> , <a ref='Hosea 1:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Hosea 1:9'>9</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 2:22'>2:22</a> <b>Jezreel.</b> As in <a ref='Hosea 1:11'>1:11</a> , used here in the positive sense of scattering seed to sow it. <a ref='Hosea 2:23'>2:23</a> Quoted by Paul in <a ref='Romans 9:25'>Ro 9:25</a> . <a ref='Hosea 3:1'>3:1</a> <b>Go again, love.</b> Having been previously separated, Hosea was commanded to pursue his estranged wife Gomer (cf. Introduction: Interpretive Challenges ), thereby illustrating God’s unquenchable love for faithless Israel. <b>raisin cakes.</b> Eaten as a part of special occasions (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 6:19'>2Sa 6:19</a> ), they may have been used in idolatrous ceremonies, possibly as an aphrodisiac (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:5'>SS 2:5</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 3:2'>3:2</a> <b>bargained for her.</b> Probably from a slave auction, Hosea purchased Gomer for 15 shekels of silver and 1 1/2 homers of barley. Together, the total may have equaled 30 pieces of silver, the price paid for a common slave (cf. <a ref='Exodus 21:32'>Ex 21:32</a> ). Barley was the offering of one accused of adultery ( <a ref='Numbers 5:15'>Nu 5:15</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 3:3–5'>3:3–5</a> Gomer would not be allowed conjugal relations for “many days,” with any man, including Hosea. As a further element of the picture of God’s dealings with His covenant people during the present age, Israel would exist without her existing political and religious (both true and false) relations until Messiah returns at the Second Advent to set up His millennial reign (cf. <a ref='Eze 40-48'>Eze 40–48</a> ; <a ref='Zec 12-14'>Zec 12–14</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 3:4'>3:4</a> <b>without ephod or household idols.</b> Idolatrous items of priestly clothing and objects of worship. <a ref='Hosea 3:5'>3:5</a> <b>David.</b> Cf. <a ref='Hosea 1:11'>1:11</a> . This must refer to Messiah during the Millennium, as “in the last days” specifies (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 55:3–4'>Is 55:3–4</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 30:9'>Jer 30:9</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 34:23–24'>Eze 34:23–24</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 37:24–25'>37:24–25</a> ). The Jews did not seek after Christ at His first advent. This reference has the Davidic Covenant as its background (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 7:12–17'>2Sa 7:12–17</a> ; <a ref='Ps 39'>Pss 39</a> ; <a ref='Ps 132'>132</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 4:1'>4:1</a> <b>Yahweh has a contention.</b> Turning from the analogy of his own marriage, the prophet made the judicial charge in God’s indictment against Israel. <a ref='Hosea 4:2'>4:2</a> Note the many infractions of the Ten Commandments (cf. <a ref='Exodus 20:3–17'>Ex 20:3–17</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 4:3'>4:3</a> Sin plays havoc with lower creation and nature (cf. <a ref='Joel 1:17–20'>Joel 1:17–20</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:19–22'>Ro 8:19–22</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 4:4'>4:4</a> <b>let no man contend.</b> Rationalizing and denying their wrongs, the people protested their innocence, like those who would not humbly accept the decision of the priests (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:8–13'>Dt 17:8–13</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 4:5'>4:5</a> <b>your mother.</b> The Israelite nation of which the people are the children (cf. <a ref='Hosea 2:2'>2:2</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 4:6'>4:6</a> <b>reject you from ministering as My priest.</b> Having rejected Yahweh’s instruction, Israel could no longer serve as His priest to the nations (cf. <a ref='Exodus 19:6'>Ex 19:6</a> ; <a ref='James 3:1'>Jas 3:1</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 4:7–10'>4:7–10</a> Their position of power and glory, abused in succeeding generations by the eating of the sin offerings, would be turned to shame. Being no different from the people, the priests, who should have been faithful, would share their punishment (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 24:1–3'>Is 24:1–3</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 4:11'>4:11</a> Here is a moral truth applicable to all people and times. Verses <a ref='Hosea 4:12–13'>12–13</a> are illustrations of the enslavement in Israel. <a ref='Hosea 4:12'>4:12</a> <b>spirit of harlotry.</b> A prevailing mindset and inclination to worldly spiritual immorality, i.e., idolatry (cf. <a ref='Hosea 5:4'>5:4</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 4:13'>4:13</a> Bereft of righteous teaching and understanding, they sacrificed to idols. Hilltops and groves of trees were favorite places for idolatrous worship (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:2'>Dt 12:2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 2:20'>Jer 2:20</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 6:13'>Eze 6:13</a> ), including religious prostitution. <a ref='Hosea 4:14'>4:14</a> Although all who sin will be judged, God forbade punishing the adulteresses alone and leaving the men who patronized them to go free. The heaviest punishment would not be on the women who sin, but the fathers and husbands who set such a bad example by their engagement with prostitutes. <b>without understanding.</b> Cf. <a ref='Hosea 4:6'>4:6</a> . <a ref='Hosea 4:15'>4:15</a> <b>Gilgal.</b> Between Jordan and Jericho in the area of Samaria, this was once a holy place to God ( <a ref='Joshua 5:10–15'>Jos 5:10–15</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 10:8'>1Sa 10:8</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 15:21'>15:21</a> ), afterwards desecrated by idol worship (cf. <a ref='Hosea 9:15'>9:15</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 12:11'>12:11</a> ; <a ref='Amos 4:4'>Am 4:4</a> ; <a ref='Amos 5:5'>5:5</a> ). <b>Beth-aven.</b> Judah was to stay away from Israel’s centers of false worship, including Beth-aven (“house of wickedness/deceit”). This was a deliberate substitution for the name Bethel (“house of God”), once sacred to God ( <a ref='Genesis 28:17'>Ge 28:17</a> , <a ref='Genesis 28:19'>19</a> ), but made by Jeroboam a place to worship calves (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 12:28–33'>1Ki 12:28–33</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 13:1'>13:1</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 48:13'>Jer 48:13</a> ; <a ref='Amos 3:14'>Am 3:14</a> ; <a ref='Amos 7:13'>7:13</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 4:16'>4:16</a> Because Israel was like a stubborn calf, God no longer attempted to corral her, abandoning her as a lamb in a vast wilderness. <a ref='Hosea 4:17'>4:17</a> <b>Ephraim … Let him alone.</b> As the largest and most influential of the northern 10 tribes, Ephraim’s name was often used as representative of the northern nation. This was an expression of God’s wrath of abandonment. When sinners reject Him and are bent on fulfilling their wicked purposes, God removes restraining grace and turns them over to the results of their own perverse choices. This kind of wrath is that in <a ref='Romans 1:18–32'>Ro 1:18–32</a> (cf. <a ref='Judges 10:13'>Jdg 10:13</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 15:2'>2Chr 15:2</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 24:20'>24:20</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 81:11–12'>Ps 81:11–12</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 5:1'>5:1</a> Hosea addressed the priests, the people, and the royal family; the 3 imperatives demand attention. The religious and civil leaders had entrapped the people (cf. <a ref='Hosea 6:9'>6:9</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 7:7'>7:7</a> ). <b>Mizpah … Tabor.</b> Mizpah of Gilead, lying east of the Jordan ( <a ref='Judges 10:17'>Jdg 10:17</a> ; <a ref='Judges 11:29'>11:29</a> ), and Tabor, southwest of the Sea of Galilee, were likely places for false worship. <a ref='Hosea 5:5'>5:5</a> <b>pride of Israel answers against him.</b> Israel’s pride in idolatry provided self-incrimination (cf. <a ref='Hosea 7:10'>7:10</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 5:6–7'>5:6–7</a> Her religious sacrifices and monthly festivals no longer brought divine favor, only judgment.

Worse, Israel’s leaders were moving spiritual lines established by God (cf. v. <a ref='Hosea 5:11'>11</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 5:12'>5:12</a> <b>moth … rottenness.</b> God will be destructive to Israel. <a ref='Hosea 5:13'>5:13</a> <b>King Jareb.</b> “Jareb” means “warrior” and refers to the king of Assyria, to whom Israel (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 15:19–20'>2Ki 15:19–20</a> ) and later Judah (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 16:5–9'>2Ki 16:5–9</a> ) turned for help. <a ref='Hosea 5:14–15'>5:14–15</a> Foreign assistance would be of no value, since Yahweh was orchestrating punishment at the hands of the Assyrians. He would remove Himself until “they acknowledge their guilt” and “seek My face” (cf. <a ref='Hosea 3:5'>3:5</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 6:1–3'>6:1–3</a> Coming with the beginning of Christ’s millennial reign (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–13:1'>Zec 12:10—13:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 43:1–6'>Is 43:1–6</a> ), Hosea records Israel’s future words of repentance (cf. <a ref='Hosea 5:15'>5:15</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 6:2'>6:2</a> <b>after two days … on the third day.</b> Not a reference to the resurrection of Christ (illness, not death, is in the context), but to the quickness of healing and restoration (cf. the quickness with which the dry bones of <a ref='Eze 37'>Eze 37</a> respond).

A few Judean refugees actually did go to Egypt (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 25:26'>2Ki 25:26</a> ).

See <a ref='Matthew 2:15'>Mt 2:15</a> for Matthew’s analogical use of this verse in relationship to Jesus Christ. <a ref='Hosea 11:3–4'>11:3–4</a> Yahweh’s endearing word pictures are reflected in Ezekiel’s touching descriptions of Israel’s early years (cf. <a ref='Eze 16'>Eze 16</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 11:5'>11:5</a> <b>will not return to … Egypt.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Hosea 8:13'>8:13</a> .</i> <a ref='Hosea 11:5–7'>11:5–7</a> In spite of His tender care, Israel was ungrateful, demanding punishment (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:21'>Ro 1:21</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 11:7'>11:7</a> <b>turning.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Proverbs 14:14'>Pr 14:14</a> .</i> <a ref='Hosea 11:8'>11:8</a> <b>Admah … Zeboiim.</b> Because of Yahweh’s great love for Ephraim, it was painful to punish her as He did these two cities, which were destroyed with Sodom and Gomorrah (cf. <a ref='Genesis 10:19'>Ge 10:19</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 19:23–25'>19:23–25</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:23'>Dt 29:23</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 11:9'>11:9</a> <b>I will not make Ephraim a ruin again.</b> The destruction referred to that inflicted by Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser, who deprived Israel of Gilead, Galilee, and Naphtali ( <a ref='2 Kings 15:29'>2Ki 15:29</a> ). Ultimately, it referred to the promise that after the long dispersion God would, in mercy, restore His people in the kingdom, never to be destroyed again. <a ref='Hosea 11:10'>11:10</a> <b>will roar like a lion.</b> Though Yahweh would, as a lion, roar against Israel in judgment (cf. <a ref='Amos 1:2'>Am 1:2</a> ), He would also roar for the purpose of calling, protecting, and blessing (cf. <a ref='Joel 3:16'>Joel 3:16</a> ). <b>from the west.</b> Returns from Assyrian and Babylonian captivities were from the east. This undoubtedly has reference to His return at the Second Advent to set up the millennial kingdom (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:11–12'>Is 11:11–12</a> ), when He calls Israel from their worldwide dispersion and reverses the judgment of <a ref='Hosea 9:17'>9:17</a> . <a ref='Hosea 12:1'>12:1</a> Israel’s attempted alliances with heathen neighbors were of no worth. This prophecy was delivered at about the time of Israel’s seeking the aid of the Egyptian king. <a ref='Hosea 12:2'>12:2</a> <b>Jacob.</b> Frequently used interchangeably with “Israel” (cf. <a ref='Hosea 10:11'>10:11</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 32:28'>Ge 32:28</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 12:3–6'>12:3–6</a> He exhorted them to follow their father Jacob’s persevering prayerfulness, which brought God’s favor on him. As God is unchanging, He would show the same favor to Jacob’s posterity as He did to Jacob, if, like him, they sought God. <a ref='Hosea 12:7'>12:7</a> <b>merchant.</b> Because the Canaanites were known as traders, the word “merchant” came to be used synonymously with “Canaanite” (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:29'>Eze 16:29</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 17:4'>17:4</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 1:11'>Zep 1:11</a> ). Though she denied it (v. <a ref='Hosea 12:8'>8</a> ), Israel had become materialistic, filled with greed, and fond of dishonest gain. <a ref='Hosea 12:9'>12:9</a> At the annual Feast of Booths, or Tabernacles ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:13–15'>Dt 16:13–15</a> ; cf. <a ref='Numbers 29:12–38'>Nu 29:12–38</a> ), Israel dwelt in tents to commemorate her 40 years of wilderness wanderings. In captivity, she would be forced to live in them permanently. <a ref='Hosea 12:10'>12:10</a> And <b>I have spoken.</b> Here is an aggravation of their guilt. It was not through ignorance that they sinned, but in defiance of God’s revealed Word. <a ref='Hosea 12:11'>12:11</a> <b>heaps beside the furrows.</b> As gathered and piled stones would dot a farmer’s field, so Israel multiplied her stone altars across the land. “Gilgal” means “a heap of stones,” so this is a play on words. <a ref='Hosea 12:12–14'>12:12–14</a> The reference to Jacob’s wanderings to Syria and Israel’s sojourn in Egypt should cause Ephraim to confess her pride, recognize her humble origins, and acknowledge that only by God’s gracious power were they made a nation. <a ref='Hosea 13:1'>13:1</a> <b>trembling.</b> When Ephraim, the most powerful tribe, spoke early in Israel’s history, it was with authority and produced fear. <b>died.</b> Because of his sins and in spite of being feared, Ephraim died, spiritually and now nationally. <a ref='Hosea 13:2'>13:2</a> <b>kiss the calves!</b> An act of devotion to their idols (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 19:18'>1Ki 19:18</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 13:4–6'>13:4–6</a> Having entered into a marriage covenant with Yahweh, Israel was to remain faithful to Him alone (cf. <a ref='Exodus 20:2–3'>Ex 20:2–3</a> ); yet she forgot Him. <a ref='Hosea 13:7–8'>13:7–8</a> The lion, leopard, and bear are all native to Israel. Her Protector would now become to her as a wild beast, tearing and devouring (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 26:21–22'>Lv 26:21–22</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:24'>Dt 32:24</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 14:21'>Eze 14:21</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 13:12'>13:12</a> <b>bound up … stored up.</b> Israel’s sins are all well-documented and safely preserved for the day of reckoning (cf. <a ref='Hosea 7:2'>7:2</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:34–35'>Dt 32:34–35</a> ; <a ref='Job 14:17'>Job 14:17</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 13:13'>13:13</a> <b>at the opening of the womb.</b> This refers to the birth canal. Employing this figure of giving birth, Yahweh likens Ephraim to an unwise child, unwilling to move through to birth. By long deferring a “new birth” with repentance, the nation was like a child remaining in the canal dangerously long and risking death (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 19:3'>2Ki 19:3</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 37:3'>Is 37:3</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 66:9'>66:9</a> ). <a ref='Hosea 13:14'>13:14</a> Placing the strong affirmation of deliverance so abruptly after a denunciation intensified the wonder of His unrequited love (cf. <a ref='Hosea 11:8–9'>11:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 26:44'>Lv 26:44</a> ). This can apply to God’s restoration of Israel from Assyria, and in future times from all the lands of the dispersion, preserving them and bringing them back to their land for the kingdom of Messiah ( <a ref='Eze 37'>Eze 37</a> ). It also speaks of the time of personal resurrection as in <a ref='Daniel 12:2–3'>Da 12:2–3</a> . Repentant Israelites will be restored to the land and even raised from death to glory. Paul uses this text in <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:55'>1Co 15:55</a> (quoting the LXX) to celebrate the future resurrection of the church.
