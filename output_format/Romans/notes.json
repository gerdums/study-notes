Although in Greek culture it most often referred to the involuntary, permanent service of a slave, Paul elevates this word by using it in its Hebrew sense to describe a servant who willingly commits himself to serve a master he loves and respects ( Ex 21:5–6 ; Ga 1:10 ; Tit 1:1 ; cf. Ge 26:24 ; Nu 12:7 ; 2Sa 7:5 ; Is 53:11 ). apostle. The Greek word means “one who is sent.” In the NT, it primarily refers to the 12 men Christ chose to accompany Him ( Mk 3:13–19 ) and Matthias, whom the other apostles chose to replace Judas ( Ac 1:15–26 ). Christ gave them power to confirm their apostleship with miracles ( Mt 10:1 ; 2Co 12:12 ), and authority to speak as His proxies—every NT book was written either by an apostle or under his auspices (cf. Jn 14:26 ). Their teaching is the foundation of the church ( Eph 2:20 ). Christ Himself selected Paul for this position ( Ac 9:15 ; 22:14 ; 26:16 ; cf. Ga 1:1 ) and trained him to fulfill this ministry ( Ga 1:12 , 16 ). gospel of God. Used in its verb and noun forms some 60 times in this epistle, the Greek word for this phrase means “good news” (see Mk 1:1 ). Rome incorporated it into its emperor worship. The town herald used this word to begin important favorable announcements about the emperor—such as the birth of a son. But Paul’s good news is not from the emperor but “of God”; it originated with Him. Its message that God will forgive sins, deliver from sin’s power, and give eternal hope ( 1:16 ; cf. 1Co 15:1–4 ) comes not only as a gracious offer, but also as a command to be obeyed ( 10:16 ). Paul was consumed with this message ( 1Co 9:23 )."

Better translated “righteousness from God.” A major theme of the book, appearing over 30 times in one form or another, righteousness is the state or condition of perfectly conforming to God’s perfect law and holy character. Other terms from the same Greek root also occur some 30 times and are usually translated “justified,” “justification” or similarly. Only God is inherently righteous ( Dt 32:4 ; Pss 11:7 ; 116:5 ; Jn 17:25 ; 1Jn 2:1 ; Rev 16:5 ), and man falls woefully short of the divine standard of moral perfection ( 3:10 , 23 ; Job 9:2 ; Mt 5:48 ). But the gospel reveals that on the basis of faith—and faith alone—God will impute His righteousness to ungodly sinners ( see notes on 3:21–24 ; 4:5 ; 2Co 5:21 ; Php 3:8–9 ). from faith to faith. This may be a parallel expression to “everyone who believes” ( 1:16 ), as if Paul were singling out the faith of each individual believer—from one person’s faith to another’s faith to another’s and so on. Or perhaps Paul’s point is that the righteousness from God is completely on the basis of faith from beginning to end. as it is written. See note on Hab 2:4 . But the righteous will live by faith . Paul intends to prove that it has always been God’s way to justify sinners by grace on the basis of faith alone. God established Abraham as a pattern of faith ( 4:22–25 ; Ga 3:6–7 ) and thus calls him the father of all who believe ( 4:11 , 16 ). Elsewhere, Paul uses this same phrase to argue that no one has ever been declared righteous before God except by faith alone ( Ga 3:11 ) and that true faith will demonstrate itself in action ( Php 2:12–13 ). This expression emphasizes that true faith is not a single event, but a way of life—it endures. That endurance is called the perseverance of the saints (cf. Col 1:22–23 ; Heb 3:12–14 ). One central theme of the story of Job is that no matter what Satan does, saving faith cannot be destroyed. See notes on 8:31–39 ."

This legal or forensic term comes from the Greek word for “righteous” and means “to declare righteous.” This verdict includes: pardon from the guilt and penalty of sin, and the imputation of Christ’s righteousness to the believer’s account, which provides for the positive righteousness man needs to be accepted by God. God declares a sinner righteous solely on the basis of the merits of Christ’s righteousness. God imputed a believer’s sin to Christ’s account in His sacrificial death ( Is 53:4–5 ; 1Pe 2:24 ), and He imputes Christ’s perfect obedience to God’s law to Christians (cf. 5:19 ; 1Co 1:30 ; see notes on 2Co 5:21 ; Php 3:9 ). The sinner receives this gift of God’s grace by faith alone ( 3:22 , 25 ; see notes on 4:1–25 ). Sanctification, the work of God by which He makes righteous those whom He has already justified, is distinct from justification but, without exception, always follows it ( 8:30 ). a gift by His grace.

The imagery behind this Greek word comes from the ancient slave market. It meant paying the necessary ransom to obtain the prisoner or slave’s release. The only adequate payment to redeem sinners from sin’s slavery and its deserved punishment was “in Christ Jesus” ( 1Ti 2:6 ; 1Pe 1:18–19 ), and was paid to God to satisfy His justice."

Sin must be able to exercise control in our bodies, or Paul’s admonition becomes unnecessary (v. 13 ). But sin does not have to reign there; so the apostle expresses his confidence that those who are Christ’s will not allow it to. not under law but under grace. This does not mean God has abrogated His moral law ( 3:31 ; cf. Mt 5:17–19 ). The law is good, holy, and righteous ( 7:12 ; cf. 1Ti 1:8 ), but it cannot be kept, so it curses. Since it cannot assist anyone to keep God’s moral standard (cf. 7:7–11 ), it can only show the standard and thus rebuke and condemn those who fail to keep it. But the believer is no longer under the law as a condition of acceptance with God—an impossible condition to meet and one designed only to show man his sinfulness ( see notes on 3:19–20 ; cf. Ga 3:10–13 )—but under grace, which enables him to truly fulfill the law’s righteous requirements ( 7:6 ; 8:3–4 ). Chapter 7 is Paul’s complete commentary on this crucial expression."

They point out that Paul describes the person as “sold … under sin” (v. 14 ); as having “nothing good” in him (v. 18 ); and as a “wretched man” trapped in a “body of death” (v. 24 ). Those descriptions seem to contradict the way Paul describes the believer in chap. 6 (cf. vv. 2 , 6–7 , 11 , 17–18 , 22 ). However, it is correct to understand Paul here to be speaking about a believer. This person desires to obey God’s law and hates his sin (vv. 15 , 19 , 21 ); he is humble, recognizing that nothing good dwells in his humanness (v. 18 ); he sees sin in himself, but not as all that is there (vv. 17 , 20–22 ); and he serves Jesus Christ with his mind (v. 25 ). Paul has already established that none of those attitudes ever describe the unsaved (cf. 1:18–21 , 32 ; 3:10–20 ). Paul’s use of present tense verbs in vv. 14–25 strongly supports the idea that he is describing his life currently as a Christian. For those reasons, it seems certain that chap. 7 describes a believer. However, of those who agree that this is a believer, there is still disagreement. Some see a carnal, fleshly Christian; others a legalistic Christian, frustrated by his feeble attempts in his own power to please God by keeping the Mosaic law. But the personal pronoun “I” refers to the apostle Paul, a standard of spiritual health and maturity. So, in vv. 14–25 Paul must be describing all Christians—even the most spiritual and mature—who, when they honestly evaluate themselves against the righteous standard of God’s law, realize how far short they fall. He does so in a series of 4 laments (vv. 14–17 , 18–20 , 21–23 , 24–25 )."

Dualism taught that the body is evil and the spirit is good, so its adherents sinned with impunity by claiming they were not responsible; their sin was entirely the product of their physical bodies, while their spirits remained untouched and unsullied.

The mature Gentiles understood that idols are not gods and, therefore, that they could eat meat that had been offered to them.
