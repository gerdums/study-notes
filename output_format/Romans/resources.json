    "content": "The Letter of Paul to the Romans Title This epistle’s name comes from its original recipients: the members of the church in Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire ( <a ref='Romans 1:7'>1:7</a> ). Author and Date No one disputes that the apostle Paul wrote Romans. Like his namesake, Israel’s first king (Saul was Paul’s Hebrew name; Paul his Greek name), Paul was from the tribe of Benjamin ( <a ref='Philippians 3:5'>Php 3:5</a> ). He was also a Roman citizen ( <a ref='Acts 16:37'>Ac 16:37</a> ; <a ref='Acts 22:25'>22:25</a> ). Paul was born about the time of Christ’s birth in Tarsus ( <a ref='Acts 9:11'>Ac 9:11</a> ), an important city ( <a ref='Acts 21:39'>Ac 21:39</a> ) in the Roman province of Cilicia, located in Asia Minor (modern Turkey). He spent much of his early life in Jerusalem as a student of the celebrated rabbi Gamaliel ( <a ref='Acts 22:3'>Ac 22:3</a> ). Like his father before him, Paul was a Pharisee ( <a ref='Acts 23:6'>Ac 23:6</a> ), a member of the strictest Jewish sect (cf. <a ref='Philippians 3:5'>Php 3:5</a> ). Miraculously converted while on his way to Damascus (ca. AD 33–34) to arrest Christians in that city, Paul immediately began proclaiming the gospel message ( <a ref='Acts 9:20'>Ac 9:20</a> ). After narrowly escaping from Damascus with his life ( <a ref='Acts 9:23–25'>Ac 9:23–25</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 11:32–33'>2Co 11:32–33</a> ), Paul spent 3 years in Nabatean Arabia, south and east of the Dead Sea ( <a ref='Galatians 1:17–18'>Ga 1:17–18</a> ). During that time, he received much of his doctrine as direct revelation from the Lord ( <a ref='Galatians 1:11–12'>Ga 1:11–12</a> ). More than any other individual, Paul was responsible for the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire. He made 3 missionary journeys through much of the Mediterranean world, tirelessly preaching the gospel he had once sought to destroy ( <a ref='Acts 26:9'>Ac 26:9</a> ). After he returned to Jerusalem bearing an offering for the needy in the church there, he was falsely accused by some Jews ( <a ref='Acts 21:27–29'>Ac 21:27–29</a> ), savagely beaten by an angry mob ( <a ref='Acts 21:30–31'>Ac 21:30–31</a> ), and arrested by the Romans. Though two Roman governors, Felix and Festus, as well as Herod Agrippa, did not find him guilty of any crime, pressure from the Jewish leaders kept Paul in Roman custody. After two years, the apostle exercised his right as a Roman citizen and appealed his case to Caesar. After a harrowing trip ( <a ref='Ac 27-28'>Ac 27–28</a> ), including a violent, two-week storm at sea that culminated in a shipwreck, Paul reached Rome. Eventually released for a brief period of ministry, he was arrested again and suffered martyrdom at Rome in ca. AD 65–67 (cf. <a ref='2 Timothy 4:6'>2Ti 4:6</a> ). Though physically unimpressive (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 10:10'>2Co 10:10</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 4:14'>Ga 4:14</a> ), Paul possessed an inner strength granted him through the Holy Spirit’s power ( <a ref='Philippians 4:13'>Php 4:13</a> ). The grace of God proved sufficient to provide for his every need ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 12:9–10'>2Co 12:9–10</a> ), enabling this noble servant of Christ to successfully finish his spiritual race ( <a ref='2 Timothy 4:7'>2Ti 4:7</a> ). Paul wrote Romans from Corinth, as the references to Phoebe ( <a ref='Romans 16:1'>Ro 16:1</a> , Cenchrea was Corinth’s port), Gaius ( <a ref='Romans 16:23'>Ro 16:23</a> ), and Erastus ( <a ref='Romans 16:23'>Ro 16:23</a> )—all of whom were associated with Corinth—indicate. The apostle wrote the letter toward the close of his third missionary journey (most likely in AD 56), as he prepared to leave for Israel with an offering for the poor believers in the Jerusalem church ( <a ref='Romans 15:25'>Ro 15:25</a> ). Phoebe was given the great responsibility of delivering this letter to the Roman believers ( <a ref='Romans 16:1–2'>16:1–2</a> ). Background and Setting Rome was the capital and most important city of the Roman Empire. It was founded in 753 BC, but is not mentioned in Scripture until NT times. Rome is located along the banks of the Tiber River, about 15 miles from the Mediterranean Sea. Until an artificial harbor was built at nearby Ostia, Rome’s main harbor was Puteoli, some 150 miles away ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 28:13'>Ac 28:13</a></i> ). In Paul’s day, the city had a population of over one million people, many of whom were slaves. Rome boasted magnificent buildings, such as the Emperor’s palace, the Circus Maximus, and the Forum, but its beauty was marred by the slums in which so many lived. According to tradition, Paul was martyred outside Rome on the Ostian Way during Nero’s reign (AD 54–68). Some of those converted on the Day of Pentecost probably founded the church at Rome (cf. <a ref='Acts 2:10'>Ac 2:10</a> ). Paul had long sought to visit the Roman church, but had been prevented from doing so ( <a ref='Romans 1:13'>1:13</a> ). In God’s providence, Paul’s inability to visit Rome gave the world this inspired masterpiece of gospel doctrine. Paul’s primary purpose in writing Romans was to teach the great truths of the gospel of grace to believers who had never received apostolic instruction. The letter also introduced him to a church where he was personally unknown, but hoped to visit soon for several important reasons: to edify the believers ( <a ref='Romans 1:11'>1:11</a> ); to preach the gospel ( <a ref='Romans 1:15'>1:15</a> ); and to get to know the Roman Christians, so they could encourage him ( <a ref='Romans 1:12'>1:12</a> ; <a ref='Romans 15:32'>15:32</a> ), better pray for him ( <a ref='Romans 15:30'>15:30</a> ), and help him with his planned ministry in Spain ( <a ref='Romans 15:28'>15:28</a> ). First Century Rome Unlike some of Paul’s other epistles (e.g., 1-2Co, Gal), his purpose for writing was not to correct aberrant theology or rebuke ungodly living. The Roman church was doctrinally sound, but, like all churches, it was in need of the rich doctrinal and practical instruction this letter provides. Historical and Theological Themes Since Romans is primarily a work of doctrine, it contains little historical material. Paul does use such familiar OT figures as Abraham (chap. <a ref='Ro 4'>4</a> ), David ( <a ref='Romans 4:6–8'>4:6–8</a> ), Adam ( <a ref='Romans 5:12–21'>5:12–21</a> ), Sarah ( <a ref='Romans 9:9'>9:9</a> ), Rebekah ( <a ref='Romans 9:10'>9:10</a> ), Jacob and Esau ( <a ref='Romans 9:10–13'>9:10–13</a> ), and Pharaoh ( <a ref='Romans 9:17'>9:17</a> ) as illustrations. He also recounts some of Israel’s history (chaps. <a ref='Ro 9-11'>9–11</a> ). Chapter <a ref='Ro 16'>16</a> provides insightful glimpses into the nature and character of the first-century church and its members. The overarching theme of Romans is the righteousness that comes from God: the glorious truth that God justifies guilty, condemned sinners by grace alone through faith in Christ alone. Chapters <a ref='Ro 1-11'>1–11</a> present the theological truths of that doctrine, while chaps. <a ref='Ro 12-16'>12–16</a> detail its practical outworking in the lives of individual believers and the life of the whole church. Some specific theological topics include principles of spiritual leadership ( <a ref='Romans 1:8–15'>1:8–15</a> ); God’s wrath against sinful mankind ( <a ref='Romans 1:18–32'>1:18–32</a> ); principles of divine judgment ( <a ref='Romans 2:1–16'>2:1–16</a> ); the universality of sin ( <a ref='Romans 3:9–20'>3:9–20</a> ); an exposition and defense of justification by faith alone ( <a ref='Romans 3:21–4:25'>3:21—4:25</a> ); the security of salvation ( <a ref='Romans 5:1–11'>5:1–11</a> ); the transference of Adam’s sin ( <a ref='Romans 5:12–21'>5:12–21</a> ); sanctification (chaps. <a ref='Ro 6-8'>6–8</a> ); sovereign election (chap. <a ref='Ro 9'>9</a> ); God’s plan for Israel (chap. <a ref='Ro 11'>11</a> ); spiritual gifts and practical godliness (chap. <a ref='Ro 12'>12</a> ); the believer’s responsibility to human government (chap. <a ref='Ro 13'>13</a> ); and principles of Christian liberty ( <a ref='Romans 14:1–15:12'>14:1—15:12</a> ). Interpretive Challenges As the preeminent doctrinal work in the NT, Romans naturally contains a number of difficult passages. Paul’s discussion of the perpetuation of Adam’s sin ( <a ref='Romans 5:12–21'>5:12–21</a> ) is one of the deepest, most profound theological passages in all of Scripture. The nature of mankind’s union with Adam, and how his sin was transferred to the human race has always been the subject of intense debate. Bible students also disagree on whether <a ref='Romans 7:7–25'>7:7–25</a> describes Paul’s experience as a believer or unbeliever, or is a literary device not intended to be autobiographical at all. The closely related doctrines of election ( <a ref='Romans 8:28–30'>8:28–30</a> ) and the sovereignty of God ( <a ref='Romans 9:6–29'>9:6–29</a> ) have confused many believers. Others question whether chaps. <a ref='Ro 9-11'>9–11</a> teach that God has a future plan for the nation of Israel. Some have ignored Paul’s teaching on the believer’s obedience to human government ( <a ref='Romans 13:1–7'>13:1–7</a> ) in the name of Christian activism, while others have used it to defend slavish obedience to totalitarian regimes. All of these and more interpretive challenges are addressed in the notes to the respective passages. Outline I. Greetings and Introduction ( <a ref='Romans 1:1–15'>1:1–15</a> ) II.

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Romans 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>Paul.</b> See Introduction: Author and Date . <b>slave.</b> <i>Doulos</i> , the common NT word for servant. Although in Greek culture it most often referred to the involuntary, permanent service of a slave, Paul elevates this word by using it in its Hebrew sense to describe a servant who willingly commits himself to serve a master he loves and respects ( <a ref='Exodus 21:5–6'>Ex 21:5–6</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 1:10'>Ga 1:10</a> ; <a ref='Titus 1:1'>Tit 1:1</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 26:24'>Ge 26:24</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 12:7'>Nu 12:7</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 7:5'>2Sa 7:5</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 53:11'>Is 53:11</a> ). <b>apostle.</b> The Greek word means “one who is sent.” In the NT, it primarily refers to the 12 men Christ chose to accompany Him ( <a ref='Mark 3:13–19'>Mk 3:13–19</a> ) and Matthias, whom the other apostles chose to replace Judas ( <a ref='Acts 1:15–26'>Ac 1:15–26</a> ). Christ gave them power to confirm their apostleship with miracles ( <a ref='Matthew 10:1'>Mt 10:1</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 12:12'>2Co 12:12</a> ), and authority to speak as His proxies—every NT book was written either by an apostle or under his auspices (cf. <a ref='John 14:26'>Jn 14:26</a> ). Their teaching is the foundation of the church ( <a ref='Ephesians 2:20'>Eph 2:20</a> ). Christ Himself selected Paul for this position ( <a ref='Acts 9:15'>Ac 9:15</a> ; <a ref='Acts 22:14'>22:14</a> ; <a ref='Acts 26:16'>26:16</a> ; cf. <a ref='Galatians 1:1'>Ga 1:1</a> ) and trained him to fulfill this ministry ( <a ref='Galatians 1:12'>Ga 1:12</a> , <a ref='Galatians 1:16'>16</a> ). <b>gospel of God.</b> Used in its verb and noun forms some 60 times in this epistle, the Greek word for this phrase means “good news” (see <a ref='Mark 1:1'>Mk 1:1</a> ). Rome incorporated it into its emperor worship. The town herald used this word to begin important favorable announcements about the emperor—such as the birth of a son. But Paul’s good news is not from the emperor but “of God”; it originated with Him. Its message that God will forgive sins, deliver from sin’s power, and give eternal hope ( <a ref='Romans 1:16'>1:16</a> ; cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:1–4'>1Co 15:1–4</a> ) comes not only as a gracious offer, but also as a command to be obeyed ( <a ref='Romans 10:16'>10:16</a> ). Paul was consumed with this message ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 9:23'>1Co 9:23</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>which He promised beforehand.</b> Paul’s Jewish antagonists accused him of preaching a revolutionary new message unrelated to Judaism ( <a ref='Acts 21:28'>Ac 21:28</a> ). But the OT is replete with prophecies concerning Christ and the gospel ( <a ref='1 Peter 1:10–12'>1Pe 1:10–12</a> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:17'>Mt 5:17</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 1:1'>Heb 1:1</a> ). <b>His prophets.</b> All the writers of the OT. The “Law and the Prophets” constitute all the OT ( <a ref='Acts 24:14'>Ac 24:14</a> ). But the law—or the Pentateuch—was written by Moses, whom Scripture also calls a prophet ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:15'>Dt 18:15</a> ). <b>holy Scriptures.</b> While the rabbinical writings popular in the first century—and often studied more diligently than Scripture itself—may not have taught the gospel of God, the divinely inspired OT certainly did (cf. <a ref='Luke 24:25'>Lk 24:25</a> , <a ref='Luke 24:27'>27</a> , <a ref='Luke 24:32'>32</a> ; <a ref='John 5:39'>Jn 5:39</a> ; <a ref='Acts 3:18'>Ac 3:18</a> ; <a ref='Acts 7:52'>7:52</a> ; <a ref='Acts 10:43'>10:43</a> ; <a ref='Acts 13:32'>13:32</a> ; <a ref='Acts 26:22–23'>26:22–23</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Genesis 3:15'>Ge 3:15</a></i> ). The prophets spoke clearly of a New Covenant ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer 31:31–34</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 36:25–27'>Eze 36:25–27</a> ; cf. <a ref='Hebrews 8:6–13'>Heb 8:6–13</a> ) and of the Messiah whose sacrifice would make it possible ( <a ref='Isaiah 9:6–7'>Is 9:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 53:1–12'>53:1–12</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>born.</b> Jesus was conceived in a virgin’s womb by the Holy Spirit ( <a ref='Luke 1:35'>Lk 1:35</a> ; cf. <a ref='Isaiah 7:14'>Is 7:14</a> ), and was delivered normally. This word emphasizes that He is an actual historical figure. Many well-known ancient writers, including the Roman historian Tacitus ( <i>Annals</i> 15.44), the familiar Jewish historian Josephus ( <i>Antiquities</i> , 2.18.3), and Pliny the Younger ( <i>Letters</i> 10.96,97) verify Jesus’ historicity. <b>the seed of David.</b> The OT had prophesied that Messiah would be in the lineage of David ( <a ref='2 Samuel 7:12–13'>2Sa 7:12–13</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:3–4'>Ps 89:3–4</a> , <a ref='Psalms 89:19'>19</a> , <a ref='Psalms 89:24'>24</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:1–5'>Is 11:1–5</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:5–6'>Jer 23:5–6</a> ). Both Mary, Jesus’ mother ( <a ref='Luke 3:23'>Lk 3:23</a> , <a ref='Luke 3:31'>31</a> ), and Joseph, His legal father ( <a ref='Matthew 1:6'>Mt 1:6</a> , <a ref='Matthew 1:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Luke 1:27'>Lk 1:27</a> ), were descendants of David. John makes believing that Christ has come in the flesh a crucial test of orthodoxy ( <a ref='1 John 4:2–3'>1Jn 4:2–3</a> ). Because He is fully human—as well as fully God—He can serve as man’s substitute ( <a ref='John 1:29'>Jn 1:29</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ) and as a sympathetic High Priest ( <a ref='Hebrews 4:15–16'>Heb 4:15–16</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>designated.</b> The Greek word, from which the English word “horizon” comes, means “to distinguish.” Just as the horizon serves as a clear demarcation line, dividing earth and sky, the resurrection of Jesus Christ clearly divides Him from the rest of humanity, providing irrefutable evidence that He is the Son of God ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 10:9'>10:9</a></i> ). <b>Son of God.</b> This title, used nearly 30 times in the Gospels, identifies Jesus Christ as the same in essence as God. <i>See notes on <a ref='John 1:34'>Jn 1:34</a> , <a ref='John 1:49'>49</a> ; <a ref='John 11:27'>11:27</a> ; <a ref='John 19:7'>19:7</a></i> (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 1:5'>Heb 1:5</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 7:14'>2Sa 7:14</a> ). The resurrection clearly declared that Jesus was deity, the expression of God Himself in human form. While He was eternally the Son in anticipation of His incarnation, it was when He entered the world in incarnation that He was declared to all the world as the Son of God and took on the role of submission to the Father ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Psalms 2:7'>Ps 2:7</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 1:5–6'>Heb 1:5–6</a></i> ). <b>resurrection from the dead.</b> His victory over death was the supreme demonstration and most conclusive evidence that He is God the Son ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 10:9'>10:9</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Acts 13:29–33'>Ac 13:29–33</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:14–17'>1Co 15:14–17</a> ). <b>Spirit of holiness.</b> In His incarnation, Christ voluntarily submitted Himself to do the will of the Father only through the direction, agency, and power of the Holy Spirit ( <a ref='Matthew 3:16'>Mt 3:16</a> ; <a ref='Luke 4:1'>Lk 4:1</a> ; <a ref='John 3:34'>Jn 3:34</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 1:2'>Ac 1:2</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>grace.</b> The unmerited favor which God shows guilty sinners. This is the book’s first reference to the most crucial part of the gospel message: salvation is a gift from God wholly separate from any human effort or achievement ( <a ref='Romans 3:24'>3:24</a> , <a ref='Romans 3:27'>27</a> ; <a ref='Romans 4:1–5'>4:1–5</a> ; <a ref='Romans 5:20–21'>5:20–21</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Ephesians 2:8'>Eph 2:8</a></i> ). <b>apostleship.</b> Although the term “apostle” refers to the 12 in a unique way ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 1:1'>1:1</a></i> ), in a broader and less official sense it can describe anyone whom God has sent with the message of salvation (cf. <a ref='Acts 14:14'>Ac 14:14</a> ; <a ref='Romans 16:7'>Ro 16:7</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 3:1'>Heb 3:1</a> ). <b>obedience of faith.</b> True saving faith always produces obedience and submission to the Lordship of Jesus Christ ( <a ref='Romans 16:19'>16:19</a> , <a ref='Romans 16:26'>26</a> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 10:9–10'>10:9–10</a> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 7:13–14'>Mt 7:13–14</a> , <a ref='Matthew 7:22–27'>22–27</a> ; <a ref='James 2:17–20'>Jas 2:17–20</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:6'>1:6</a> <b>called.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 1:7'>1:7</a> .</i> Always in the NT Epistles the “call” of God refers to God’s effectual call of elect sinners to salvation (cf. <a ref='Romans 8:28–30'>8:28–30</a> ), rather than the general call to all people to believe (cf. <a ref='Matthew 20:16'>Mt 20:16</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:7'>1:7</a> <b>beloved of God … called</b> as <b>saints.</b> The Greek text records these as 3 separate privileges: 1) God has set His love on His own ( <a ref='Romans 5:5'>5:5</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:35'>8:35</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:6'>Eph 1:6</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:4–5'>2:4–5</a> ; <a ref='1 John 3:1'>1Jn 3:1</a> ); 2) He has extended to them not only the general, external invitation to believe the gospel ( <a ref='Isaiah 45:22'>Is 45:22</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 55:6'>55:6</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 33:11'>Eze 33:11</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 11:28'>Mt 11:28</a> ; <a ref='John 7:37'>Jn 7:37</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 22:17'>Rev 22:17</a> ), but His effectual calling—or His drawing to Himself all those He has chosen for salvation ( <a ref='Romans 8:30'>8:30</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:13–14'>2Th 2:13–14</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 1:9'>2Ti 1:9</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='John 6:44'>Jn 6:44</a></i> ); and 3) God has set believers apart from sin unto Himself, so that they are holy ones ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:16–17'>1Co 3:16–17</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:5'>1Pe 2:5</a> , <a ref='1 Peter 2:9'>9</a> ). <b>Rome.</b> See Introduction: Background and Setting . <b>Grace … peace.</b> Paul’s standard greeting ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:3'>1Co 1:3</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 1:2'>2Co 1:2</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 1:3'>Ga 1:3</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:2'>Eph 1:2</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 1:2'>Php 1:2</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:2'>Col 1:2</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 1:1'>1Th 1:1</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:2'>2Th 1:2</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 1:2'>1Ti 1:2</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 1:2'>2Ti 1:2</a> ; <a ref='Titus 1:4'>Tit 1:4</a> ; <a ref='Philemon 1:3'>Phm 3</a> ). First-Century Rome Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Romans 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>I thank my God.</b> In every letter Paul wrote, he expressed his gratitude for those who would receive it (e.g., <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:4'>1Co 1:4</a> ), except in his letter to the Galatians, whose defection from the true gospel caused him to dispense with any opening commendations ( <a ref='Galatians 1:6–12'>Ga 1:6–12</a> ). <b>your faith.</b> The genuineness of their salvation. The testimony of the church in Rome was so strong that in AD 49 the emperor Claudius expelled all the Jews because of the influence of “Chrestus,” which was undoubtedly a reference to Christ (cf. <a ref='Acts 18:2'>Ac 18:2</a> ). <b>throughout the whole world.</b> As the center of the Roman Empire and the inhabited world, whatever happened in Rome became known universally. <a ref='Romans 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>serve in my spirit.</b> In the NT, this Greek word for “serve” always refers to religious service, and is sometimes translated “worship.” Paul had seen the shallow, hypocritical religion of the Pharisees and the superstitious hedonism of pagan idolatry. His spiritual service ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 12:1'>12:1</a></i> ), however, did not result from abject fear or legal obligation, but was genuine and sincere (cf. <a ref='Philippians 3:3'>Php 3:3</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 1:3'>2Ti 1:3</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 2:22'>2:22</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:10'>1:10</a> <b>in my prayers.</b> Paul frequently recorded the content of his requests ( <a ref='Ephesians 3:14–19'>Eph 3:14–19</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 1:9–11'>Php 1:9–11</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:9–11'>Col 1:9–11</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:11–12'>2Th 1:11–12</a> ) and urged his readers to join him in prayer ( <a ref='Romans 15:30–32'>15:30–32</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:17'>1Th 5:17</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 6:18'>Eph 6:18</a> ). <b>will of God.</b> God’s sovereign orchestration of Paul’s circumstances (cf. <a ref='Matthew 6:10'>Mt 6:10</a> ; <a ref='Acts 21:11–14'>Ac 21:11–14</a> ; <a ref='James 4:13–14'>Jas 4:13–14</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>spiritual gift.</b> The Greek word translated “gift” is <i>charisma</i> , which means a “gift of grace”—a spiritual enablement whose source is the Spirit of God. Romans uses this same term to describe: 1) Christ Himself ( <a ref='Romans 5:15–16'>5:15–16</a> ); 2) general blessings from God ( <a ref='Romans 11:29'>11:29</a> ; cf. <a ref='1 Timothy 6:17'>1Ti 6:17</a> ); and 3) specific spiritual gifts given to members of the body to minister to the whole ( <a ref='Romans 12:6–8'>12:6–8</a> ; cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:1–31'>1Co 12:1–31</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 4:10–11'>1Pe 4:10–11</a> ). Paul probably intends to encompass all 3. <a ref='Romans 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>by each other’s faith.</b> A glimpse of Paul’s genuine humility (cf. <a ref='1 Peter 5:3–4'>1Pe 5:3–4</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>fruit.</b> Scripture catalogs 3 kinds of spiritual fruit: 1) spiritual attitudes that characterize a Spirit-led believer ( <a ref='Galatians 5:22–23'>Ga 5:22–23</a> ); 2) righteous actions ( <a ref='Romans 6:22'>6:22</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 4:16–17'>Php 4:16–17</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 13:15'>Heb 13:15</a> ); and 3) new converts ( <a ref='Romans 16:5'>16:5</a> ). In this context, Paul is probably referring to the third one—a desire that was eventually realized during his imprisonment in Rome ( <a ref='Philippians 4:22'>Php 4:22</a> ). <b>among the rest of the Gentiles.</b> This implies the church in Rome consisted primarily of non-Jews. <a ref='Romans 1:14'>1:14</a> <b>under obligation.</b> Paul had an obligation to God (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 9:16–17'>1Co 9:16–17</a> ) to fulfill His divine mandate to minister to Gentiles ( <a ref='Romans 1:5'>1:5</a> ; <a ref='Acts 9:15'>Ac 9:15</a> ). <b>Greeks.</b> People of many different nationalities who had embraced the Greek language, culture, and education. They were the sophisticated elite of Paul’s day. Because of their deep interest in Greek philosophy, they were considered “wise.” Because of this prevalence of Greek culture, Paul sometimes used this word to describe all Gentiles (cf. <a ref='Romans 3:9'>3:9</a> ). <b>barbarians.</b> A derisive term coined by the Greeks for all who had not been trained in Greek language and culture. When someone spoke in another language, it sounded to the Greeks like “bar-bar-bar,” or unintelligible chatter. Although in the narrowest sense “barbarian” referred to the uncultured, uneducated masses, it was often used to describe all non-Greeks—the unwise of the world. Paul’s point is that God is no respecter of persons—the gospel must reach both the world’s elite and its outcasts (cf. <a ref='John 4:4–42'>Jn 4:4–42</a> ; <a ref='James 2:1–9'>Jas 2:1–9</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:15'>1:15</a> <b>gospel.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 1:1'>1:1</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 1:16–17'>1:16–17</a> These two verses crystallize the thesis of the entire book—the gospel of Jesus Christ—which Paul will unfold and explain in the following chapters. <a ref='Romans 1:16'>1:16</a> <b>I am not ashamed.</b> He had been imprisoned in Philippi ( <a ref='Acts 16:23–24'>Ac 16:23–24</a> ), chased out of Thessalonica ( <a ref='Acts 17:10'>Ac 17:10</a> ), smuggled out of Berea ( <a ref='Acts 17:14'>Ac 17:14</a> ), laughed at in Athens ( <a ref='Acts 17:32'>Ac 17:32</a> ), regarded as a fool in Corinth ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:18'>1Co 1:18</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:23'>23</a> ), and stoned in Galatia ( <a ref='Acts 14:19'>Ac 14:19</a> ), but Paul remained eager to preach the gospel in Rome—the seat of contemporary political power and pagan religion. Neither ridicule, criticism, nor physical persecution could curb his boldness. <i>See notes on <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:5–18'>2Co 4:5–18</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 11:23–28'>11:23–28</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 12:9–10'>12:9–10</a> .</i> <b>power.</b> The English word “dynamite” comes from this Greek word. Although the message may sound foolish to some ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:18'>1Co 1:18</a> ), the gospel is effective because it carries with it the omnipotence of God (cf. <a ref='Exodus 15:6'>Ex 15:6</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:39'>Dt 32:39</a> ; <a ref='Job 9:4'>Job 9:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 33:8–9'>Pss 33:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:13'>89:13</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 106:8–9'>106:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 26:4'>Is 26:4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 43:13'>43:13</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 10:12'>Jer 10:12</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 27:5'>27:5</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 28:18'>Mt 28:18</a> ; <a ref='Romans 9:21'>Ro 9:21</a> ). Only God’s power is able to overcome man’s sinful nature and give him new life ( <a ref='Romans 5:6'>5:6</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:3'>8:3</a> ; <a ref='John 1:12'>Jn 1:12</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:18'>1Co 1:18</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:23–25'>23–25</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:1–4'>2:1–4</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 4:20'>4:20</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:23'>1Pe 1:23</a> ). <b>salvation.</b> Used 5 times in Romans (the verb form occurs 8 times), this key word basically means “deliverance” or “rescue.” The power of the gospel delivers people from lostness ( <a ref='Matthew 18:11'>Mt 18:11</a> ), from the wrath of God ( <a ref='Romans 5:9'>Ro 5:9</a> ), from willful spiritual ignorance ( <a ref='Hosea 4:6'>Hos 4:6</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:8'>2Th 1:8</a> ), from evil self-indulgence ( <a ref='Luke 14:26'>Lk 14:26</a> ), and from the darkness of false religion ( <a ref='Colossians 1:13'>Col 1:13</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:9'>1Pe 2:9</a> ). It rescues them from the ultimate penalty of their sin, i.e., eternal separation from God and eternal punishment ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 20:6'>Rev 20:6</a></i> ). <b>believes.</b> To trust, rely on, or have faith in. When used of salvation, this word usually occurs in the present tense, which stresses that faith is not simply a onetime event, but an ongoing condition. True saving faith is supernatural, a gracious gift of God that He produces in the heart ( <i>see note on <a ref='Ephesians 2:8'>Eph 2:8</a></i> ) and is the only means by which a person can appropriate true righteousness (cf. <a ref='Romans 3:22'>3:22</a> , <a ref='Romans 3:25'>25</a> ; <a ref='Romans 4:5'>4:5</a> , <a ref='Romans 4:13'>13</a> , <a ref='Romans 4:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Romans 5:1'>5:1</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 4:1–25'>4:1–25</a></i> ). Saving faith consists of 3 elements: 1) mental: the mind understands the gospel and the truth about Christ ( <a ref='Romans 10:14–17'>10:14–17</a> ); 2) emotional: one embraces the truthfulness of those facts with sorrow over sin and joy over God’s mercy and grace ( <a ref='Romans 6:17'>6:17</a> ; <a ref='Romans 15:13'>15:13</a> ); and 3) volitional: the sinner submits his will to Christ and trusts in Him alone as the only hope of salvation ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 10:9'>10:9</a></i> ). Genuine faith will always produce authentic obedience ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 4:3'>4:3</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='John 8:31'>Jn 8:31</a> ; <a ref='John 14:21–24'>14:21–24</a> ). <b>Jew first.</b> God chose Israel to be His witness nation ( <a ref='Exodus 19:6'>Ex 19:6</a> ) and gave her distinct privileges ( <a ref='Romans 3:2'>3:2</a> ; <a ref='Romans 9:4–5'>9:4–5</a> ). Christ’s ministry was first to Israel ( <a ref='Matthew 15:24'>Mt 15:24</a> ), and it was through Israel that salvation was to come to the world ( <a ref='John 4:22'>Jn 4:22</a> ; <a ref='Acts 13:46'>Ac 13:46</a> ). <b>Greek.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 1:14'>1:14</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 1:17'>1:17</a> <b>righteousness of God.</b> Better translated “righteousness from God.” A major theme of the book, appearing over 30 times in one form or another, righteousness is the state or condition of perfectly conforming to God’s perfect law and holy character. Other terms from the same Greek root also occur some 30 times and are usually translated “justified,” “justification” or similarly. Only God is inherently righteous ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:4'>Dt 32:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 11:7'>Pss 11:7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 116:5'>116:5</a> ; <a ref='John 17:25'>Jn 17:25</a> ; <a ref='1 John 2:1'>1Jn 2:1</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:5'>Rev 16:5</a> ), and man falls woefully short of the divine standard of moral perfection ( <a ref='Romans 3:10'>3:10</a> , <a ref='Romans 3:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Job 9:2'>Job 9:2</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 5:48'>Mt 5:48</a> ). But the gospel reveals that on the basis of faith—and faith alone—God will impute His righteousness to ungodly sinners ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 3:21–24'>3:21–24</a> ; <a ref='Romans 4:5'>4:5</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:8–9'>Php 3:8–9</a></i> ). <b>from faith to faith.</b> This may be a parallel expression to “everyone who believes” ( <a ref='Romans 1:16'>1:16</a> ), as if Paul were singling out the faith of each individual believer—from one person’s faith to another’s faith to another’s and so on. Or perhaps Paul’s point is that the righteousness from God is completely on the basis of faith from beginning to end. <b>as it is written.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Habakkuk 2:4'>Hab 2:4</a> .</i> But the righteous will live by faith <b>.</b> Paul intends to prove that it has always been God’s way to justify sinners by grace on the basis of faith alone. God established Abraham as a pattern of faith ( <a ref='Romans 4:22–25'>4:22–25</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:6–7'>Ga 3:6–7</a> ) and thus calls him the father of all who believe ( <a ref='Romans 4:11'>4:11</a> , <a ref='Romans 4:16'>16</a> ). Elsewhere, Paul uses this same phrase to argue that no one has ever been declared righteous before God except by faith alone ( <a ref='Galatians 3:11'>Ga 3:11</a> ) and that true faith will demonstrate itself in action ( <a ref='Philippians 2:12–13'>Php 2:12–13</a> ). This expression emphasizes that true faith is not a single event, but a way of life—it endures. That endurance is called the perseverance of the saints (cf. <a ref='Colossians 1:22–23'>Col 1:22–23</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 3:12–14'>Heb 3:12–14</a> ). One central theme of the story of Job is that no matter what Satan does, saving faith cannot be destroyed. <i>See notes on <a ref='Romans 8:31–39'>8:31–39</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 1:18–3:20'>1:18—3:20</a> After introducing the righteousness which comes from God ( <a ref='Romans 1:17'>1:17</a> ), a theme he develops at length ( <a ref='Romans 3:21–5:21'>3:21—5:21</a> ), Paul presents the overwhelming evidence of man’s sinfulness, underscoring how desperately he needs this righteousness that only God can provide. He presents God’s case against the irreligious, immoral pagan ( <a ref='Romans 1:18–32'>1:18–32</a> ; the Gentiles) and the religious, outwardly moral person ( <a ref='Romans 2:1–3:8'>2:1—3:8</a> ; the Jews); and concludes by showing that all men alike deserve God’s judgment ( <a ref='Romans 3:9–20'>3:9–20</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:18'>1:18</a> <b>wrath of God.</b> This is not an impulsive outburst of anger aimed capriciously at people whom God does not like. It is the settled, determined response of a righteous God against sin (cf. <a ref='Psalms 2:5'>Pss 2:5</a> , <a ref='Psalms 2:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 45:7'>45:7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 75:8'>75:8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 76:6–7'>76:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 78:49–51'>78:49–51</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 90:7–9'>90:7–9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 51:17'>Is 51:17</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 25:15–16'>Jer 25:15–16</a> ; <a ref='John 3:36'>Jn 3:36</a> ; <a ref='Romans 9:22'>Ro 9:22</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:6'>Eph 5:6</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 3:5–6'>Col 3:5–6</a> ). <b>is revealed.</b> More accurately, “is constantly revealed.” The word essentially means “to uncover, make visible, or make known.” God reveals His wrath in two ways: 1) indirectly, through the natural consequences of violating His universal moral law, and 2) directly through His personal intervention (the OT record—from the sentence passed on Adam and Eve to the worldwide flood, from the fire and brimstone that leveled Sodom to the Babylonian captivity—clearly displays this kind of intervention). The most graphic revelation of God’s holy wrath and hatred against sin was when He poured out divine judgment on His Son on the cross. God has various kinds of wrath: 1) eternal wrath, which is hell; 2) eschatological wrath, which is the final day of the Lord; 3) cataclysmic wrath like the Flood and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah; 4) consequential wrath, which is the principle of sowing and reaping; and 5) the wrath of abandonment, which is removing restraint and letting people go to their sins (for examples of this wrath, see <a ref='Psalms 81:11–12'>Ps 81:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 1:23–31'>Pr 1:23–31</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Hosea 4:17'>Hos 4:17</a></i> ). Here, it is that fifth form, God’s abandoning the wicked continually through history to pursue their sin and its consequences (vv. <a ref='Romans 1:24–32'>24–32</a> ). <b>ungodliness.</b> This indicates a lack of reverence for, devotion to, and worship of the true God—a defective relationship with Him (cf. <a ref='Jude 1:14–15'>Jd 14–15</a> ). <b>unrighteousness.</b> This refers to the result of ungodliness: a lack of conformity in thought, word, and deed to the character and law of God ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 1:17'>1:17</a></i> ). <b>suppress the truth.</b> Although the evidence from conscience ( <a ref='Romans 1:19'>1:19</a> ; <a ref='Romans 2:14'>2:14</a> ), creation ( <a ref='Romans 1:20'>1:20</a> ), and God’s Word is irrefutable, men choose to resist and oppose God’s truth by holding fast to their sin (cf. <a ref='Psalms 14:1'>Ps 14:1</a> ; <a ref='John 3:19–20'>Jn 3:19–20</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:19'>1:19</a> <b>is evident within them.</b> God has sovereignly planted evidence of His existence in the very nature of man by reason and moral law ( <a ref='Romans 1:20–21'>1:20–21</a> , <a ref='Romans 1:28'>28</a> , <a ref='Romans 1:32'>32</a> ; <a ref='Romans 2:15'>2:15</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:20'>1:20</a> <b>invisible attributes.</b> This refers specifically to the two mentioned in this verse. <b>His eternal power.</b> The Creator, who made all that we see around us and constantly sustains it, must be a being of awesome power. <b>divine nature.</b> That is, His faithfulness ( <a ref='Genesis 8:21–22'>Ge 8:21–22</a> ), kindness, and graciousness ( <a ref='Acts 14:17'>Ac 14:17</a> ). <b>through what has been made.</b> The creation delivers a clear, unmistakable message about God’s person (cf. <a ref='Psalms 19:1–8'>Pss 19:1–8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 94:9'>94:9</a> ; <a ref='Acts 14:15–17'>Ac 14:15–17</a> ; <a ref='Acts 17:23–28'>17:23–28</a> ). <b>they are without excuse.</b> God holds all men responsible for their refusal to acknowledge what He has shown them of Himself in His creation. Even those who have never had an opportunity to hear the gospel have received a clear witness about the existence and character of God—and have suppressed it. <a ref='Romans 1:21'>1:21</a> <b>knew God.</b> Man is conscious of God’s existence, power, and divine nature through general revelation (vv. <a ref='Romans 1:19–20'>19–20</a> ). <b>they did not glorify Him.</b> Man’s chief end is to glorify God ( <a ref='Leviticus 10:3'>Lv 10:3</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 16:24–29'>1Chr 16:24–29</a> ; <a ref='Ps 148'>Ps 148</a> ; <a ref='Romans 15:5–6'>Ro 15:5–6</a> ), and Scripture constantly demands it ( <a ref='Psalms 29:1–2'>Ps 29:1–2</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:31'>1Co 10:31</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 4:11'>Rev 4:11</a> ). To glorify Him is to honor Him, to acknowledge His attributes, and to praise Him for His perfections (cf. <a ref='Exodus 34:5–7'>Ex 34:5–7</a> ). It is to recognize His glory and extol Him for it. Failing to give Him glory is man’s greatest affront to his Creator ( <a ref='Acts 12:22–23'>Ac 12:22–23</a> ). <b>or give thanks.</b> They refused to acknowledge that every good thing they enjoyed came from God ( <a ref='Matthew 5:45'>Mt 5:45</a> ; <a ref='Acts 14:15–17'>Ac 14:15–17</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 6:17'>1Ti 6:17</a> ; <a ref='James 1:17'>Jas 1:17</a> ). <b>futile.</b> Man’s search for meaning and purpose will produce only vain, meaningless conclusions. <b>heart was darkened.</b> When man rejects the truth, the darkness of spiritual falsehood replaces it (cf. <a ref='John 3:19–20'>Jn 3:19–20</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:22'>1:22</a> <b>Professing to be wise, they became fools.</b> Man rationalizes his sin and proves his utter foolishness by devising and believing his own philosophies about God, the universe, and himself (cf. <a ref='Psalms 14:1'>Pss 14:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 53:1'>53:1</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:23'>1:23</a> <b>exchanged the glory … for an image.</b> They substitute the worship of idols for the worship of the true God. Historians report that many ancient cultures did not originally have idols. For example, Persia (Herodotus; <i>The Histories</i> , 1:31), Rome (Varro in Augustine; <i>The City of God</i> , 4:31), even Greece and Egypt (Lucian; <i>The Syrian Goddess</i> , 34) had no idolatry at their founding. The fourth-century AD historian Eusebius reported that the oldest civilizations had no idols. The earliest biblical record of idolatry was among Abram’s family in Ur ( <a ref='Joshua 24:2'>Jos 24:2</a> ). The first commandment forbids it ( <a ref='Exodus 20:3–5'>Ex 20:3–5</a> ), and the prophets continually ridiculed those who foolishly practiced it ( <a ref='Isaiah 44:9–17'>Is 44:9–17</a> ; cf. <a ref='2 Kings 17:13–16'>2Ki 17:13–16</a> ). Although the false gods which men worship do not exist, demons often impersonate them ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:20'>1Co 10:20</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:24–32'>1:24–32</a> This section describes the downward spiral of the wrath of abandonment ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 1:18'>18</a></i> ) in the life of man when God abandons him. Paul shows the essence (vv. <a ref='Romans 1:24–25'>24–25</a> ), the expression (vv. <a ref='Romans 1:26–27'>26–27</a> ), and the extent (vv. <a ref='Romans 1:28–32'>28–32</a> ) of man’s sinfulness. <a ref='Romans 1:24'>1:24</a> <b>God gave them over.</b> This is a judicial term in Greek, used for handing over a prisoner to his sentence. When men consistently abandon God, He will abandon them (cf. <a ref='Judges 10:13'>Jdg 10:13</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 15:2'>2Chr 15:2</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 24:20'>24:20</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 81:11–12'>Ps 81:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 4:17'>Hos 4:17</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 15:14'>Mt 15:14</a> ; <a ref='Acts 7:38–42'>Ac 7:38–42</a> ; <a ref='Acts 14:16'>14:16</a> ). He accomplishes this 1) indirectly and immediately, by removing His restraint and allowing their sin to run its inevitable course, and 2) directly and eventually, by specific acts of divine judgment and punishment. <b>impurity.</b> A general term often used of decaying matter, like the contents of a grave. It speaks here of sexual immorality ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 12:21'>2Co 12:21</a> ; cf. <a ref='Galatians 5:19–23'>Ga 5:19–23</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:3'>Eph 5:3</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:7'>1Th 4:7</a> ), which begins in the heart and moves to the shame of the body. <a ref='Romans 1:25'>1:25</a> <b>a lie.</b> A denial of God’s existence and His right to be obeyed and glorified (vv. <a ref='Romans 1:19–21'>19–21</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 44:20'>Is 44:20</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 13:25'>Jer 13:25</a> ; cf. <a ref='John 8:44'>Jn 8:44</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:26'>1:26</a> <b>God gave them over.</b> <i>See notes on vv. <a ref='Romans 1:18'>18</a> , <a ref='Romans 1:24'>24</a> .</i> <b>dishonorable passions.</b> Identified in vv. <a ref='Romans 1:26–27'>26–27</a> as homosexuality, a sin roundly condemned in Scripture ( <a ref='Ge 19'>Ge 19</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 18:22'>Lv 18:22</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:9–11'>1Co 6:9–11</a> ; cf. <a ref='Galatians 5:19–21'>Ga 5:19–21</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:3–5'>Eph 5:3–5</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 1:9–10'>1Ti 1:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Jude 1:7'>Jd 7</a> ). <b>females.</b> Rather than the normal Greek term for women, this is a general word for female. Paul mentions women first to show the extent of debauchery under the wrath of abandonment, because in most cultures women are the last to be affected by moral collapse. <a ref='Romans 1:27'>1:27</a> <b>receiving in their own persons the due penalty.</b> Here the law of sowing and reaping ( <a ref='Galatians 6:7–8'>Ga 6:7–8</a> ) takes effect, as Paul refers to the self-destructive nature of this sin, of which AIDS is one frightening evidence. <a ref='Romans 1:28'>1:28</a> <b>God gave them over.</b> <i>See notes on vv. <a ref='Romans 1:18'>18</a> , <a ref='Romans 1:24'>24</a> .</i> <b>unfit.</b> This translates a Greek word that means “not passing the test.” It was often used to describe useless, worthless metals, discarded because they contained too much impurity. God has tested man’s minds and found them worthless and useless (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 6:30'>Jer 6:30</a> ). <a ref='Romans 1:32'>1:32</a> <b>know.</b> Not ignorance, but blatant rebellion ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 2:15'>2:15</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 2:1–16'>2:1–16</a> Having demonstrated the sinfulness of the immoral pagan ( <a ref='Romans 1:18–32'>1:18–32</a> ), Paul presents his case against the religious moralist—Jew or Gentile—by cataloging 6 principles that govern God’s judgment: 1) knowledge (v. <a ref='Romans 2:1'>1</a> ); 2) truth (vv. <a ref='Romans 2:2–3'>2–3</a> ); 3) guilt (vv. <a ref='Romans 2:4–5'>4–5</a> ); 4) deeds (vv. <a ref='Romans 2:6–10'>6–10</a> ); 5) impartiality (vv. <a ref='Romans 2:11–15'>11–15</a> ); and 6) motive (v. <a ref='Romans 2:16'>16</a> ). <a ref='Romans 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>no excuse … everyone who passes judgment.</b> Both Jews (Paul’s primary audience here; cf. v. <a ref='Romans 2:17'>17</a> ) and moral Gentiles who think they are exempt from God’s judgment because they have not indulged in the immoral excesses described in chap. <a ref='Ro 1'>1</a> are tragically mistaken. They have more knowledge than the immoral pagan ( <a ref='Romans 3:2'>3:2</a> ; <a ref='Romans 9:4'>9:4</a> ) and thus a greater accountability (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 10:26–29'>Heb 10:26–29</a> ; <a ref='James 3:1'>Jas 3:1</a> ). <b>condemn yourself.</b> If someone has sufficient knowledge to judge others, he condemns himself, because he shows he has the knowledge to evaluate his own condition. <b>practice the same things.</b> In their condemnation of others they have excused and overlooked their own sins. Self-righteousness exists because of two deadly errors: 1) minimizing God’s moral standard usually by emphasizing externals; and 2) underestimating the depth of one’s own sinfulness (cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:20–22'>Mt 5:20–22</a> , <a ref='Matthew 5:27–28'>27–28</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 7:1–3'>7:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 15:1–3'>15:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:21'>Lk 18:21</a> ). <a ref='Romans 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>rightly falls.</b> Whatever God does is by nature right (cf. <a ref='Romans 3:4'>3:4</a> ; <a ref='Romans 9:14'>9:14</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 9:4'>Pss 9:4</a> , <a ref='Psalms 9:8'>8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 96:13'>96:13</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 145:17'>145:17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 45:19'>Is 45:19</a> ). <a ref='Romans 2:3'>2:3</a> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Romans 2:1'>1</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 2:4'>2:4</a> <b>think lightly.</b> Lit. “to think down on,” thus to underestimate someone’s or something’s value, and even to treat with contempt. <b>kindness.</b> This refers to “common grace,” the benefits God bestows on all men (cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:45'>Mt 5:45</a> ; <a ref='Acts 14:15–17'>Ac 14:15–17</a> ). <b>forbearance.</b> This word, which means “to hold back,” was sometimes used of a truce between warring parties. Rather than destroying every person the moment he or she sins, God graciously holds back His judgment (cf. <a ref='Romans 3:25'>3:25</a> ). He saves sinners in a physical and temporal way from what they deserve ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 Timothy 4:10'>1Ti 4:10</a></i> ), to show them His saving character, that they might come to Him and receive salvation that is spiritual and eternal. <b>patience.</b> This word indicates the duration for which God demonstrates His kindness and tolerance—for long periods of time (cf. <a ref='2 Peter 2:5'>2Pe 2:5</a> ). Together these 3 words speak of God’s common grace—the way He demonstrates His grace to all mankind (cf. <a ref='Job 12:10'>Job 12:10</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 119:68'>Pss 119:68</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 145:9'>145:9</a> ). <b>repentance.</b> The act of turning from sin to Christ for forgiveness and salvation. <i>See notes on <a ref='2 Corinthians 7:9–11'>2Co 7:9–11</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 2:5'>2:5</a> <b>stubbornness.</b> The English word “sclerosis” (as in arteriosclerosis, a hardening of the arteries) comes from this Greek word. But here the danger is not physical, but spiritual hardness ( <a ref='Ezekiel 36:26'>Eze 36:26</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 19:8'>Mt 19:8</a> ; <a ref='Mark 3:5'>Mk 3:5</a> ; <a ref='Mark 6:52'>6:52</a> ; <a ref='Mark 8:17'>8:17</a> ; <a ref='John 12:40'>Jn 12:40</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 3:8'>Heb 3:8</a> , <a ref='Hebrews 3:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 4:7'>4:7</a> ). <b>unrepentant heart.</b> A refusal to repent (cf. v. <a ref='Romans 2:4'>4</a> ) and accept God’s pardon of sin through Jesus Christ. <b>storing up wrath.</b> To reject God’s offer of forgiveness and cling to one’s sin is to accumulate more of God’s wrath and earn a severer judgment ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Hebrews 10:26–30'>Heb 10:26–30</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:12'>Rev 20:12</a></i> ). <b>day of wrath and … judgment.</b> Refers to the final judgment of wicked men that comes at the Great White Throne at the end of the Millennium ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Revelation 20:11–15'>Rev 20:11–15</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 2:6–10'>2:6–10</a> <i>See notes on vv. <a ref='Romans 2:1–16'>1–16</a> .</i> Although Scripture everywhere teaches that salvation is not on the basis of works ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 4:1–4'>4:1–4</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:8'>Eph 2:8</a></i> ), it consistently teaches that God’s judgment is always on the basis of a person’s deeds ( <a ref='Isaiah 3:10–11'>Is 3:10–11</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 17:10'>Jer 17:10</a> ; <a ref='John 5:28–29'>Jn 5:28–29</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:8'>1Co 3:8</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:10'>2Co 5:10</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 6:7–9'>Ga 6:7–9</a> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 14:12'>Ro 14:12</a> ). Paul describes the deeds of two distinct groups: the redeemed (vv. <a ref='Romans 2:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Romans 2:10'>10</a> ) and the unredeemed (vv. <a ref='Romans 2:8–9'>8–9</a> ). The deeds of the redeemed are not the basis of their salvation but the evidence of it. They are not perfect and are prone to sin, but there is undeniable evidence of righteousness in their lives ( <i>see notes on <a ref='James 2:14–20'>Jas 2:14–20</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>eternal life.</b> Not simply in duration, because even unbelievers will live forever ( <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:9'>2Th 1:9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:9–11'>Rev 14:9–11</a> ), but also in quality ( <i>see note on <a ref='John 17:3'>Jn 17:3</a></i> ).

Israel will receive severer punishment because she was given greater light and blessing (see <a ref='Romans 9:3–4'>9:3–4</a> ). <a ref='Romans 2:11'>2:11</a> <b>partiality.</b> Lit. “to receive a face,” that is, to give consideration to someone simply because of his position, wealth, influence, popularity, or appearance. Because it is God’s nature to be just, it is impossible for Him to be anything but impartial ( <a ref='Acts 10:34'>Ac 10:34</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 2:6'>Ga 2:6</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 6:7–8'>Eph 6:7–8</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 3:25'>Col 3:25</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:17'>1Pe 1:17</a> ). <a ref='Romans 2:12'>2:12</a> <b>sinned without the Law.</b> The Gentiles who never had the opportunity to know God’s moral law ( <a ref='Exodus 20:1'>Ex 20:1ff.</a> ) will be judged on their disobedience in relationship to their limited knowledge ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 1:19–20'>1:19–20</a></i> ). <b>judged by the Law.</b> The Jews and many Gentiles who had access to God’s moral law will be accountable for their greater knowledge (cf. <a ref='Matthew 11:20–23'>Mt 11:20–23</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 6:4–6'>Heb 6:4–6</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:26–31'>10:26–31</a> ). <a ref='Romans 2:13'>2:13</a> <b>will be justified.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 3:24'>3:24</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='James 2:20–26'>Jas 2:20–26</a> . <a ref='Romans 2:14'>2:14</a> <b>naturally do the things of the Law.</b> Without knowing the written law of God, people in pagan society generally value and attempt to practice its most basic tenets.

In addition to an innate awareness of God’s law, men have a warning system that activates when they choose to ignore or disobey that law.

From the time of the Babylonian captivity, the whole race bore this title. Their great heritage, however (cf. <a ref='Genesis 12:3'>Ge 12:3</a> ), became a source of pride and complacency (cf. <a ref='Jonah 4:2'>Jon 4:2</a> ; <a ref='Micah 3:11–12'>Mic 3:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 3:7–9'>Mt 3:7–9</a> ; <a ref='John 8:31–34'>Jn 8:31–34</a> , <a ref='John 8:40–59'>40–59</a> ), which led to judgment instead of “praise.” <a ref='Romans 2:19–20'>2:19–20</a> <b>the blind … immature.</b> Because they possessed the law, the Jews were confident that they were spiritually superior teachers: guides to blind pagans (cf. <a ref='Matthew 23:24–28'>Mt 23:24–28</a> ), light (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 42:6'>Is 42:6</a> ), wise in God’s ways, and able to teach the immature (probably a reference to Gentile proselytes to Judaism). <a ref='Romans 2:21–23'>2:21–23</a> A series of questions designed to contrast most Jews’ practice with what they knew and taught (cf. <a ref='Psalms 50:16–20'>Ps 50:16–20</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 23:3–4'>Mt 23:3–4</a> ; <a ref='James 3:1'>Jas 3:1</a> ). <a ref='Romans 2:22'>2:22</a> <b>do you rob temples?</b> May refer to fraudulently skimming funds from money given to the temple or withholding part of their temple tax or offerings (cf. <a ref='Malachi 3:8–10'>Mal 3:8–10</a> ).

Here Paul uses the word to encompass the entire OT—the Jews received the very words of the true God ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:1–2'>Dt 4:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:1–2'>6:1–2</a> ; cf. <a ref='Mark 12:24'>Mk 12:24</a> ; <a ref='Luke 16:29'>Lk 16:29</a> ; <a ref='John 5:39'>Jn 5:39</a> ). The Jews had a great advantage in having the OT, because it contained the truth about salvation ( <a ref='2 Timothy 3:15'>2Ti 3:15</a> ) and about the gospel in its basic form ( <a ref='Galatians 3:8'>Ga 3:8</a> ). When Paul said “preach the word” ( <a ref='2 Timothy 4:2'>2Ti 4:2</a> ), he meant the “oracles (or utterances) of God” ( <a ref='1 Peter 4:11'>1Pe 4:11</a> ) recorded in Scripture. <a ref='Romans 3:3–4'>3:3–4</a> Paul anticipated that Jewish readers would disagree with his statements that God has not guaranteed to fulfill His promises to every physical descendant of Abraham. They would argue that such teaching nullifies all the promises God made to the Jews in the OT. But his answer reflects both the explicit and implicit teaching of the OT; before any Jew, regardless of the purity of his lineage, can inherit the promises, he must come to repentance and faith (cf. <a ref='Romans 9:6–7'>9:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 55:6–7'>Is 55:6–7</a> ). <a ref='Romans 3:3'>3:3</a> <b>the faithfulness of God.</b> God will fulfill all the promises He made to the nation, even if individual Jews are not able to receive them because of their unbelief. <a ref='Romans 3:4'>3:4</a> <b>every man. … liar.</b> If all mankind were to agree that God had been unfaithful to His promises, it would only prove that all are liars and God is true.

Christ’s death as a substitute pays the penalty exacted on those who failed to keep God’s law, and His perfect obedience to every requirement of God’s law fulfills God’s demand for comprehensive righteousness ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:24'>1Pe 2:24</a> ; cf. <a ref='Hebrews 9:28'>Heb 9:28</a> ); and 3) because God’s righteousness is eternal ( <a ref='Psalms 119:142'>Ps 119:142</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 51:8'>Is 51:8</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:24'>Da 9:24</a> ), the one who receives it from Him enjoys it forever. <b>witnessed by the Law and the Prophets.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 1:2'>1:2</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 3:22'>3:22</a> <b>through faith … all … who believe.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 1:16'>1:16</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 3:22–23'>3:22–23</a> <b>there is no distinction … glory of God.</b> A parenthetical comment explaining that God can bestow His righteousness on all who believe, Jew or Gentile, because all people—without distinction—fail miserably to live up to the divine standard. <a ref='Romans 3:23'>3:23</a> <b>all have sinned.</b> Paul has already made this case ( <a ref='Romans 1:18–3:20'>1:18—3:20</a> ). <a ref='Romans 3:24'>3:24</a> <b>justified.</b> This verb, and related words from the same Greek root (e.g., justification), occur some 30 times in Romans and are concentrated in <a ref='Romans 2:13–5:1'>2:13—5:1</a> . This legal or forensic term comes from the Greek word for “righteous” and means “to declare righteous.” This verdict includes: pardon from the guilt and penalty of sin, and the imputation of Christ’s righteousness to the believer’s account, which provides for the positive righteousness man needs to be accepted by God. God declares a sinner righteous solely on the basis of the merits of Christ’s righteousness. God imputed a believer’s sin to Christ’s account in His sacrificial death ( <a ref='Isaiah 53:4–5'>Is 53:4–5</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:24'>1Pe 2:24</a> ), and He imputes Christ’s perfect obedience to God’s law to Christians (cf. <a ref='Romans 5:19'>5:19</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:30'>1Co 1:30</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:9'>Php 3:9</a></i> ). The sinner receives this gift of God’s grace by faith alone ( <a ref='Romans 3:22'>3:22</a> , <a ref='Romans 3:25'>25</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 4:1–25'>4:1–25</a></i> ). Sanctification, the work of God by which He makes righteous those whom He has already justified, is distinct from justification but, without exception, always follows it ( <a ref='Romans 8:30'>8:30</a> ). <b>a gift by His grace.</b> Justification is a gracious gift God extends to the repentant, believing sinner, wholly apart from human merit or work ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 1:5'>1:5</a></i> ). <b>redemption.</b> The imagery behind this Greek word comes from the ancient slave market. It meant paying the necessary ransom to obtain the prisoner or slave’s release. The only adequate payment to redeem sinners from sin’s slavery and its deserved punishment was “in Christ Jesus” ( <a ref='1 Timothy 2:6'>1Ti 2:6</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:18–19'>1Pe 1:18–19</a> ), and was paid to God to satisfy His justice. <a ref='Romans 3:25'>3:25</a> <b>whom God displayed.</b> This great sacrifice was not accomplished in secret, but God publicly displayed His Son on Calvary for all to see. <b>propitiation.</b> Crucial to the significance of Christ’s sacrifice, this word carries the idea of appeasement or satisfaction—in this case Christ’s violent death satisfied the offended holiness and wrath of God against those for whom Christ died ( <a ref='Isaiah 53:11'>Is 53:11</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:11–14'>Col 2:11–14</a> ). The Hebrew equivalent of this word was used to describe the mercy seat—the cover to the ark of the covenant—where the High Priest sprinkled the blood of the slaughtered animal on the Day of Atonement to make atonement for the sins of the people. In pagan religions, it is the worshiper, not the god, who is responsible to appease the wrath of the offended deity. But in reality, man is incapable of satisfying God’s justice apart from Christ, except by spending eternity in hell.

God’s justice demands that every sin and sinner be punished. God would have been just, when Adam and Eve sinned, to destroy them, and with them, the entire human race. But in His goodness and forbearance (see <a ref='Romans 2:4'>2:4</a> ), He withheld His judgment for a certain period of time (cf. <a ref='Psalms 78:38–39'>Ps 78:38–39</a> ; <a ref='Acts 17:30–31'>Ac 17:30–31</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 3:9'>2Pe 3:9</a> ). <a ref='Romans 3:26'>3:26</a> <b>demonstration of His righteousness.</b> Through the incarnation, sinless life, and substitutionary death of Christ. <b>just and the justifier.</b> The wisdom of God’s plan allowed Him to punish Jesus in the place of sinners and thereby justify those who are guilty without compromising His justice. <a ref='Romans 3:27'>3:27</a> <b>Where then is boasting?</b> Cf. <a ref='Romans 4:1–2'>4:1–2</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:26–29'>1Co 1:26–29</a> . <a ref='Romans 3:28'>3:28</a> <b>justified by faith.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Romans 3:24'>24</a> .</i> Paul’s clear meaning is that a person is justified on the basis of faith alone (cf. <a ref='Romans 4:3–5'>4:3–5</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='James 2:21'>Jas 2:21</a></i> ). <b>works of the Law.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Romans 3:20'>20</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 3:29'>3:29</a> God <b>of Gentiles.</b> There is only one true God (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 8:5–6'>1Co 8:5–6</a> ). <a ref='Romans 3:31'>3:31</a> Knowing he would be accused of antinomianism (being against the law) for arguing that a man was justified apart from keeping the law, Paul introduced here the defense he later developed in chaps. <a ref='Ro 6-7'>6–7</a> . <b>through faith … we establish the Law.</b> Salvation by grace through faith does not denigrate the law, but underscores its true importance: 1) by providing a payment for the penalty of death, which the law required for failing to keep it; 2) by fulfilling the law’s original purpose, which is to serve as a tutor to show mankind’s utter inability to obey God’s righteous demands and to drive people to Christ ( <a ref='Galatians 3:24'>Ga 3:24</a> ); and 3) by giving believers the capacity to obey it ( <a ref='Romans 8:3–4'>8:3–4</a> ). <a ref='Romans 4:1'>4:1</a> <b>Abraham, our forefather.</b> Paul uses the model of Abraham to prove justification by faith alone because the Jews held him up as the supreme example of a righteous man ( <a ref='John 8:39'>Jn 8:39</a> ), and because it clearly showed that Judaism with its works-righteousness had deviated from the faith of the Jews’ patriarchal ancestors. In a spiritual sense, Abraham was the forerunner of the primarily Gentile church in Rome as well ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 1:13'>1:13</a> ; <a ref='Romans 4:11'>4:11</a> , <a ref='Romans 4:16'>16</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Galatians 3:6–7'>Ga 3:6–7</a> ). <a ref='Romans 4:2'>4:2</a> <b>justified by works.</b> Declared righteous on the basis of human effort ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 3:24'>3:24</a></i> ). <b>boast.</b> If Abraham’s own works had been the basis of his justification, he would have had every right to boast in God’s presence.

Used in both financial and legal settings, this Greek word, which occurs 9 times in chap. <a ref='Ro 4'>4</a> alone, means to take something that belongs to someone and credit it to another’s account. It is a one-sided transaction—Abraham did nothing to accumulate it; God simply credited it to him. God took His own righteousness and credited it to Abraham as if it were actually his. This God did because Abraham believed in Him ( <i>see note on <a ref='Genesis 15:6'>Ge 15:6</a></i> ). righteousness <b>.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Romans 1:17'>1:17</a> ; <a ref='Romans 3:21'>3:21</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 4:4–5'>4:4–5</a> Broadening his argument from Abraham to all men, the apostle here makes it clear that the forensic act of declaring a person righteous is completely apart from any kind of human work. If salvation were on the basis of one’s own effort, God would owe salvation as a debt—but salvation is always a sovereignly given gift of God’s grace ( <a ref='Romans 3:24'>3:24</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:8–9'>Eph 2:8–9</a> ) to those who believe (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:16'>1:16</a> ).

In spite of the enormity of his sin and the utter absence of personal merit, David knew the blessing of imputed righteousness. <a ref='Romans 4:9–12'>4:9–12</a> Paul anticipated what his Jewish readers would be thinking: if Abraham was justified by his faith alone, why did God command him and his descendants to be circumcised?

Those whom He justifies, He will conform to the image of His Son ( <a ref='Romans 8:29–30'>8:29–30</a> ). <a ref='Romans 4:18–25'>4:18–25</a> Having shown that justification is through faith not works (vv. <a ref='Romans 4:1–8'>1–8</a> ), and that it is by grace, not the keeping of law (vv. <a ref='Romans 4:9–17'>9–17</a> ), Paul now concludes by showing that it results from divine power, not human effort (vv. <a ref='Romans 4:18–25'>18–25</a> ). <a ref='Romans 4:18'>4:18</a> <b>hope against hope.</b> From the human perspective, it seemed impossible (cf. v. <a ref='Romans 4:19'>19</a> ).

If Abraham was justified by faith, then all others are justified on the same basis. <a ref='Romans 4:25'>4:25</a> A paraphrase of the LXX (Greek translation of the OT) rendering of <a ref='Isaiah 53:12'>Is 53:12</a> . Perhaps these words were adapted to and quoted from an early Christian confession or hymn. <b>delivered over.</b> I.e., crucified. <b>on account of our justification.</b> The resurrection provided proof that God had accepted the sacrifice of His Son and would be able to be just and yet justify the ungodly. <a ref='Romans 5:1–11'>5:1–11</a> Paul completed his case that God justifies sinners on the basis of faith alone, and he turned his pen to counter the notion that although believers receive salvation by faith, they will preserve it by good works. He argues that they are bound eternally to Jesus Christ, preserved by His power and not by human effort (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:5'>Is 11:5</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 36:5'>Ps 36:5</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 3:23'>Lam 3:23</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:18–20'>Eph 1:18–20</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 2:13'>2Ti 2:13</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:23'>Heb 10:23</a> ). For the Christian, the evidences of that eternal tie are: 1) his peace with God (v. <a ref='Romans 5:1'>1</a> ); 2) his standing in grace (v. <a ref='Romans 5:2'>2a</a> ); 3) his hope of glory (vv. <a ref='Romans 5:2–5'>2b–5a</a> ); 4) his receiving of divine love (vv. <a ref='Romans 5:5–8'>5b–8</a> ); 5) his certain escape of divine wrath (vv. <a ref='Romans 5:9–10'>9–10</a> ); and 6) his joy in the Lord (v. <a ref='Romans 5:11'>11</a> ). <a ref='Romans 5:1'>5:1</a> <b>having been justified.</b> The Greek construction—and its English translation—underscores that justification is a onetime legal declaration with continuing results ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 3:24'>3:24</a></i> ), not an ongoing process. <b>peace with God.</b> Not a subjective, internal sense of calm and serenity, but an external, objective reality. God has declared Himself to be at war with every human being because of man’s sinful rebellion against Him and His laws (v. <a ref='Romans 5:10'>10</a> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 1:18'>1:18</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:7'>8:7</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 22:24'>Ex 22:24</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:21–22'>Dt 32:21–22</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 7:11'>Ps 7:11</a> ; <a ref='John 3:36'>Jn 3:36</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:6'>Eph 5:6</a> ). But the first great result of justification is that the sinner’s war with God is ended forever ( <a ref='Colossians 1:21–22'>Col 1:21–22</a> ). Scripture refers to the end of this conflict as a person’s being reconciled to God (vv. <a ref='Romans 5:10–11'>10–11</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:18–20'>2Co 5:18–20</a> ). <a ref='Romans 5:2'>5:2</a> <b>obtained our introduction.</b> This refers to the believer’s access to God through Jesus Christ. What was unthinkable to the OT Jew (cf. <a ref='Exodus 19:9'>Ex 19:9</a> , <a ref='Exodus 19:20–21'>20–21</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 28:35'>28:35</a> ) is now available to all who come ( <a ref='Jeremiah 32:38'>Jer 32:38</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 32:40'>40</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 4:16'>Heb 4:16</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:19–22'>10:19–22</a> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 27:51'>Mt 27:51</a> ). <b>stand.</b> This refers to the permanent, secure position believers enjoy in God’s grace (cf. v. <a ref='Romans 5:10'>10</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:31–34'>8:31–34</a> ; <a ref='John 6:37'>Jn 6:37</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 1:6'>Php 1:6</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 1:12'>2Ti 1:12</a> ; <a ref='Jude 1:24'>Jd 24</a> ). <b>hope of the glory of God.</b> Unlike the English word “hope,” the NT word contains no uncertainty; it speaks of something that is certain, but not yet realized. The believer’s ultimate destiny is to share in the very glory of God ( <a ref='Romans 8:29–30'>8:29–30</a> ; <a ref='John 17:22'>Jn 17:22</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 3:18'>2Co 3:18</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:20–21'>Php 3:20–21</a> ; <a ref='1 John 3:1–2'>1Jn 3:1–2</a> ), and that hope will be realized because Christ Himself secures it ( <a ref='1 Timothy 1:1'>1Ti 1:1</a> ). Without the clear and certain promises of the Word of God, the believer would have no basis for hope ( <a ref='Romans 15:4'>15:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 119:81'>Ps 119:81</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:114'>114</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:12'>Eph 2:12</a> ; cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 14:8'>Jer 14:8</a> ). <a ref='Romans 5:3'>5:3</a> <b>afflictions.</b> A word used for pressure, like that of a press squeezing the fluid from olives or grapes. Here they are not the normal pressures of living (cf. <a ref='Romans 8:35'>8:35</a> ), but the inevitable troubles that come to followers of Christ because of their relationship with Him ( <a ref='Matthew 5:10–12'>Mt 5:10–12</a> ; <a ref='John 15:20'>Jn 15:20</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:17'>2Co 4:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 3:3'>1Th 3:3</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 3:12'>2Ti 3:12</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 4:19'>1Pe 4:19</a> ). Such difficulties produce rich spiritual benefits (vv. <a ref='Romans 5:3–4'>3–4</a> ). <b>perseverance.</b> Sometimes translated “patience,” this word refers to endurance, the ability to remain under tremendous weight and pressure without succumbing ( <a ref='Romans 15:5'>15:5</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:22–23'>Col 1:22–23</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:4'>2Th 1:4</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:12'>Rev 14:12</a> ). <a ref='Romans 5:4'>5:4</a> <b>proven character.</b> The Greek word simply means “proof.” It was used of testing metals to determine their purity. Here the proof is Christian character (cf. <a ref='James 1:12'>Jas 1:12</a> ). Christians can glory in tribulations because of what those troubles produce. <a ref='Romans 5:5'>5:5</a> <b>love of God … poured out.</b> God’s love for us (cf. v. <a ref='Romans 5:8'>8</a> ) has been lavishly poured out to the point of overflowing within our hearts. Paul moves from the objective aspects of our security in Christ to the internal, more subjective. God has implanted within our hearts evidence that we belong to Him in that we love the One who first loved us ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 16:22'>1Co 16:22</a> ; cf. <a ref='Galatians 5:22'>Ga 5:22</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 3:14–19'>Eph 3:14–19</a> ; <a ref='1 John 4:7–10'>1Jn 4:7–10</a> ). <b>Spirit who was given.</b> A marvelous testimony to God’s love for us ( <a ref='Romans 8:9'>8:9</a> , <a ref='Romans 8:14'>14</a> , <a ref='Romans 8:16–17'>16–17</a> ; <a ref='John 7:38–39'>Jn 7:38–39</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:19–20'>1Co 6:19–20</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:13'>12:13</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:18'>Eph 1:18</a> ). <a ref='Romans 5:6'>5:6</a> <b>weak.</b> Unregenerate sinners are spiritually dead and incapable of doing anything to help themselves ( <a ref='John 6:44'>Jn 6:44</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:1'>Eph 2:1</a> ). <b>at the right time.</b> At the moment God had chosen (cf. <a ref='Galatians 4:4'>Ga 4:4</a> ). <b>Christ died for the ungodly.</b> God’s love for His own is unwavering because it is not based on how lovable we are, but on the constancy of His own character; God’s supreme act of love came when we were at our most undesirable (cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:46'>Mt 5:46</a> ). <a ref='Romans 5:7'>5:7</a> <b>righteous man … good man.</b> As uncommon as such a sacrifice is, Paul’s point is that we were neither of these persons—yet Christ sacrificed Himself for us. <a ref='Romans 5:9'>5:9</a> <b>Much more.</b> What Paul is about to say is even more amazing and wonderful. <b>justified.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 3:24'>3:24</a> .</i> <b>by His blood.</b> Through His violent, substitutionary death. References to the blood of the Savior include the reality that He bled in His death (a necessity to fulfill the OT imagery of sacrifice), but are not limited to the fluid itself. NT writers also use the term “blood” as a graphic way to describe violent death (see <a ref='Matthew 23:30'>Mt 23:30</a> , <a ref='Matthew 23:35'>35</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 27:4–8'>27:4–8</a> , <a ref='Matthew 27:24–25'>24–25</a> ; <a ref='John 6:53–56'>Jn 6:53–56</a> ; <a ref='Acts 5:28'>Ac 5:28</a> ; <a ref='Acts 20:26'>20:26</a> ). References to the Savior’s blood are not simply pointing to the fluid, but at His death and entire atoning work (cf. <a ref='Romans 3:25'>3:25</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:7'>Eph 1:7</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:13'>2:13</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:14'>Col 1:14</a> , <a ref='Colossians 1:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:12'>Heb 9:12</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:19'>10:19</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 13:12'>13:12</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:2'>1Pe 1:2</a> , <a ref='1 Peter 1:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='1 John 1:7'>1Jn 1:7</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 1:5'>Rev 1:5</a> ). <b>wrath.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 1:18'>1:18</a> .</i> Christ bore the full fury of God’s wrath in the believing sinner’s place, and there is none left for him (see <a ref='Romans 8:1'>8:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 1:10'>1Th 1:10</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:9'>5:9</a> ). <a ref='Romans 5:10'>5:10</a> <b>saved by His life.</b> When we were God’s enemies, Christ was able by His death to reconcile us to God. Certainly now that we are God’s children, the Savior can keep us by His living power. <a ref='Romans 5:11'>5:11</a> <b>reconciliation.</b> This is between God and sinners. <i>See notes on <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:18–20'>2Co 5:18–20</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 5:12–21'>5:12–21</a> In one of the most enigmatic passages in the entire book, Paul sets out to show how one man’s death can provide salvation for many. To prove his point, he uses Adam to establish the principle that one man’s actions can—and did—inexorably affect many other people. <a ref='Romans 5:12'>5:12</a> <b>just as … sin entered.</b> Not a particular sin, but the inherent propensity to sin entered the human realm; men became sinners by nature. Adam passed to all his descendants the inherent sinful nature he possessed because of his first disobedience. That nature is present from the moment of conception ( <a ref='Psalms 51:5'>Ps 51:5</a> ), making it impossible for man to live in a way that pleases God. Satan, the father of sin ( <a ref='1 John 3:8'>1Jn 3:8</a> ), first brought temptation to Adam and Eve ( <a ref='Genesis 3:1–7'>Ge 3:1–7</a> ). <b>through one man.</b> God appointed Adam to be the representative of the entire human race that descended from him. When Adam sinned, all mankind sinned—that is, God imputed the guilt of his sin to all Adam’s offspring (v. <a ref='Romans 5:18'>18</a> ; cf. <a ref='Hebrews 7:7–10'>Heb 7:7–10</a> ). <b>death.</b> Adam was not originally subject to death, but through his sin it became a grim certainty for him and his posterity. Death has three distinct manifestations: 1) spiritual death or separation from God (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 2:1–2'>Eph 2:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 4:18'>4:18</a> ); 2) physical death ( <a ref='Hebrews 9:27'>Heb 9:27</a> ); and 3) eternal death (also called the second death), which includes not only eternal separation from God, but also eternal torment in the lake of fire ( <a ref='Revelation 20:11–15'>Rev 20:11–15</a> ). <b>because all sinned.</b> All humanity first sinned in Adam. He was the head and representative of the whole human race, and that’s why his sin, not Eve’s, is the reason for our fallenness. Our own sin proves our willing complicity with Adam in rebellion against God. Some object to the concept of imputed guilt. But if God’s imputation of the guilt of Adam’s sin to us were not true, it would be impossible to argue that God can impute to us the righteousness of Christ (cf. <a ref='Romans 5:15–19'>5:15–19</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:22'>1Co 15:22</a> ). <a ref='Romans 5:13'>5:13</a> <b>sin is not imputed.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:19'>2Co 5:19</a> .</i> Though all men were regarded as sinners (v. <a ref='Romans 5:12'>12</a> ), because there was no explicit list of commands, there was no strict accounting of their specific points of violation. <b>when there is no law.</b> The period from Adam to Moses, when God had not yet given the Mosaic law. <a ref='Romans 5:14'>5:14</a> <b>Nevertheless death reigned.</b> But even without the law, death was universal. All men from Adam to Moses were subject to death, not because of their sinful acts against the Mosaic law (which they did not yet have), but because of their own inherited sinful nature. <b>not sinned … likeness … of Adam.</b> Those who had no specific revelation as did Adam ( <a ref='Genesis 2:16–17'>Ge 2:16–17</a> ) or those who had the Mosaic law (cf. v. <a ref='Romans 5:13'>13</a> ), but nevertheless sinned against the holiness of God, i.e., those who “sinned without the Law” ( <a ref='Romans 2:12'>2:12</a> ). <b>a type of Him … to come.</b> Both Adam and Christ were similar in that their acts affected many others. This phrase serves as transition from the apostle’s discussion of the transference of Adam’s sin to the crediting of Christ’s righteousness. <a ref='Romans 5:15–21'>5:15–21</a> In this passage Paul explores the contrasts between the condemning act of Adam and the redemptive act of Christ. They were different in their effectiveness (v. <a ref='Romans 5:15'>15</a> ), their extent (v. <a ref='Romans 5:16'>16</a> ), their efficacy (v. <a ref='Romans 5:17'>17</a> ), their essence (vv. <a ref='Romans 5:18–19'>18–19</a> ), and their energy (vv. <a ref='Romans 5:20–21'>20–21</a> ). <a ref='Romans 5:15'>5:15</a> <b>many died.</b> Paul uses the word “many” with two distinct meanings in v. <a ref='Romans 5:15'>15</a> , just as he will with the word “all” in v. <a ref='Romans 5:18'>18</a> . He has already established that all men, without exception, bear the guilt of sin and are therefore subject to death ( <i>see notes on v. <a ref='Romans 5:12'>12</a></i> ). So the “many” who die must refer to all Adam’s descendants. <b>much more.</b> Christ’s one act of redemption was immeasurably greater than Adam’s one act of condemnation. <a ref='Romans 5:16'>5:16</a> <b>the gift.</b> Salvation by grace. <b>the judgment</b> arose <b>from one</b> transgression. <i>See notes on v. <a ref='Romans 5:12'>12</a> .</i> <b>condemnation.</b> The divine guilty verdict; the opposite of justification. <b>many transgressions.</b> Adam brought upon all men the condemnation for only one offense—his willful act of disobedience.

Rather, like the word “many” in v. <a ref='Romans 5:15'>15</a> , Paul is using “all” with two different meanings for the sake of parallelism, a common practice in the Hebrew OT. <a ref='Romans 5:19'>5:19</a> <b>appointed righteous.</b> This expression probably refers to one’s legal status before God and not an actual change in character, since Paul is contrasting justification and condemnation throughout this passage, and he has not yet introduced the doctrine of sanctification (chaps. <a ref='Ro 6-8'>6–8</a> ) which deals with the actual transformation of the sinner as a result of redemption. <a ref='Romans 5:20'>5:20</a> <b>the Law came in.</b> Cf. <a ref='Galatians 3:19'>Ga 3:19</a> . Although the Mosaic law is not flawed ( <a ref='Romans 7:12'>7:12</a> ), its presence caused man’s sin to increase (cf. <a ref='Romans 7:8–11'>7:8–11</a> ). Thus it made men more aware of their own sinfulness and inability to keep God’s perfect standard ( <a ref='Romans 7:7'>7:7</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:21–22'>Ga 3:21–22</a> ), and it served as a tutor to drive them to Christ ( <a ref='Galatians 3:24'>Ga 3:24</a> ). <a ref='Romans 5:21'>5:21</a> This is the final summary of the analogy of Adam and Christ. <a ref='Romans 6:1–8:39'>6:1—8:39</a> Paul moves from demonstrating the doctrine of justification, which is God’s declaring the believing sinner righteous ( <a ref='Romans 3:20–5:21'>3:20—5:21</a> ), to demonstrating the practical ramifications of salvation on those who have been justified. He specifically discusses the doctrine of sanctification, which is God’s producing actual righteousness in the believer ( <a ref='Romans 6:1–8:39'>6:1—8:39</a> ). <a ref='Romans 6:1–10'>6:1–10</a> He begins his lesson on sanctification by arguing that in spite of their past, all whom God has justified will experience personal holiness (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:9–11'>1Co 6:9–11a</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 1:12–13'>1Ti 1:12–13</a> ). <a ref='Romans 6:1'>6:1</a> <b>Are we to continue in sin…?</b> Because of his past Pharisaic experience, Paul was able to anticipate the major objections of his critics. He had already alluded to this criticism, that by preaching a justification based solely on the free grace of God, he was encouraging people to sin (cf. <a ref='Romans 3:5–6'>3:5–6</a> , <a ref='Romans 3:8'>8</a> ). <a ref='Romans 6:2'>6:2</a> <b>May it never be!</b> Used 14 times in Paul’s epistles (10 in Romans: <a ref='Romans 3:4'>3:4</a> , <a ref='Romans 3:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Romans 3:31'>31</a> ; <a ref='Romans 6:2'>6:2</a> , <a ref='Romans 6:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Romans 7:7'>7:7</a> , <a ref='Romans 7:13'>13</a> ; <a ref='Romans 9:14'>9:14</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:1'>11:1</a> , <a ref='Romans 11:11'>11</a> ), this expression is the strongest Greek idiom for repudiating a statement, and it contains a sense of outrage that anyone would ever think the statement was true. <b>we … died to sin.</b> Not a reference to the believer’s ongoing daily struggle with sin, but to a onetime event completed in the past. Because we are “in Christ” ( <a ref='Romans 6:11'>6:11</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:1'>8:1</a> ), and He died in our place ( <a ref='Romans 5:6–8'>5:6–8</a> ), we are counted dead with Him. This is the fundamental premise of chap. <a ref='Ro 6'>6</a> , and Paul spends the remainder of the chapter explaining and supporting it. <a ref='Romans 6:3'>6:3</a> <b>baptized into Christ Jesus.</b> This does not refer to water baptism. Paul is actually using the word “baptized” in a metaphorical sense, as we might in saying someone was immersed in his work, or underwent his baptism of fire when experiencing some trouble. All Christians have, by placing saving faith in Him, been spiritually immersed into the person of Christ, that is, united and identified with Him (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:17'>1Co 6:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:2'>10:2</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:27'>Ga 3:27</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 3:21'>1Pe 3:21</a> ; <a ref='1 John 1:3'>1Jn 1:3</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 2:38'>Ac 2:38</a></i> ). Certainly water baptism pictures this reality, which is the purpose—to show the transformation of the justified. <b>into His death.</b> This means that immersion or identification is specifically with Christ’s death and resurrection, as the apostle will explain (see <a ref='Romans 6:4–7'>6:4–7</a> ). <a ref='Romans 6:4'>6:4</a> <b>buried with Him.</b> Since we are united by faith with Him, as baptism symbolizes, His death and burial become ours. <b>newness of life.</b> This is true if, in Christ, we died and were buried with Him, we have also been united with Him in His resurrection. There is a new quality and character to our lives, a new principle of life. This speaks of the believer’s regeneration (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:26'>Eze 36:26</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:17'>2Co 5:17</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 6:15'>Ga 6:15</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 4:24'>Eph 4:24</a> ). Whereas sin describes the old life, righteousness describes the new. <a ref='Romans 6:6'>6:6</a> <b>our old man.</b> A believer’s unregenerate self. The Greek word for “old” does not refer to something old in years but to something that is worn out and useless. Our old self died with Christ, and the life we now enjoy is a new divinely given life that is the life of Christ Himself (cf. <a ref='Galatians 2:20'>Ga 2:20</a> ). We have been removed from the unregenerate self’s presence and control, so we should not follow the remaining memories of its old sinful ways as if we were still under its evil influence ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Ephesians 4:20–24'>Eph 4:20–24</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 5:24'>Ga 5:24</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 3:9–10'>Col 3:9–10</a></i> ). <b>body of sin.</b> Essentially synonymous with “our old man.” Paul uses the terms “body” and “flesh” to refer to sinful propensities that are intertwined with physical weaknesses and pleasures (e.g., <a ref='Romans 8:10–11'>8:10–11</a> , <a ref='Romans 8:13'>13</a> , <a ref='Romans 8:23'>23</a> ). Although the old self is dead, sin retains a foothold in our temporal flesh or our unredeemed humanness, with its corrupted desires ( <a ref='Romans 7:14–24'>7:14–24</a> ). The believer does not have two competing natures, the old and the new; but one new nature that is still incarcerated in unredeemed flesh ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 6:12'>12</a></i> ). But the term “flesh” is not equivalent to the physical body, which can be an instrument of holiness (v. <a ref='Romans 6:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Romans 12:1'>12:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:20'>1Co 6:20</a> ). <b>done away with.</b> Rendered powerless or inoperative. <a ref='Romans 6:7'>6:7</a> <b>has died.</b> Through his union with Christ ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 6:3'>3</a></i> ). <b>justified from sin.</b> No longer under its domination and control. <a ref='Romans 6:8'>6:8</a> <b>we shall also live with Him.</b> The context suggests that Paul means not only that believers will live in the presence of Christ for eternity, but also that all who have died with Christ, which is true of all believers, will live a life here that is fully consistent with His holiness. <a ref='Romans 6:9'>6:9</a> <b>master.</b> Control or domination. Cf. vv. <a ref='Romans 6:11–12'>11–12</a> . <a ref='Romans 6:10'>6:10</a> <b>He died to sin.</b> Christ died to sin in two senses: 1) in regard to sin’s penalty—He met its legal demands upon the sinner; and 2) in regard to sin’s power—forever breaking its power over those who belong to Him. And His death will never need repeating ( <a ref='Hebrews 7:26–27'>Heb 7:26–27</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:12'>9:12</a> , <a ref='Hebrews 9:28'>28</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:10'>10:10</a> ; cf. <a ref='1 Peter 3:18'>1Pe 3:18</a> ). Paul’s point is that believers have died to sin in the same way. <b>He lives to God.</b> For God’s glory. <a ref='Romans 6:11–14'>6:11–14</a> Paul addresses the logical conclusion of his readers: if the old self is dead, why is there continually a struggle with sin, and how can the new self become dominant (see also <a ref='Romans 7:1–25'>7:1–25</a> )? His exhortation is contained in 2 key words: “consider” (vv. <a ref='Romans 6:11–12'>11b–12</a> ) and “present” (vv. <a ref='Romans 6:13–14'>13–14</a> ). <a ref='Romans 6:11'>6:11</a> <b>Even so.</b> This implies the importance of his readers’ knowing what he just explained. Without that foundation, what he is about to teach will not make sense. Scripture always identifies knowledge as the foundation for one’s practice (cf. <a ref='Colossians 3:10'>Col 3:10</a> ). <b>consider.</b> This word was often used metaphorically to refer to having an absolute, unreserved confidence in what one’s mind knows to be true—the kind of heartfelt confidence that affects his actions and decisions. Paul is not referring to mind games in which we trick ourselves into thinking a certain way. Rather, he is urging us to embrace by faith what God has revealed to be true. <b>dead to sin.</b> See vv. <a ref='Romans 6:2–7'>2–7</a> . <b>in Christ.</b> Paul’s favorite expression of our union with Christ. This is its first occurrence in Romans (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 1:3–14'>Eph 1:3–14</a> ). <a ref='Romans 6:12'>6:12</a> <b>mortal body.</b> The only remaining repository where sin finds the believer vulnerable. The brain and its thinking processes are part of the body and thus tempt our souls with its sinful lusts ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 6:6'>6</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 8:22–23'>8:22–23</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:53'>1Co 15:53</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:9–11'>1Pe 2:9–11</a> ). <a ref='Romans 6:13'>6:13</a> <b>presenting.</b> Refers to a decision of the will. Before sin can have power over a believer, it must first pass through his will (cf. <a ref='Philippians 2:12–13'>Php 2:12–13</a> ). <b>members.</b> The parts of the physical body, the headquarters from which sin operates in the believer ( <a ref='Romans 7:18'>7:18</a> , <a ref='Romans 7:22–25'>22–25</a> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 12:1'>12:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 9:27'>1Co 9:27</a> ). <b>instruments of unrighteousness.</b> Tools for accomplishing that which violates God’s holy will and law. <a ref='Romans 6:14'>6:14</a> <b>sin shall not be master over you.</b> Sin must be able to exercise control in our bodies, or Paul’s admonition becomes unnecessary (v. <a ref='Romans 6:13'>13</a> ). But sin does not have to reign there; so the apostle expresses his confidence that those who are Christ’s will not allow it to. <b>not under law but under grace.</b> This does not mean God has abrogated His moral law ( <a ref='Romans 3:31'>3:31</a> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:17–19'>Mt 5:17–19</a> ). The law is good, holy, and righteous ( <a ref='Romans 7:12'>7:12</a> ; cf. <a ref='1 Timothy 1:8'>1Ti 1:8</a> ), but it cannot be kept, so it curses. Since it cannot assist anyone to keep God’s moral standard (cf. <a ref='Romans 7:7–11'>7:7–11</a> ), it can only show the standard and thus rebuke and condemn those who fail to keep it. But the believer is no longer under the law as a condition of acceptance with God—an impossible condition to meet and one designed only to show man his sinfulness ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 3:19–20'>3:19–20</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Galatians 3:10–13'>Ga 3:10–13</a> )—but under grace, which enables him to truly fulfill the law’s righteous requirements ( <a ref='Romans 7:6'>7:6</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:3–4'>8:3–4</a> ). Chapter <a ref='Ro 7'>7</a> is Paul’s complete commentary on this crucial expression. <a ref='Romans 6:15–23'>6:15–23</a> This section continues Paul’s discussion of sanctification by reminding his readers of their past slavery to sin and their new slavery to righteousness. He wants them to live in submission to their new master, Jesus Christ, and not to be entangled again with the sins that characterized their old life, sins which no longer have any claim over them. <a ref='Romans 6:15'>6:15</a> <b>Shall we sin…?</b> Cf. <a ref='Romans 3:5–6'>3:5–6</a> , <a ref='Romans 3:8'>8</a> ; <a ref='Romans 6:1'>6:1</a> . <b>not under law but under grace.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Romans 6:14'>14</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 6:17'>6:17</a> <b>pattern of teaching … given over.</b> In the Gk. “pattern” is a word for a mold such as a craftsman would use to cast molten metal. Paul’s point is that God pours His new children into the mold of divine truth ( <a ref='Romans 12:2'>12:2</a> ; cf. <a ref='Titus 2:1'>Tit 2:1</a> ). New believers have an innate and compelling desire to know and obey God’s Word ( <a ref='1 Peter 2:2'>1Pe 2:2</a> ). <a ref='Romans 6:18'>6:18</a> <b>having been freed.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Romans 6:2'>2</a> .</i> <b>slaves of righteousness.</b> See v. <a ref='Romans 6:16'>16</a> . <a ref='Romans 6:19'>6:19</a> <b>human terms … weakness of your flesh.</b> Paul’s use of the master/slave analogy was an accommodation to their humanness and their difficulty in grasping divine truth. <b>your members.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Romans 6:13'>13</a> .</i> further <b>lawlessness.</b> Like a vicious animal, sin’s appetite only grows when it is fed ( <a ref='Genesis 4:7'>Ge 4:7</a> ). <a ref='Romans 6:22'>6:22</a> <b>freed from sin.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Romans 6:2'>2</a> .</i> <b>enslaved to God.</b> Paul describes a <i>doulos/</i> slave salvation relationship to one’s <i>kurios/</i> Lord who redeemed him. The <i>doulos</i> word group (used over 160 times in the NT) should always be translated with the sense of “slave” and never “servant” or “bond servant,” which would be foreign to the first-century intent of <i>doulos</i> , which conveyed at least five comprehensive ideas: 1) absolute obedience ( <a ref='Matthew 8:5–9'>Mt 8:5–9</a> ; <a ref='Luke 7:2–10'>Lk 7:2–10</a> ); 2) compulsory obedience ( <a ref='Luke 6:46'>Lk 6:46</a> ); 3) consistent obedience ( <a ref='John 13:16'>Jn 13:16</a> ); 4) exclusive obedience ( <a ref='Matthew 6:24'>Mt 6:24</a> ); and 5) loyal obedience ( <a ref='Matthew 10:24'>Mt 10:24</a> ; <a ref='John 15:20'>Jn 15:20</a> ). <i>Doulos</i> is always employed in the context of being owned by, belonging to, and being wholly subordinate to one’s master. Christ is the supreme example of both slave ( <a ref='Philippians 2:7'>Php 2:7</a> ) and Lord ( <a ref='Philippians 2:11'>Php 2:11</a> ). The lordship of Christ in authentic salvation (both inauguration and continuation) comes across clearly in texts such as <a ref='Romans 10:9'>Ro 10:9</a> (see note) and <a ref='Colossians 2:6'>Col 2:6</a> . The Savior possesses sovereign authority over those whom He has saved; the redeemed by virtue of their salvation are obliged to obey as those who have been bought with a price and therefore are not their own ( <a ref='Acts 20:28'>Ac 20:28</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 16:19–20'>1Co 16:19–20</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:17–19'>1Pe 1:17–19</a> ). <b>sanctification.</b> The benefit of being slaves to God is sanctification, the outcome of which is eternal life. <a ref='Romans 6:23'>6:23</a> This verse describes two inexorable absolutes: 1) spiritual death is the paycheck for every man’s slavery to sin; and 2) eternal life is a free gift God gives undeserving sinners who believe in His Son (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 2:8–9'>Eph 2:8–9</a> ). <a ref='Romans 7:1–8:4'>7:1—8:4</a> Knowing that his readers—especially Jewish ones—would have many questions about how the law relates to their faith in Christ, Paul sets out to explain that relationship (he refers to the law 27 times in this passage). In a detailed explanation of what it means not to be under law, but under grace ( <a ref='Romans 6:14–15'>6:14–15</a> ), Paul teaches that: 1) the law can no longer condemn a believer ( <a ref='Romans 7:1–6'>7:1–6</a> ); 2) it convicts unbelievers (and believers) of sin ( <a ref='Romans 7:7–13'>7:7–13</a> ); 3) it cannot deliver a believer from sin ( <a ref='Romans 7:14–25'>7:14–25</a> ); and 4) believers who walk in the power of the Spirit can fulfill the law ( <a ref='Romans 8:1–4'>8:1–4</a> ). <a ref='Romans 7:1'>7:1</a> <b>know the law.</b> Lit. “those who know law.” Although Paul intends to include God’s written law, he is not referring to any specific law code, but to a principle that is true of all law—Greek, Roman, Jewish, or biblical. <b>master.</b> No matter how serious a criminal’s offenses may be, he is no longer subject to prosecution and punishment after he dies. <a ref='Romans 7:2–3'>7:2–3</a> These two verses are not a complex allegory, but a simple analogy, using marriage law to illustrate the point Paul just made about law’s jurisdiction (v. <a ref='Romans 7:1'>1</a> ). This passage is not teaching that only the death of a spouse frees a Christian to remarry; it is not teaching about divorce and remarriage at all. Both Christ and Paul have fully addressed those issues elsewhere (cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:31–32'>Mt 5:31–32</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 19:3–12'>19:3–12</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 7:10–15'>1Co 7:10–15</a> ). <a ref='Romans 7:3'>7:3</a> The law that governs a married woman’s actions no longer has any jurisdiction over her once her husband dies. Widows are free to marry again, and Paul even encourages younger ones to remarry as long as their potential mate is a believer ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 7:39'>1Co 7:39</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 5:14'>1Ti 5:14</a> ). Even the legitimately divorced can marry again ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Corinthians 7:8–9'>1Co 7:8–9</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 7:4'>7:4</a> <b>So.</b> The logical conclusion or application of Paul’s brief argument (vv. <a ref='Romans 7:1–3'>1–3</a> ) follows. <b>made to die.</b> The Greek construction of this verb emphasizes two important points: 1) this death happened at a point in time, with results that are complete and final; and 2) someone else—in this case God Himself—initiated this death (lit. “you also were made to die”). In response to faith in His Son, God makes the believing sinner forever dead to the condemnation and penalty of the law (cf. <a ref='Romans 8:1'>8:1</a> ). <b>through the body of Christ.</b> Because, as the substitute for sinners, He suffered the penalty of death that the law demanded. <b>be joined to another.</b> Just as the widow in Paul’s analogy (vv. <a ref='Romans 7:2–3'>2–3</a> ) was freed to remarry, the believer has been freed from his hostile relationship to a law that condemned him, and can, therefore, be remarried—this time to Christ (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 11:2'>2Co 11:2</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:24–27'>Eph 5:24–27</a> ). <b>fruit.</b> A transformed life that manifests new attitudes ( <a ref='Galatians 5:22–23'>Ga 5:22–23</a> ) and actions ( <a ref='John 15:1–2'>Jn 15:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 1:11'>Php 1:11</a> ; cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 2:19–20'>Ga 2:19–20</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:10'>Eph 2:10</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 1:13'>1:13</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 7:5'>7:5</a> <b>flesh.</b> Scripture uses this term in a nonmoral sense to describe man’s physical being ( <a ref='John 1:14'>Jn 1:14</a> ), and in a morally evil sense to describe man’s unredeemed humanness ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 6:6'>6:6</a> ; <a ref='Ro 8'>Ro 8</a> ; <a ref='Ga 5'>Ga 5</a> ; <a ref='Eph 2'>Eph 2</a></i> ), i.e., that remnant of the old self which will remain with each believer until each receives his or her glorified body ( <a ref='Romans 8:23'>8:23</a> ). “In the flesh” here describes a person who is able to operate only in the sphere of fallen mankind—an unredeemed, unregenerate person ( <a ref='Romans 8:9'>8:9</a> ). Although the believer can manifest some of the deeds of the flesh, he can never again be “in the flesh.” <b>sinful passions.</b> The overwhelming impulses to think and do evil, which characterize those who are “in the flesh” ( <a ref='Ephesians 2:3'>Eph 2:3</a> ). aroused <b>by the Law.</b> The unbeliever’s rebellious nature is awakened when restrictions are placed on him and make him want to do the very things the law forbids ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 7:8'>8</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 1:32'>1:32</a> ). <b>members.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 6:13'>6:13</a> .</i> <b>fruit for death.</b> The sinful passions at work in unbelievers produce a harvest of eternal death ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 5:12'>5:12</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Galatians 6:7–8'>Ga 6:7–8</a> ). <a ref='Romans 7:6'>7:6</a> <b>released from the Law.</b> Not freedom to do what God’s law forbids ( <a ref='Romans 6:1'>6:1</a> , <a ref='Romans 6:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:4'>8:4</a> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 3:31'>3:31</a> ), but freedom from the spiritual liabilities and penalties of God’s law ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 7:4'>4</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Galatians 3:13'>Ga 3:13</a> ). Because we died in Christ when He died ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 6:2'>6:2</a></i> ), the law with its condemnation and penalties no longer has jurisdiction over us (vv. <a ref='Romans 7:1–3'>1–3</a> ). <b>serve.</b> This is the verb form of the word for “bond-servant” ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 1:1'>1:1</a></i> ), but here it is parallel to being slaves of righteousness (cf. <a ref='Romans 6:18–19'>6:18–19</a> , <a ref='Romans 6:22'>22</a> ), emphasizing that this service is not voluntary. Not only is the believer able to do what is right, he will do what is right. <b>newness of the Spirit.</b> A new state of mind which the Spirit produces, characterized by a new desire and ability to keep the law of God ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 8:4'>8:4</a></i> ). <b>oldness of the letter.</b> The external, written law code that produced only hostility and condemnation. <a ref='Romans 7:7'>7:7</a> <b>Is the Law sin?</b> Paul wanted to make certain his readers did not conclude (from vv. <a ref='Romans 7:4–6'>4–6</a> ) that the law itself was evil (cf. v. <a ref='Romans 7:12'>12</a> ). <b>I would not have come to know sin.</b> The law reveals the divine standard, and as believers compare themselves against that standard, they can accurately identify sin, which is the failure to meet the standard. Paul uses the personal pronoun “I” throughout the rest of the chapter, using his own experience as an example of what is true of unredeemed mankind (vv. <a ref='Romans 7:7–12'>7–12</a> ) and true of Christians (vv. <a ref='Romans 7:13–25'>13–25</a> ). covet <b>.</b> Quoted from <a ref='Exodus 20:17'>Ex 20:17</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:21'>Dt 5:21</a> . <a ref='Romans 7:8'>7:8</a> <b>opportunity through the commandment.</b> The word “opportunity” describes a starting point or base of operations for an expedition. Sin uses the specific requirements of the law as a base of operation from which to launch its evil work. Confronted by God’s law, the sinner’s rebellious nature finds the forbidden thing more attractive, not because it is inherently attractive, but because it furnishes an opportunity to assert one’s self-will. <b>sin</b> is <b>dead.</b> Not lifeless or nonexistent ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 5:12–13'>5:12–13</a></i> ), but dormant. When the law comes, sin becomes fully active and overwhelms the sinner. <a ref='Romans 7:9'>7:9</a> <b>from the Law.</b> Not ignorance of or lack of concern for the law (cf. <a ref='Philippians 3:6'>Php 3:6</a> ), but a purely external, imperfect conception of it. <b>when the commandment came.</b> When he began to understand the true requirements of God’s moral law at some point prior to his conversion. <b>sin revived.</b> He realized his true condition as a desperately wicked sinner (cf. <a ref='1 Timothy 1:15'>1Ti 1:15</a> ). <b>I died.</b> He realized his deadness, spiritually; that all his religious credentials and accomplishments were rubbish ( <a ref='Philippians 3:7–8'>Php 3:7–8</a> ). <a ref='Romans 7:10'>7:10</a> <b>was to lead to life.</b> Theoretically, perfect obedience to the law could bring eternal life, and with it happiness and holiness. But no one except Christ has—or could—ever fully obey it ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 10:5'>10:5</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 7:11'>7:11</a> <b>sin … deceived me.</b> By leading him to expect life from his keeping of the law, when what he found was death (v. <a ref='Romans 7:10'>10</a> ); and by convincing him that he is acceptable to God because of his own merit and good works. <a ref='Romans 7:12'>7:12</a> The fact that the law reveals, arouses, and condemns sin, bringing death to the sinner, does not mean that the law is evil (cf. v. <a ref='Romans 7:7'>7</a> ). Rather the law is a perfect reflection of God’s holy character (cf. vv. <a ref='Romans 7:14'>14</a> , <a ref='Romans 7:16'>16</a> , <a ref='Romans 7:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 19:7–11'>Ps 19:7–11</a> ) and the standard for believers to please Him. <a ref='Romans 7:13'>7:13</a> <b>did that which is good become … death.</b> Sin is the cause of spiritual death, not the good law. <b>sin would become … sinful.</b> An awareness of the true nature of sin and its deadly character, which brings the sinner to see his need of salvation—the very purpose God intended the law to serve ( <a ref='Galatians 3:19–22'>Ga 3:19–22</a> ). <a ref='Romans 7:14–25'>7:14–25</a> Some interpret this chronicle of Paul’s inner conflict as describing his life before Christ. They point out that Paul describes the person as “sold … under sin” (v. <a ref='Romans 7:14'>14</a> ); as having “nothing good” in him (v. <a ref='Romans 7:18'>18</a> ); and as a “wretched man” trapped in a “body of death” (v. <a ref='Romans 7:24'>24</a> ). Those descriptions seem to contradict the way Paul describes the believer in chap. <a ref='Ro 6'>6</a> (cf. vv. <a ref='Romans 6:2'>2</a> , <a ref='Romans 6:6–7'>6–7</a> , <a ref='Romans 6:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Romans 6:17–18'>17–18</a> , <a ref='Romans 6:22'>22</a> ). However, it is correct to understand Paul here to be speaking about a believer. This person desires to obey God’s law and hates his sin (vv. <a ref='Romans 7:15'>15</a> , <a ref='Romans 7:19'>19</a> , <a ref='Romans 7:21'>21</a> ); he is humble, recognizing that nothing good dwells in his humanness (v. <a ref='Romans 7:18'>18</a> ); he sees sin in himself, but not as all that is there (vv. <a ref='Romans 7:17'>17</a> , <a ref='Romans 7:20–22'>20–22</a> ); and he serves Jesus Christ with his mind (v. <a ref='Romans 7:25'>25</a> ). Paul has already established that none of those attitudes ever describe the unsaved (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:18–21'>1:18–21</a> , <a ref='Romans 1:32'>32</a> ; <a ref='Romans 3:10–20'>3:10–20</a> ). Paul’s use of present tense verbs in vv. <a ref='Romans 7:14–25'>14–25</a> strongly supports the idea that he is describing his life currently as a Christian. For those reasons, it seems certain that chap. <a ref='Ro 7'>7</a> describes a believer. However, of those who agree that this is a believer, there is still disagreement. Some see a carnal, fleshly Christian; others a legalistic Christian, frustrated by his feeble attempts in his own power to please God by keeping the Mosaic law. But the personal pronoun “I” refers to the apostle Paul, a standard of spiritual health and maturity. So, in vv. <a ref='Romans 7:14–25'>14–25</a> Paul must be describing all Christians—even the most spiritual and mature—who, when they honestly evaluate themselves against the righteous standard of God’s law, realize how far short they fall. He does so in a series of 4 laments (vv. <a ref='Romans 7:14–17'>14–17</a> , <a ref='Romans 7:18–20'>18–20</a> , <a ref='Romans 7:21–23'>21–23</a> , <a ref='Romans 7:24–25'>24–25</a> ). <a ref='Romans 7:14'>7:14</a> <b>the Law is spiritual.</b> I.e., it reflects God’s holy character. <b>fleshly.</b> This means earthbound, mortal, and still incarcerated in unredeemed humanness. Paul does not say he is still “in the flesh” ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 7:5'>7:5</a></i> ), but the flesh is in him. <b>sold … under sin.</b> Sin no longer controls the whole man (as with an unbeliever; cf. <a ref='Romans 6:6'>6:6</a> ), but it does hold captive the believer’s members, or his fleshly body (v. <a ref='Romans 7:23'>23</a> ; cf. v. <a ref='Romans 7:18'>18</a> ). Sin contaminates him and frustrates his inner desire to obey the will of God. <a ref='Romans 7:15'>7:15</a> <b>understand.</b> This refers to knowledge that goes beyond the factual and includes the idea of an intimate relationship (cf. <a ref='Galatians 4:9'>Ga 4:9</a> ). By extension, this word was sometimes used to express approving or accepting (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 8:3'>1Co 8:3</a> ). That is its sense here, i.e., Paul found himself doing things he did not approve of. <a ref='Romans 7:16'>7:16</a> <b>I agree with the Law, that it is good.</b> Paul’s new nature defends the divine standard—the perfectly righteous law is not responsible for his sin (v. <a ref='Romans 7:12'>12</a> ). His new self longs to honor the law and keep it perfectly (v. <a ref='Romans 7:22'>22</a> ). <a ref='Romans 7:17'>7:17</a> <b>no longer am I the one working it out.</b> The Greek adverb for “no longer” signifies a complete and permanent change. Paul’s new inner self ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 6:6'>6:6</a></i> ), the new “I,” no longer approved of the sin that was still residing in his flesh, as his old self did (cf. v. <a ref='Romans 7:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 2:20'>Ga 2:20</a> ), but rather, strongly disapproved. Many have misconstrued Paul’s comments as abdicating personal responsibility for his sin by embracing a form of Greek dualism (which would later spawn gnosticism; see Introduction to 1 John ). Dualism taught that the body is evil and the spirit is good, so its adherents sinned with impunity by claiming they were not responsible; their sin was entirely the product of their physical bodies, while their spirits remained untouched and unsullied. But the apostle has already acknowledged personal guilt for his sin (v. <a ref='Romans 7:14'>14</a> ; cf. <a ref='1 John 1:10'>1Jn 1:10</a> ). <b>sin which dwells in me.</b> His sin does not flow out of his new redeemed innermost self (“I”), but from his unredeemed humanness, his flesh “in me” ( <a ref='Galatians 5:17'>Ga 5:17</a> ). <a ref='Romans 7:18'>7:18</a> <b>nothing good dwells in me.</b> The flesh serves as a base camp from which sin operates in the Christian’s life. It is not sinful inherently ( <i>see note <a ref='Romans 6:6'>6:6</a></i> ), but because of its fallenness, it is still subject to sin and is thoroughly contaminated. <b>my flesh.</b> The part of the believer’s present being that remains unredeemed ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 6:6'>6:6</a> , <a ref='Romans 6:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Romans 7:5'>7:5</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 7:20'>7:20</a> <b>no longer the one working it out, but sin.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Romans 7:17'>17</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 7:21'>7:21</a> <b>principle.</b> A reference to an inviolable spiritual principle. <a ref='Romans 7:22'>7:22</a> <b>I joyfully concur with the law of God.</b> The believer’s justified, new inner self no longer sides with sin, but joyfully agrees with the law of God against sin ( <a ref='Psalms 1:2'>Pss 1:2</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 119:14'>119:14</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:47'>47</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:77'>77</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:105'>105</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:140'>140</a> ; cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:16'>2Co 4:16</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 3:16'>Eph 3:16</a> ). <a ref='Romans 7:23'>7:23</a> <b>a different law.</b> A corresponding spiritual principle to the one in v. <a ref='Romans 7:21'>21</a> . But this principle, which Paul identifies as “the law of sin,” operates in the members of his body—that is, his unredeemed and still sinful humanness ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 6:6'>6:6</a></i> )—waging war against his desire to obey God’s law. <b>law of my mind.</b> Equivalent to the new inner self ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:17'>2Co 5:17</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 6:6'>6:6</a></i> ), which longs to obey the law of God ( <i>see notes on vv. <a ref='Romans 7:21–22'>21–22</a></i> ). Paul is not saying his mind is spiritual and his body is inherently evil ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 7:17'>17</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 7:24'>7:24</a> <b>Wretched man.</b> In frustration and grief, Paul laments his sin (cf. <a ref='Psalms 38:14'>Pss 38:14</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 130:1–5'>130:1–5</a> ). A believer perceives his own sinfulness in direct proportion to how clearly he sees the holiness of God and perfection of His law. <b>deliver me.</b> This word means “to rescue from danger” and was used of a soldier pulling his wounded comrade from the battlefield. Paul longed to be rescued from his sinful flesh (cf. <a ref='Romans 8:23'>8:23</a> ). <b>body of … death.</b> The believer’s unredeemed humanness, which has its base of operation in the body ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 6:6'>6:6</a> , <a ref='Romans 6:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Romans 7:5'>7:5</a></i> ). Tradition says that an ancient tribe near Tarsus tied the corpse of a murder victim to its murderer, allowing its spreading decay to slowly infect and execute the murderer—perhaps that is the image Paul has in mind. <a ref='Romans 7:25'>7:25</a> The first half of this verse answers the question Paul just raised (v. <a ref='Romans 7:24'>24</a> )—he is certain that Christ will eventually rescue him when He returns (cf. <a ref='Romans 8:18'>8:18</a> , <a ref='Romans 8:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:52–53'>1Co 15:52–53</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:56–57'>56–57</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:4'>2Co 5:4</a> ). The second half summarizes the two sides of the struggle Paul has described (vv. <a ref='Romans 7:14–24'>14–24</a> ). <b>I myself.</b> Paul’s new redeemed self ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 6:6'>6:6</a></i> ). <b>with my mind.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Romans 7:23'>23</a> .</i> <b>my flesh.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Romans 6:6'>6:6</a> , <a ref='Romans 6:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Romans 7:5'>7:5</a> .</i> <b>law of sin.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Romans 7:23'>23</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 8:1'>8:1</a> <b>Therefore.</b> The result or consequence of the truth just taught. Normally, it marks the conclusion of the verses immediately preceding it. But here it introduces the staggering results of Paul’s teaching in the first 7 chapters: that justification is by faith alone on the basis of God’s overwhelming grace. <b>no condemnation.</b> Occurring only 3 times in the NT, all in Romans (cf. <a ref='Romans 5:16'>5:16</a> , <a ref='Romans 5:18'>18</a> ), “condemnation” is used exclusively in judicial settings as the opposite of justification. It refers to a verdict of guilty and the penalty that verdict demands. No sin a believer can commit—past, present, or future—can be held against him, since the penalty was paid by Christ and righteousness was imputed to the believer. And no sin will ever reverse this divine legal decision ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 8:33'>33</a></i> ). <b>those … in Christ Jesus.</b> I.e., every true Christian; to be in Christ means to be united with Him ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 6:2'>6:2</a> , <a ref='Romans 6:11'>11</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 6:1–11'>6:1–11</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:13'>1Co 12:13</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:27'>27</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:22'>15:22</a> ). <a ref='Romans 8:2–30'>8:2–30</a> The Spirit, who was mentioned only once in chaps. <a ref='Ro 1-7'>1–7</a> (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:4'>1:4</a> ), is referred to nearly 20 times in chap. <a ref='Ro 8'>8</a> . He frees us from sin and death (vv. <a ref='Romans 8:2–3'>2–3</a> ); enables us to fulfill God’s law (v. <a ref='Romans 8:4'>4</a> ); changes our nature and grants us strength for victory over our unredeemed flesh (vv. <a ref='Romans 8:5–13'>5–13</a> ); confirms our adoption as God’s children (vv. <a ref='Romans 8:14–16'>14–16</a> ); and guarantees our ultimate glory (vv. <a ref='Romans 8:17–30'>17–30</a> ). <a ref='Romans 8:2'>8:2</a> The word “for” introduces the reason there is no condemnation for the believer; the Spirit has replaced the law that produced only sin and death ( <a ref='Romans 7:5'>7:5</a> , <a ref='Romans 7:13'>13</a> ) with a new, simple law that produces life: the law of faith ( <a ref='Romans 3:27'>3:27</a> ), or the message of the gospel. <b>the law of the Spirit of life.</b> Synonymous with the gospel, the law of faith. <b>the law of sin and of death.</b> The law of God. Although it is good, holy, and righteous ( <a ref='Romans 7:12'>7:12</a> ), because of the weakness of the flesh ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 7:7–11'>7:7–11</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:3'>8:3</a></i> ), it can produce only sin and death ( <a ref='Romans 7:5'>7:5</a> , <a ref='Romans 7:13'>13</a> ). <a ref='Romans 8:3'>8:3</a> <b>what the Law could not do.</b> Deliver sinners from its penalty ( <a ref='Acts 13:38–39'>Ac 13:38–39</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:10'>Ga 3:10</a> ) or make them righteous ( <a ref='Galatians 3:21'>Ga 3:21</a> ). <b>weak … the flesh.</b> Because of the sinful corruption of unregenerate men, the law was powerless to produce righteousness ( <a ref='Galatians 3:21'>Ga 3:21</a> ). <b>His own Son.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Psalms 2:7'>Ps 2:7</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 4:4'>Ga 4:4</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 2:6–7'>Php 2:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 1:1–5'>Heb 1:1–5</a> .</i> <b>in the likeness of sinful flesh.</b> Although in His incarnation Christ became fully man ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 1:3'>1:3</a></i> ), He took only the outward appearance of sinful flesh, because He was completely without sin ( <a ref='Hebrews 4:15'>Heb 4:15</a> ). <b>condemned sin in the flesh.</b> God’s condemnation against sin was fully poured out on the sinless flesh of Christ ( <a ref='Isaiah 53:4–8'>Is 53:4–8</a> ; cf. <a ref='Philippians 2:7'>Php 2:7</a> ). <a ref='Romans 8:4'>8:4</a> <b>requirement of the Law.</b> The thoughts, words, and deeds which the moral law of God demands. The ceremonial aspect of the Mosaic law has been set aside ( <a ref='Colossians 2:14–17'>Col 2:14–17</a> ), and the basic responsibility for the civil aspect, which shows the application of the moral law in a community, has been transferred to human government ( <a ref='Romans 13:1–7'>13:1–7</a> ). The moral law finds its basis in the character of God and is presented in outline form in the Ten Commandments; its most condensed form is in Jesus’ commands to love God and to love one’s neighbor as one’s self. It has never been abrogated, but finds its authority in the New Covenant. Every unbeliever is still under its requirement of perfection and its condemnation, until he comes to Christ ( <a ref='Galatians 3:23–25'>Ga 3:23–25</a> ), and every believer still finds in it the standard for behavior. <b>fulfilled.</b> Although the believer is no longer in bondage to the moral law’s condemnation and penalty ( <a ref='Romans 7:6'>7:6</a> ), the law still reflects the moral character of God and His will for His creatures. But what the external, written code was unable to accomplish, the Spirit is able to do by writing the law on our hearts ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:33–34'>Jer 31:33–34</a> ) and giving us the power to obey it. <b>not walk according to the flesh but … the Spirit.</b> Not an admonition, but a statement of fact that applies to all believers. “Walk” refers to a lifestyle, the habits of living and thinking that characterize a person’s life (cf. <a ref='Luke 1:6'>Lk 1:6</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 4:17'>Eph 4:17</a> ; <a ref='1 John 1:7'>1Jn 1:7</a> ). Since every true Christian is indwelt by the Spirit (v. <a ref='Romans 8:9'>9</a> ), every Christian will manifest the fruit He produces in his life ( <a ref='Galatians 5:22–23'>Ga 5:22–23</a> ). <a ref='Romans 8:5'>8:5</a> <b>those who are according to the flesh.</b> All unbelievers ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 8:4'>4</a></i> ). <b>set their minds.</b> This Greek verb refers to a basic orientation of the mind—a mindset that includes one’s affections, mental processes, and will (cf. <a ref='Philippians 2:2'>Php 2:2</a> , <a ref='Philippians 2:5'>5</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:15'>3:15</a> , <a ref='Philippians 3:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 3:2'>Col 3:2</a> ). Paul’s point is that unbelievers’ basic disposition is to satisfy the cravings of their unredeemed flesh ( <a ref='Philippians 3:19'>Php 3:19</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 2:10'>2Pe 2:10</a> ). <b>those who are according to the Spirit.</b> All believers ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 8:4'>4</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 8:6'>8:6</a> <b>mind set on the flesh.</b> This is a simple spiritual equation: The person with the mind set on the flesh is spiritually dead (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:14'>1Co 2:14</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:1'>Eph 2:1</a> ). <b>mind set on the Spirit.</b> This describes every Christian. The person with his mind set on the things of the Spirit is very much spiritually alive and at peace with God ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 5:1'>5:1</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Ephesians 2:5'>Eph 2:5</a> ). <a ref='Romans 8:7'>8:7</a> <b>at enmity toward God.</b> The unbeliever’s problem is much deeper than acts of disobedience, which are merely outward manifestations of inner fleshly compulsions. His basic inclinations and orientation toward gratifying himself—however outwardly religious or moral he may appear—are directly hostile to God. Even the good deeds unbelievers perform are not truly a fulfillment of God’s law, because they are produced by the flesh, for selfish reasons, and from a heart that is in rebellion ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 5:1'>5:1</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 8:8'>8:8</a> <b>in the flesh.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 7:5'>7:5</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 8:9'>8:9</a> <b>dwells.</b> Refers to being in one’s own home. The Spirit of God makes His home in every person who trusts in Jesus Christ. Cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:19–20'>1Co 6:19–20</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:13'>12:13</a> . When there is no evidence of His presence by the fruit He produces ( <a ref='Galatians 5:22–23'>Ga 5:22–23</a> ), a person has no legitimate claim to Christ as Savior and Lord. <a ref='Romans 8:10'>8:10</a> <b>the body is dead because of sin.</b> The body is unredeemed and dead in sin ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 6:6'>6:6</a> , <a ref='Romans 6:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Romans 7:5'>7:5</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 8:11'>8:11</a> , <a ref='Romans 8:23'>23</a> ). <b>the spirit is alive because of righteousness.</b> It is best to translate the word “spirit” as the person’s spirit, not the Holy Spirit. Paul is saying that if God’s Spirit indwells you (v. <a ref='Romans 8:9'>9</a> ), the human spirit is alive (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 2:5'>Eph 2:5</a> ) and can manifest true righteousness (cf. v. <a ref='Romans 8:4'>4</a> ). <a ref='Romans 8:11'>8:11</a> <b>your mortal bodies.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 6:12'>6:12</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 8:23'>8:23</a> . <a ref='Romans 8:12'>8:12</a> <b>the flesh.</b> Our unredeemed humanness—that complex of sinful passions that sin generates through its one remaining domain, our bodies ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 6:6'>6:6</a> , <a ref='Romans 6:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Romans 7:5'>7:5</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 8:13'>8:13</a> <b>putting to death the practices of the body.</b> Paul’s first instruction concerning what his readers must do in the struggle with sin destroys several false views of how believers are made holy: 1) that in a crisis moment we are immediately made perfect; 2) that we must “let God” take over while we remain idle; and 3) that some turning-point decision will propel us to a higher level of holiness. Rather, the apostle says the Spirit provides us with the energy and power to continually and gradually be killing our sins, a process never completed in this life. The means the Spirit uses to accomplish this process is our faithful obedience to the simple commands of Scripture ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Ephesians 5:18'>Eph 5:18</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 3:16'>Col 3:16</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 13:14'>13:14</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 1:2'>Pss 1:2</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 119:11'>119:11</a> ; <a ref='Luke 22:40'>Lk 22:40</a> ; <a ref='John 17:17'>Jn 17:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:18'>1Co 6:18</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 9:25–27'>9:25–27</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:11'>1Pe 2:11</a> ). <a ref='Romans 8:14'>8:14</a> <b>led by the Spirit.</b> Believers are not led through subjective, mental impressions or promptings to provide direction in making life’s decisions—something Scripture nowhere teaches. Instead, God’s Spirit objectively leads His children sometimes through the orchestration of circumstances ( <a ref='Acts 16:7'>Ac 16:7</a> ) but primarily through: 1) illumination, divinely clarifying Scripture to make it understandable to our sinful, finite minds ( <a ref='Luke 24:44–45'>Lk 24:44–45</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:14–16'>1Co 2:14–16</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:17–19'>Eph 1:17–19</a> ; cf. <a ref='Ephesians 3:16–19'>Eph 3:16–19</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:9'>Col 1:9</a> ); and 2) sanctification, divinely enabling us to obey Scripture ( <a ref='Galatians 5:16–17'>Ga 5:16–17</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 5:25'>5:25</a> ). <b>sons of God.</b> When a person experiences the Spirit’s leading in those ways, he gains assurance that God has adopted him into His family ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 8:15–17'>8:15–17</a> ; <a ref='1 John 3:2'>1Jn 3:2</a></i> ; for other tests of true faith see Introduction to 1 John: Historical and Theological Themes ). <a ref='Romans 8:15'>8:15</a> <b>spirit of slavery … to fear.</b> Because of their life of sin, unregenerate people are slaves to their fear of death ( <a ref='Hebrews 2:14–15'>Heb 2:14–15</a> ), and to their fear of final punishment ( <a ref='1 John 4:18'>1Jn 4:18</a> ). <b>Spirit of adoption.</b> Not primarily a reference to the transaction by which God adopts us ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Ephesians 1:5'>Eph 1:5</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 4:5–6'>Ga 4:5–6</a></i> ), but to a Spirit-produced awareness of the rich reality that God has made us His children, and, therefore, that we can come before Him without fear or hesitation as our beloved Father. It includes the confidence that we are truly sons of God. <b>Abba!</b> An informal, Aramaic term for Father that conveys a sense of intimacy.

The result is an almost poetic expression of praise for God’s grace in bringing salvation to completion for all who are chosen and believe—a hymn of security. <a ref='Romans 8:31'>8:31</a> <b>If God</b> is <b>for us.</b> The Greek construction is better translated, “Since God is for us.” <a ref='Romans 8:32'>8:32</a> Paul’s point is: Would God do less for His children than He did for His enemies? <b>graciously give.</b> This word means “to bestow out of grace.” Paul often uses it to denote forgiveness ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 2:7'>2Co 2:7</a> , <a ref='2 Corinthians 2:10'>10</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 12:13'>12:13</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:13'>Col 2:13</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 3:13'>3:13</a> ) and may intend that here. <b>all things.</b> Referring either to every sin the believer commits (if “graciously give” is translated “forgiveness”) or to whatever is necessary to complete the purpose He had in choosing us (vv. <a ref='Romans 8:29–30'>29–30</a> ; cf. <a ref='Philippians 1:6'>Php 1:6</a> ). <a ref='Romans 8:33–34'>8:33–34</a> The setting of these verses is the divine courtroom. <a ref='Romans 8:33'>8:33</a> <b>God’s elect.</b> <i>See notes on vv. <a ref='Romans 8:29–30'>29–30</a> .</i> <b>God is the one who justifies.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 3:24'>3:24</a> .</i> Who can successfully accuse someone whom God has declared righteous? <a ref='Romans 8:34'>8:34</a> <b>condemns.</b> To declare guilty and sentence to punishment.

Although Paul understood the exchange he was suggesting was impossible ( <a ref='Romans 8:38–39'>8:38–39</a> ; <a ref='John 10:28'>Jn 10:28</a> ), it was still the sincere expression of his deep love for his fellow Jews (cf. <a ref='Exodus 32:32'>Ex 32:32</a> ). <a ref='Romans 9:4'>9:4</a> <b>Israelites.</b> The descendants of Abraham through Jacob, whose name God changed to Israel ( <a ref='Genesis 32:28'>Ge 32:28</a> ). <b>adoption.</b> Not in the sense of providing salvation to every person born a Jew ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 8:15–23'>8:15–23</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 9:6'>9:6</a> ), but sovereignly selecting an entire nation to receive His special calling, covenant, and blessing and to serve as His witness nation ( <a ref='Exodus 4:22'>Ex 4:22</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 19:6'>19:6</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 11:1'>Hos 11:1</a> ; cf. <a ref='Isaiah 46:3–4'>Is 46:3–4</a> ). <b>glory.</b> The glory cloud (Shekinah) that pictured God’s presence in the OT ( <a ref='Exodus 16:10'>Ex 16:10</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 24:16–17'>24:16–17</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 29:42–43'>29:42–43</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 9:23'>Lv 9:23</a> ). His glory was supremely present in the Holy of Holies in both the tabernacle and the temple, which served as the throne room of Yahweh, Israel’s King ( <a ref='Exodus 25:22'>Ex 25:22</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 40:34'>40:34</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 8:11'>1Ki 8:11</a> ). <b>covenants.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Genesis 9:16'>Ge 9:16</a> .</i> A covenant is a legally binding promise, agreement, or contract. Three times in the NT the word “covenants” is used in the plural ( <a ref='Galatians 4:24'>Ga 4:24</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:12'>Eph 2:12</a> ). All but one of God’s covenants with man are eternal and unilateral—that is, God promised to accomplish something based on His own character and not on the response or actions of the promised beneficiary. The 6 biblical covenants include: 1) the covenant with Noah ( <a ref='Genesis 9:8–17'>Ge 9:8–17</a> ); 2) the covenant with Abraham ( <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 4:13'>4:13</a></i> ); 3) the covenant of law given through Moses at Sinai ( <a ref='Ex 19-31'>Ex 19–31</a> ; cf. <a ref='De 29-30'>Dt 29–30</a> ); 4) the priestly covenant ( <a ref='Numbers 25:10–13'>Nu 25:10–13</a> ); 5) the covenant of an eternal kingdom through David’s greatest Son ( <a ref='2 Samuel 7:8–16'>2Sa 7:8–16</a> ); and 6) the New Covenant ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer 31:31–34</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 37:26'>Eze 37:26</a> ; cf. <a ref='Hebrews 8:6–13'>Heb 8:6–13</a> ). All but the Mosaic Covenant are eternal and unilateral. It is neither, since Israel’s sin abrogated it and it has been replaced by the New Covenant (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 8:7–13'>Heb 8:7–13</a> ). temple <b>service.</b> This refers to the entire sacrificial and ceremonial system that God revealed through Moses (cf. <a ref='Exodus 29:43–46'>Ex 29:43–46</a> ). <b>promises.</b> Probably this refers to the promised Messiah, who would come out of Israel, bringing eternal life and an eternal kingdom (cf. <a ref='Acts 2:39'>Ac 2:39</a> ; <a ref='Acts 13:32–34'>13:32–34</a> ; <a ref='Acts 26:6'>26:6</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:16'>Ga 3:16</a> , <a ref='Galatians 3:21'>21</a> ). <a ref='Romans 9:5'>9:5</a> <b>fathers.</b> The patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, through whom the promises of the Messiah were fulfilled. <b>Christ … God … blessed forever.</b> This is not intended primarily as a benediction, but as an affirmation of the sovereignty and deity of Christ. <a ref='Romans 9:6'>9:6</a> <b>word of God.</b> This refers specifically to the privileges and promises God had revealed to Israel (v. <a ref='Romans 9:4'>4</a> ; cf. <a ref='Isaiah 55:11'>Is 55:11</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 32:42'>Jer 32:42</a> ). <b>not all Israel who are</b> descended <b>from Israel.</b> Not all the physical descendants of Abraham are true heirs of the promise ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 2:28–29'>2:28–29</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 9:7'>9:7</a> To illustrate the truth of v. <a ref='Romans 9:6'>6</a> , Paul reminds his readers that even the racial and national promises made to Abraham were not made to every physical descendant of his, but only to those who came through Isaac. Cf. <a ref='Genesis 21:12'>Ge 21:12</a> . <b>children.</b> Only Isaac’s descendants could truly be called the children of Abraham, the inheritors of those racial and national promises ( <a ref='Genesis 17:19–21'>Ge 17:19–21</a> ). <a ref='Romans 9:8'>9:8</a> <b>children of the flesh.</b> Abraham’s other children by Hagar and Keturah were not chosen to receive the national promises made to him. <b>children of God.</b> Paul’s point is that just as not all of Abraham’s descendants belonged to the physical people of God—or national Israel—not all of those who are true children of Abraham through Isaac are the true spiritual people of God and enjoy the promises made to Abraham’s spiritual children ( <a ref='Romans 4:6'>4:6</a> , <a ref='Romans 4:11'>11</a> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 11:3–4'>11:3–4</a> ). <a ref='Romans 9:9'>9:9</a> Quoted from <a ref='Genesis 18:10'>Ge 18:10</a> . <a ref='Romans 9:11'>9:11</a> the twins <b>.</b> The twins Jacob and Esau. <b>done anything good or bad.</b> God’s choice of Jacob, instead of Esau, to continue the physical line was not based on his personal merit or demerit. <b>the purpose of God according to</b> His <b>choice.</b> Rather, God’s choice of Jacob resides solely in His own sovereign plan, a perfect example of election unto salvation. God has chosen some Jews—and some Gentiles—but not all, for salvation. <b>not because of works but because of Him who calls.</b> The fact that God made His choice of Jacob before the boys were born and apart from personal merit demonstrates that election unto spiritual life is unrelated to any human effort, and is based only on the prerogative of God who makes His selection ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 8:29'>8:29</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:9'>1Co 1:9</a> ). <a ref='Romans 9:12'>9:12</a> Quoted from <a ref='Genesis 25:23'>Ge 25:23</a> . <a ref='Romans 9:13'>9:13</a> Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated <b>.</b> This difficult statement is a quotation from <a ref='Malachi 1:2–3'>Mal 1:2–3</a> . The broader context of the quote is even more difficult. Some have tried to make this about corporate entities, as an attempt to mitigate the offense. But that position does not faithfully represent Paul’s argument. God’s selection of Jacob and rejection of Esau is proof of what is commonly known as <i>predestination</i> , meaning God has chosen some to be His people (election) and rejected others (reprobation). This should not be taken to mean that God works in the elect and the reprobate in an equal manner. Because God is holy, He cannot cause a man to sin; instead, He uses secondary causes (oftentimes the reprobate, himself), to bring about the just condemnation of the reprobate. <a ref='Romans 9:14'>9:14</a> <b>Is there any unrighteousness with God.</b> Paul once again anticipates his readers’ objection to Paul’s theology: if God were to choose some people for salvation and pass over others apart from their merits or actions, that would make God arbitrary and unfair (cf. <a ref='Genesis 18:25'>Ge 18:25</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 7:9'>Pss 7:9</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 48:10'>48:10</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 71:19'>71:19</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 119:137'>119:137</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:142'>142</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 9:23–24'>Jer 9:23–24</a> ). <a ref='Romans 9:15'>9:15</a> Quoted from <a ref='Exodus 33:19'>Ex 33:19</a> . In response to the accusation that such a teaching about God’s sovereign election is inconsistent with His fairness, Paul cites this text from the OT that clearly indicates that God is absolutely sovereign and does elect who will be saved without violating His other attributes. He determines who receives mercy. <a ref='Romans 9:16'>9:16</a> <b>it.</b> God’s gracious choice of certain people unto eternal life ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 8:29'>8:29</a></i> ). <b>who wills.</b> Salvation is not initiated by human choice—even faith is a gift of God ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 1:16'>1:16</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='John 6:37'>Jn 6:37</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:8–9'>Eph 2:8–9</a> ). <b>who runs.</b> Salvation is not merited by human effort ( <i>see notes on v. <a ref='Romans 9:11'>11</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 9:17'>9:17</a> Quoted from <a ref='Exodus 9:16'>Ex 9:16</a> .

Undoubtedly, Pharaoh thought his position and actions were of his own free choice to accomplish his own purposes, but in reality he was there to serve God’s purpose. My name <b>.</b> The sum of the character of God (cf. <a ref='Exodus 34:5–7'>Ex 34:5–7</a> ). <a ref='Romans 9:18'>9:18</a> The mighty act of God in freeing Israel from the hand of Pharaoh demonstrated two corollary truths. Both Moses and Pharaoh were wicked sinners, even murderers, and were equally worthy of God’s wrath and eternal punishment. But Moses received mercy, while Pharaoh received God’s judgment, because that was God’s sovereign will (cf. <a ref='Romans 11:7'>11:7</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 11:18–20'>Jos 11:18–20</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:9'>1Th 5:9</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 2:12'>2Pe 2:12</a> ). <b>hardens.</b> The Greek word literally means to make something hard, but is often used figuratively to refer to making stubborn or obstinate. Ten times Exodus refers to God’s hardening Pharaoh’s heart (e.g., <a ref='Exodus 4:21'>4:21</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 7:3'>7:3</a> , <a ref='Exodus 7:13'>13</a> ), and other times to Pharaoh’s hardening his own heart (e.g., <a ref='Exodus 8:32'>8:32</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 9:34'>9:34</a> ). This does not mean that God actively created unbelief or some other evil in Pharaoh’s heart (cf. <a ref='James 1:13'>Jas 1:13</a> ), but rather that He withdrew all the divine influences that ordinarily acted as a restraint to sin and allowed Pharaoh’s wicked heart to pursue its sin unabated (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:24'>1:24</a> , <a ref='Romans 1:26'>26</a> , <a ref='Romans 1:28'>28</a> ). <a ref='Romans 9:19'>9:19</a> <b>Why does He still find fault?</b> The objection is: how can God blame anyone for sin and unbelief when He has sovereignly determined that person’s destiny? <a ref='Romans 9:20'>9:20</a> <b>who are you, O man, who answers back to God?</b> The nature of Paul’s reply makes it clear that he is not addressing those with honest questions about this difficult doctrine, but those who seek to use it to excuse their own sin and unbelief. <a ref='Romans 9:20–21'>9:20–21</a> Using the familiar OT analogy of the potter (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 64:6–8'>Is 64:6–8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 18:3–16'>Jer 18:3–16</a> ), Paul argues that it is as irrational, and far more arrogant, for men to question God’s choice of certain sinners for salvation, as for a piece of pottery to question the purposes of the potter. <a ref='Romans 9:22–23'>9:22–23</a> These verses are not intended to identify the origin of evil or explain fully why God has allowed it, but they do provide 3 reasons He has permitted its presence and contamination: 1) to demonstrate His wrath; 2) to make His power known; and 3) to put the riches of His glorious mercy on display. No one is treated unfairly: some receive the justice they earn and deserve ( <a ref='Romans 6:23'>6:23</a> ), others graciously receive mercy. <a ref='Romans 9:22'>9:22</a> <b>what if.</b> This introduces a statement of fact in the form of a rhetorical question. <b>wanting.</b> The Greek word speaks of divine intention, not passive resignation. <b>endured.</b> God could justly destroy sinners the first time they sin. But He patiently endures their rebellion rather than giving them what every sin immediately deserves: eternal punishment. <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 2:4'>2:4</a> .</i> <b>vessels of wrath.</b> Continuing the analogy of a potter, Paul refers to those whom God has not chosen for salvation, but rather allowed to incur the just penalty for their sin—God’s wrath ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 1:18'>1:18</a></i> ). <b>prepared for destruction.</b> By their own rejection of Him. God does not make men sinful, but He leaves them in the sin they have chosen ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 9:18'>18</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 9:23'>9:23</a> <b>glory.</b> The greatness of His character, seen especially in the grace, mercy, compassion, and forgiveness He grants sinners in Christ. <b>vessels of mercy.</b> Those He has chosen for salvation. <b>He prepared beforehand.</b> Refers to divine election ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 9:29'>29</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 9:25–33'>9:25–33</a> Paul finishes his argument that Israel’s unbelief is not inconsistent with God’s plan of redemption by using the OT to show that her unbelief reflects exactly what the prophets recorded (vv. <a ref='Romans 9:25–29'>25–29</a> ), and that it is consistent with God’s prerequisite of faith (vv. <a ref='Romans 9:30–33'>30–33</a> ). <a ref='Romans 9:25–26'>9:25–26</a> Paul quotes <a ref='Hosea 1:9–10'>Hos 1:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 2:23'>2:23</a> . Hosea spoke of the ultimate restoration of Israel to God, but Paul’s emphasis is that restoration necessarily implies her present alienation from God. Therefore, Israel’s unbelief is consistent with the OT revelation. <a ref='Romans 9:27–28'>9:27–28</a> See <a ref='Isaiah 10:22–23'>Is 10:22–23</a> . Isaiah prophesied that the southern kingdom of Judah would be conquered and scattered—temporarily rejected by God—because of her unbelief. Paul’s point is that the scattering Isaiah described was only a preview of Israel’s rejection of the Messiah and her subsequent destruction and scattering. <a ref='Romans 9:29'>9:29</a> See <a ref='Isaiah 1:9'>Is 1:9</a> . Again, only a remnant of Israel will survive God’s wrath, solely because of His mercy. Lord of Sabaoth <b>.</b> Cf. <a ref='James 5:4'>Jas 5:4</a> . This OT title for God is translated “Lord of hosts” and refers to His all-encompassing sovereignty. <a ref='Romans 9:30–32'>9:30–32</a> Paul concludes the lesson on God’s divine choice by reminding his readers that although God chooses some to receive His mercy, those who receive His judgment do so not because of something God has done to them, but because of their own unwillingness to believe the gospel (cf. <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:10'>2Th 2:10</a> ). Sinners are condemned for their personal sins, the supreme one being rejection of God and Christ (cf. <a ref='Romans 2:2–6'>2:2–6</a> , <a ref='Romans 2:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Romans 2:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='John 8:21–24'>Jn 8:21–24</a> ; <a ref='John 16:8–11'>16:8–11</a> ). <a ref='Romans 9:30'>9:30</a> <b>righteousness … by faith.</b> Righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 1:17'>1:17</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 9:31'>9:31</a> <b>law of righteousness.</b> Righteousness earned by keeping the law (cf. <a ref='Romans 3:20'>3:20</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 8:3'>8:3</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 9:32'>9:32</a> <b>not … by faith.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Romans 3:21–24'>3:21–24</a> .</i> <b>works.</b> By doing everything the law prescribed (cf. <a ref='Galatians 2:16'>Ga 2:16</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:2'>3:2</a> , <a ref='Galatians 3:5'>5</a> , <a ref='Galatians 3:10'>10</a> ). <a ref='Romans 9:33'>9:33</a> See <a ref='Isaiah 8:14'>Is 8:14</a> and <a ref='Isaiah 28:16'>28:16</a> . Long before His coming, the OT prophets had predicted that Israel would reject her Messiah, illustrating again that her unbelief is perfectly consistent with the Scripture. <a ref='Romans 10:1'>10:1</a> <b>prayer to God for them.</b> Paul’s calling as an apostle to the Gentiles ( <a ref='Romans 11:13'>11:13</a> ; <a ref='Acts 9:15'>Ac 9:15</a> ) did not diminish his continual entreaties to God (cf. <a ref='1 Timothy 2:1–3'>1Ti 2:1–3</a> ) for Israel to be saved (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:16'>1:16</a> ; <a ref='John 4:22'>Jn 4:22</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:8'>Ac 1:8</a> ), or his own evangelistic efforts toward Jews. <a ref='Romans 10:2'>10:2</a> <b>zeal for God.</b> Demonstrated by legalistic conformity to the law and fierce opposition to Judaism’s opponents ( <a ref='Acts 22:3'>Ac 22:3</a> ; <a ref='Acts 26:4–5'>26:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 1:13–14'>Ga 1:13–14</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:5–6'>Php 3:5–6</a> ). <a ref='Romans 10:3'>10:3</a> <b>not knowing about the righteousness of God.</b> Ignorant both of God’s inherent righteousness revealed in the law and the rest of the OT (which should have shown the Jews their own unrighteousness) and of the righteousness which comes from Him on the basis of faith ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 1:17'>1:17</a></i> ). <b>seeking … their own.</b> Based on their conformity to God’s law and often to the less demanding standards of their own traditions ( <a ref='Mark 7:1–13'>Mk 7:1–13</a> ). <a ref='Romans 10:4'>10:4</a> <b>Christ is the end of the law.</b> Although the Greek word translated “end” can mean either “fulfillment” or “termination,” this is not a reference to Christ’s having perfectly fulfilled the law through His teaching ( <a ref='Matthew 5:17–18'>Mt 5:17–18</a> ) or through His sinless life ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ). Instead, as the second half of the verse shows, Paul means that belief in Christ as Lord and Savior ends the sinner’s futile quest for righteousness through his imperfect attempts to save himself by efforts to obey the law (cf. <a ref='Romans 3:20–22'>3:20–22</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 64:6'>Is 64:6</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:13–14'>Col 2:13–14</a> ). <a ref='Romans 10:5'>10:5</a> <b>righteousness …</b> The man who does these things shall live by them <b>.</b> Quoted from <a ref='Leviticus 18:5'>Lv 18:5</a> .

His point is that the righteousness of faith does not require some impossible odyssey through the universe to find Christ. <a ref='Romans 10:8'>10:8</a> The word is near you <b>.</b> Quoted from <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:14'>Dt 30:14</a> . The journey of vv. <a ref='Romans 10:6–7'>6–7</a> is unnecessary because God has clearly revealed the way of salvation: it is by faith. <b>word of faith.</b> The message of faith is the way to God. <a ref='Romans 10:9'>10:9</a> <b>confess … Jesus</b> as <b>Lord.</b> Not a simple acknowledgment that He is God and the Lord of the universe, since even demons acknowledge that to be true ( <a ref='James 2:19'>Jas 2:19</a> ). This is the deep personal conviction, without reservation, that Jesus is that person’s own master or sovereign. This phrase includes repenting from sin, trusting in Jesus for salvation, and submitting to Him as Lord. This is the volitional element of faith ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 1:16'>1:16</a></i> ). <b>believe in your heart.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 1:16'>1:16</a> .</i> <b>God raised Him from the dead.</b> Christ’s resurrection was the supreme validation of His ministry (cf. <a ref='John 2:18–21'>Jn 2:18–21</a> ). Belief in it is necessary for salvation because it proved that Christ is who He claimed to be and that the Father had accepted His sacrifice in the place of sinners ( <a ref='Romans 4:24'>4:24</a> ; cf. <a ref='Acts 13:32–33'>Ac 13:32–33</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:3–4'>1Pe 1:3–4</a> ). Without the resurrection, there is no salvation ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:14–17'>1Co 15:14–17</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 1:4'>1:4</a> .</i> <b>will be saved.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 1:16'>1:16</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 10:10'>10:10</a> <b>confesses.</b> This Greek word basically means to say the same thing, or to be in agreement with someone. The person who confesses Jesus as Lord (v. <a ref='Romans 10:9'>9</a> ) agrees with the Father’s declaration that Jesus is Savior and Lord. <a ref='Romans 10:11'>10:11</a> Quoted from <a ref='Isaiah 28:16'>Is 28:16</a> and <a ref='Isaiah 49:23'>49:23</a> . This quotation not only demonstrates that salvation by grace through faith alone has always been God’s salvation plan, but that no one—including Gentiles—was ever to be excluded ( <a ref='Romans 1:16'>1:16</a> ; <a ref='Romans 3:21–22'>3:21–22</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 3:9'>2Pe 3:9</a> ; see also <a ref='Jonah 3:5'>Jon 3:5</a> ). <a ref='Romans 10:12'>10:12</a> <b>there is no distinction.</b> Cf. <a ref='Romans 3:22–23'>3:22–23</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:28–29'>Ga 3:28–29</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:11–13'>Eph 2:11–13</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 3:4–6'>3:4–6</a> . <a ref='Romans 10:13'>10:13</a> Paul quoted Joel ( <a ref='Joel 2:32'>2:32</a> ) to further emphasize that salvation is available for people of all nations and races. calls on the name <b>.</b> This familiar OT expression (e.g., <a ref='Psalms 79:5–6'>Pss 79:5–6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 105:1'>105:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 116:4–5'>116:4–5</a> ) does not refer to some desperate cry to just any deity, but to the one true God as He has revealed Himself—a revelation which now includes recognition of Jesus as Lord (v. <a ref='Romans 10:9'>9</a> ) and of the One who raised up Jesus from the dead (v. <a ref='Romans 10:9'>9</a> ). <a ref='Romans 10:14–15'>10:14–15</a> Paul’s main point in this series of rhetorical questions is that a clear presentation of the gospel message must precede true saving faith.

Since all things are for His glory, we must respond by offering ourselves for that purpose. <b>exhort.</b> This Greek word comes from a root which means “to call alongside to help.” Jesus used a related word, often translated “comforter,” in reference to the Holy Spirit ( <a ref='John 14:16'>Jn 14:16</a> , <a ref='John 14:26'>26</a> ; <a ref='John 15:26'>15:26</a> ; <a ref='John 16:7'>16:7</a> ). This family of words later came to connote exhorting, encouraging, or counseling. Paul was speaking as a counselor to his readers, but his counsel carried the full weight of his apostleship. <b>mercies of God.</b> The gracious, extravagant, divine graces Paul expounded in the first 11 chapters, including God’s love ( <a ref='Romans 1:7'>1:7</a> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 5:5'>5:5</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:35'>8:35</a> , <a ref='Romans 8:39'>39</a> ), grace ( <a ref='Romans 1:6–7'>1:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Romans 3:24'>3:24</a> ; <a ref='Romans 5:2'>5:2</a> , <a ref='Romans 5:20–21'>20–21</a> ; <a ref='Romans 6:15'>6:15</a> ), righteousness ( <a ref='Romans 1:17'>1:17</a> ; <a ref='Romans 3:21–22'>3:21–22</a> ; <a ref='Romans 4:5–6'>4:5–6</a> , <a ref='Romans 4:22–24'>22–24</a> ; <a ref='Romans 5:17'>5:17</a> , <a ref='Romans 5:19'>19</a> ), and the gift of faith ( <a ref='Romans 1:5'>1:5</a> , <a ref='Romans 1:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Romans 3:22'>3:22</a> , <a ref='Romans 3:26'>26</a> ; <a ref='Romans 4:5'>4:5</a> , <a ref='Romans 4:13'>13</a> ; <a ref='Romans 5:1'>5:1</a> ; <a ref='Romans 10:17'>10:17</a> ; <a ref='Romans 12:3'>12:3</a> ). <b>present your bodies as a sacrifice.</b> Under the Old Covenant, God accepted the sacrifices of dead animals. But because of Christ’s ultimate sacrifice, the OT sacrifices are no longer of any effect ( <a ref='Hebrews 9:11–12'>Heb 9:11–12</a> ). For those in Christ, the only acceptable worship is to offer themselves completely to the Lord. Under God’s control, the believer’s yet-unredeemed body ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 6:6'>6:6</a> , <a ref='Romans 6:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Romans 7:5'>7:5</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 8:11'>8:11</a> , <a ref='Romans 8:23'>23</a> ) can and must be yielded to Him as an instrument of righteousness ( <a ref='Romans 6:12–13'>6:12–13</a> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 8:11–13'>8:11–13</a> ). <b>spiritual service.</b> In light of all the spiritual riches believers enjoy solely as the fruit of God’s mercies ( <a ref='Romans 11:33'>Ro 11:33</a> , <a ref='Romans 11:36'>36</a> ), it logically follows that they owe God their highest form of service. Understood here is the idea of priestly, spiritual service, which was such an integral part of OT worship. <a ref='Romans 12:2'>12:2</a> <b>do not be conformed.</b> “Conformed” refers to assuming an outward expression that does not reflect what is really inside, a kind of masquerade or act. The word’s form implies that Paul’s readers were already allowing this to happen and must stop. <b>this world.</b> Better translated “age,” which refers to the system of beliefs, values—or the spirit of the age—at any time current in the world. This sum of contemporary thinking and values forms the moral atmosphere of our world and is always dominated by Satan (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:4'>2Co 4:4</a> ). <b>transformed.</b> The Greek word, from which the English word “metamorphosis” comes, connotes a change in outward appearance. Matthew uses the same word to describe the Transfiguration ( <a ref='Matthew 17:2'>Mt 17:2</a> ). Just as Christ briefly and in a limited way displayed outwardly His inner, divine nature and glory at the Transfiguration, Christians should outwardly manifest their inner, redeemed natures, not once, however, but daily (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 3:18'>2Co 3:18</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:18'>Eph 5:18</a> ). <b>renewing of your mind.</b> That kind of transformation can occur only as the Holy Spirit changes our thinking through consistent study and meditation of Scripture ( <a ref='Psalms 119:11'>Ps 119:11</a> ; cf. <a ref='Colossians 1:28'>Col 1:28</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 3:10'>3:10</a> , <a ref='Colossians 3:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 4:8'>Php 4:8</a> ). The renewed mind is one saturated with and controlled by the Word of God. <b>good … pleasing … perfect.</b> Holy living of which God approves. These words borrow from OT sacrificial language and describe a life that is morally and spiritually spotless, just as the sacrificial animals were to be (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 22:19–25'>Lv 22:19–25</a> ). <a ref='Romans 12:3'>12:3</a> <b>grace.</b> The divine, undeserved favor that called Paul to be an apostle and gave him spiritual authority ( <a ref='Romans 1:1–5'>Ro 1:1–5</a> ; cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:10'>1Co 3:10</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 2:9'>Ga 2:9</a> ) and also produced sincere humility ( <a ref='1 Timothy 1:12–14'>1Ti 1:12–14</a> ). <b>sound thinking.</b> The exercise of sound judgment, which will lead believers to recognize that in themselves they are nothing (cf. <a ref='1 Peter 5:5'>1Pe 5:5</a> ), and will yield the fruit of humility (cf. <a ref='3 John 1:9'>3Jn 9</a> ). <b>measure of faith.</b> The correct proportion of the spiritual gift—or supernatural endowment and ability—the Holy Spirit gives each believer ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 Peter 4:10'>1Pe 4:10</a></i> ) so he may fulfill his role in the body of Christ ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:7'>1Co 12:7</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:11'>11</a> ). “Faith” is not saving faith, but rather faithful stewardship, the kind and quantity required to use one’s own particular gift (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:7'>1Co 12:7</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:11'>11</a> ). Every believer receives the exact gift and resources he needs to fulfill his role in the body of Christ. <a ref='Romans 12:4–8'>12:4–8</a> One of two NT passages (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:12–14'>1Co 12:12–14</a> ) listing the general categories of spiritual gifts. The emphasis in each list is not on believers’ identifying their gift perfectly, but on faithfully using the unique enablement God has given each. The fact that the two lists differ clearly implies the gifts are like a palette of basic colors, from which God selects to blend a unique hue for each disciple’s life ( <i>see notes on vv. <a ref='Romans 12:6–8'>6–8</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:12–14'>1Co 12:12–14</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 12:4'>12:4</a> <b>many members … one body.</b> Just as in the natural body, God has sovereignly given the body of Christ a unified diversity ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:14–20'>1Co 12:14–20</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 12:5'>12:5</a> <b>in Christ.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Romans 8:1'>8:1</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:3–14'>Eph 1:3–14</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 12:6'>12:6</a> <b>gifts.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 12:3'>12:3</a> .</i> <b>according to the grace given.</b> Undeserved and unmerited ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 12:3'>3</a></i> ). The gift itself ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:4'>1Co 12:4</a> ), the specific way in which it is used ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:5'>1Co 12:5</a> ), and the spiritual results ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:6'>1Co 12:6</a> ) are all sovereignly chosen by the Spirit completely apart from personal merit ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:11'>1Co 12:11</a> ). <b>prophecy.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:10'>1Co 12:10</a> .</i> This Greek word means “speaking forth” and does not necessarily include prediction of the future or any other mystical or supernatural aspects. Although some prophets in Acts did make predictions of future events ( <a ref='Acts 11:27–28'>Ac 11:27–28</a> ; <a ref='Acts 21:10–11'>21:10–11</a> ), others made no predictions but spoke the truth of God to encourage and strengthen their hearers ( <a ref='Acts 15:32'>Ac 15:32</a> ; cf. vv. <a ref='Acts 15:22–31'>22–31</a> ). The evidence does suggest, however, that in the first century, before the NT was complete and the sign gifts had ceased ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 Corinthians 13:8–10'>1Co 13:8–10</a></i> ), this word may have had both nonrevelatory and revelatory facets. In its nonrevelatory sense, the word “prophecy” simply identifies the skill of public proclamation of the Word of God ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Corinthians 14:3'>1Co 14:3</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 14:24–25'>24–25</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 4:11'>1Pe 4:11</a></i> ). <b>in agreement with the faith.</b> Lit. “the faith,” or the full revealed message or body of Christian faith ( <a ref='Jude 1:3'>Jd 3</a> ; cf. <a ref='2 Timothy 4:2'>2Ti 4:2</a> ). The preacher must be careful to preach the same message the apostles delivered. Or, it could also refer to the believer’s personal understanding and insight regarding the gospel ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 12:3'>3</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 12:7'>12:7</a> <b>service.</b> From the same Greek word as “deacon,” “deaconess” come from, it refers to those who serve. This gift, similar to the gift of helps ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:28'>1Co 12:28</a> ), has broad application to include every kind of practical help (cf. <a ref='Acts 20:35'>Ac 20:35</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:28'>1Co 12:28</a> ). <b>teaching.</b> The ability to interpret, clarify, systematize, and explain God’s truth clearly (cf. <a ref='Acts 18:24–25'>Ac 18:24–25</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 2:2'>2Ti 2:2</a> ). Pastors must have the gift of teaching ( <a ref='1 Timothy 3:2'>1Ti 3:2</a> ; <a ref='Titus 1:9'>Tit 1:9</a> ; cf. <a ref='1 Timothy 4:16'>1Ti 4:16</a> ), but many mature, qualified laymen also have this gift. This differs from preaching (prophecy), not in content, but in the unique skill for public proclamation ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 12:6'>6</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 12:8'>12:8</a> <b>exhortation.</b> The gift which enables a believer to effectively call others to obey and follow God’s truth ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 12:1'>1</a></i> ). It may be used negatively to admonish and correct regarding sin ( <a ref='2 Timothy 4:2'>2Ti 4:2</a> ), or positively, to encourage, comfort, and strengthen struggling believers (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 1:3–5'>2Co 1:3–5</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:24–25'>Heb 10:24–25</a> ). <b>gives.</b> This denotes the sacrificial sharing and giving of one’s resources and self to meet the needs of others (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 8:3–5'>2Co 8:3–5</a> , <a ref='2 Corinthians 8:9'>9</a> , <a ref='2 Corinthians 8:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 4:28'>Eph 4:28</a> ). <b>generosity.</b> Simplicity, single-mindedness, and openhearted generosity. The believer who gives with a proper attitude does not do so for thanks and personal recognition, but to glorify God (cf. <a ref='Matthew 6:2'>Mt 6:2</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:44–45'>Ac 2:44–45</a> ; <a ref='Acts 4:37–5:11'>4:37—5:11</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 8:2–5'>2Co 8:2–5</a> ). <b>leads.</b> Lit. “standing before.” Paul calls this gift “administrations” ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:28'>1Co 12:28</a> ), a word that means “to guide” and is used of the person who steers a ship ( <a ref='Acts 27:11'>Ac 27:11</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 18:17'>Rev 18:17</a> ). In the NT, this word is used to describe only leadership in the home ( <a ref='1 Timothy 3:4–5'>1Ti 3:4–5</a> , <a ref='1 Timothy 3:12'>12</a> ) and the church ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:28'>1Co 12:28</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 5:17'>1Ti 5:17</a> ; cf. <a ref='Acts 27:11'>Ac 27:11</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 18:17'>Rev 18:17</a> ). Again, the church’s leaders must exercise this gift, but it is certainly not limited to them. <b>shows mercy.</b> One who actively shows sympathy and sensitivity to those in suffering and sorrow, and who has both the willingness and the resources to help lessen their afflictions. Frequently, this gift accompanies the gift of exhortation. <b>cheerfulness.</b> This attitude is crucial to ensure that the gift of mercy becomes a genuine help, not a discouraging commiseration with those who are suffering (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 14:21'>Pr 14:21</a> , <a ref='Proverbs 14:31'>31</a> ; <a ref='Luke 4:18–19'>Lk 4:18–19</a> ). <a ref='Romans 12:9–21'>12:9–21</a> This passage provides a comprehensive and mandatory list of traits that characterize the Spirit-filled life (cf. <a ref='John 15:8'>Jn 15:8</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:10'>Eph 2:10</a> ). Paul presents these characteristics under 4 categories: 1) personal duties (v. <a ref='Romans 12:9'>9</a> ); 2) family duties (vv. <a ref='Romans 12:10–13'>10–13</a> ); 3) duties to others (vv. <a ref='Romans 12:14–16'>14–16</a> ); and 4) duties to those who consider us enemies (vv. <a ref='Romans 12:17–21'>17–21</a> ). <a ref='Romans 12:9'>12:9</a> <b>love.</b> The supreme NT virtue, which centers completely on the needs and welfare of the one loved and does whatever necessary to meet those needs (cf. <a ref='Matthew 22:37–39'>Mt 22:37–39</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 5:22'>Ga 5:22</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 4:8'>1Pe 4:8</a> ; <a ref='1 John 4:16'>1Jn 4:16</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='1Co 13'>1Co 13</a></i> ). <b>hypocrisy.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 6:2'>Mt 6:2</a> .</i> Christian love is to be shown purely and sincerely, without self-centeredness or guile. <a ref='Romans 12:10'>12:10</a> <b>devoted … in brotherly love.</b> To be devoted to other Christians with a family sort of love, not based on personal attraction or desirability (cf. <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:9'>1Th 4:9</a> ). This quality is the primary way the world can recognize us as followers of Christ ( <a ref='John 13:35'>Jn 13:35</a> ; cf. <a ref='1 John 3:10'>1Jn 3:10</a> , <a ref='1 John 3:17–19'>17–19</a> ). <b>giving preference … in honor.</b> To show genuine appreciation and admiration for fellow believers by putting them first ( <a ref='Philippians 2:3'>Php 2:3</a> ). <a ref='Romans 12:11'>12:11</a> Whatever is worth doing in the Christian life is valuable enough to be done with enthusiasm and care ( <a ref='John 9:4'>Jn 9:4</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 6:10'>Ga 6:10</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 6:10–11'>Heb 6:10–11</a> ; cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:10'>Ecc 9:10</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 3:13'>2Th 3:13</a> ). Sloth and indifference not only prevent good, but allow evil to prosper ( <a ref='Proverbs 18:9'>Pr 18:9</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:15–16'>Eph 5:15–16</a> ). <b>fervent in spirit.</b> Lit. “to boil in spirit.” This phrase suggests having plenty of heat to produce adequate, productive energy, but not so much heat that one goes out of control (cf. <a ref='Acts 18:25'>Ac 18:25</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 9:26'>1Co 9:26</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 6:9'>Ga 6:9</a> ). <a ref='Romans 12:12'>12:12</a> <b>rejoicing in hope.</b> Of Christ’s return and our ultimate redemption ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 5:2'>5:2</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:19'>8:19</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 25:21'>Mt 25:21</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:58'>1Co 15:58</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 4:8'>2Ti 4:8</a> ). <b>persevering in affliction.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 5:3'>5:3</a> .</i> <b>devoted to prayer.</b> Cf. <a ref='Acts 2:42'>Ac 2:42</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:17'>1Th 5:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 2:8'>1Ti 2:8</a> . <a ref='Romans 12:13'>12:13</a> <b>contributing.</b> From a Greek word that means commonality, partnership, or mutual sharing, which is often translated “fellowship,” and “communion” ( <a ref='Acts 2:42'>Ac 2:42</a> , <a ref='Acts 2:44'>44</a> ; cf. <a ref='Acts 4:32'>4:32</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 6:17–18'>1Ti 6:17–18</a> ). <b>pursuing hospitality.</b> Lit. “pursuing the love of strangers” ( <a ref='Hebrews 13:2'>Heb 13:2</a> )—not merely entertaining one’s friends. In NT times, travel was dangerous and inns were evil, scarce, and expensive. So the early believers often opened their homes to travelers, especially to fellow believers ( <a ref='2 Timothy 1:16–18'>2Ti 1:16–18</a> ; <a ref='3 John 1:5–8'>3Jn 5–8</a> ; cf. <a ref='Luke 14:12–14'>Lk 14:12–14</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 4:9'>1Pe 4:9</a> ). Church leaders should be role models of this virtue ( <a ref='Titus 1:8'>Tit 1:8</a> ). <a ref='Romans 12:14'>12:14</a> <b>Bless those who persecute you.</b> Treat enemies as if they were your friends ( <a ref='Luke 6:27–33'>Lk 6:27–33</a> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:44'>Mt 5:44</a> ; <a ref='Luke 23:34'>Lk 23:34</a> ; <a ref='Acts 7:60'>Ac 7:60</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:21–23'>1Pe 2:21–23</a> ). <a ref='Romans 12:15'>12:15</a> <b>Rejoice … weep.</b> To be glad in the blessings, honor, and welfare of others—no matter what one’s own situation (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:26'>1Co 12:26</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 2:3'>2Co 2:3</a> ), and to be sensitive or compassionate to the hardships and sorrows of others ( <a ref='Colossians 3:12'>Col 3:12</a> ; <a ref='James 5:11'>Jas 5:11</a> ; cf. <a ref='Luke 19:41–44'>Lk 19:41–44</a> ; <a ref='John 11:35'>Jn 11:35</a> ). <a ref='Romans 12:16'>12:16</a> <b>same mind toward one another.</b> To be impartial ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 2:11'>2:11</a> ; <a ref='James 2:1–4'>Jas 2:1–4</a> , <a ref='James 2:9'>9</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Acts 10:34'>Ac 10:34</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 5:21'>1Ti 5:21</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:17'>1Pe 1:17</a> ). <b>not being haughty in mind.</b> To be haughty with self-seeking pride (cf. <a ref='Philippians 2:3'>Php 2:3</a> ). <b>wise in your own mind.</b> Christians are not to have conceit or feelings of superiority toward fellow believers (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:22'>1:22</a> ). <a ref='Romans 12:17'>12:17</a> <b>Never paying back evil for evil.</b> The OT law of “eye for eye, tooth for tooth” was never intended to be applied by individuals in the OT or NT; but it was a standard for the collective society to use to enforce good conduct among people ( <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:15'>1Th 5:15</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Exodus 21:23–24'>Ex 21:23–24</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Leviticus 24:20'>Lv 24:20</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:21'>Dt 19:21</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 3:8–9'>1Pe 3:8–9</a> ). <b>respecting what is good.</b> Christians are to respect what is intrinsically proper and honest and have the right behavior when they are around others, especially unbelievers. <a ref='Romans 12:18'>12:18</a> <b>if possible.</b> Although we should do everything possible to be at peace with others, it will not always come, because it also depends on others’ attitudes and responses. <a ref='Romans 12:19'>12:19</a> <b>wrath.</b> Of God ( <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 1:18'>1:18</a></i> ). Vengeance <b>.</b> Divine retribution as quoted from <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:35'>Dt 32:35</a> . <a ref='Romans 12:20'>12:20</a> heap burning coals on his head <b>.</b> Refers to an ancient Egyptian custom in which a person who wanted to show public contrition carried a pan of burning coals on his head. The coals represented the burning pain of his shame and guilt. When believers lovingly help their enemies, it should bring shame to such people for their hate and animosity (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 25:21–22'>Pr 25:21–22</a> ). <a ref='Romans 13:1'>13:1</a> <b>be in subjection.</b> This Greek word was used of a soldier’s absolute obedience to his superior officer. Scripture makes one exception to this command: when obedience to civil authority would require disobedience to God’s Word ( <a ref='Exodus 1:17'>Ex 1:17</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 3:16–18'>Da 3:16–18</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 6:7'>6:7</a> , <a ref='Daniel 6:10'>10</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 4:19'>Ac 4:19</a></i> ). <b>governing authorities.</b> Every position of civil authority without regard to competency, morality, reasonableness, or any other caveat ( <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:11–12'>1Th 4:11–12</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 2:1–2'>1Ti 2:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Titus 3:1–2'>Tit 3:1–2</a> ). <b>there is no authority except from God.</b> Since He alone is the sovereign ruler of the universe ( <a ref='Psalms 62:11'>Pss 62:11</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 103:19'>103:19</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 6:15'>1Ti 6:15</a> ), He has instituted 4 authorities on earth: 1) the government over all citizens; 2) the church over all believers; 3) the parents over all children; and 4) the masters over all employees. <b>appointed.</b> Human government’s authority derives from and is defined by God. He instituted human government to reward good and to restrain sin in an evil, fallen world. <a ref='Romans 13:2'>13:2</a> <b>opposed the ordinance of God.</b> Since all government is God-ordained, disobedience is rebellion against God. However, God has not granted civic rulers authority over the doctrine, practice, or polity of the church. <b>condemnation.</b> Not God’s judgment, but punishment from the government for breaking the law ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 13:4'>4</a></i> ). <a ref='Romans 13:3'>13:3</a> <b>not</b> a cause of <b>fear for good behavior, but for evil.</b> Even the most wicked, godless governments act as a deterrent to crime. <b>Do what is good … have praise.</b> Peaceful, law-abiding citizens need not fear the authorities. Few governments will harm those who obey their laws. In fact, governments usually commend such people. <a ref='Romans 13:4'>13:4</a> <b>minister of God … for good.</b> By helping restrain evil and protecting life and property. Paul took advantage of his government’s role in promoting what is good when he exercised his rights as a Roman citizen to obtain justice ( <a ref='Acts 16:37'>Ac 16:37</a> ; <a ref='Acts 22:25'>22:25</a> , <a ref='Acts 22:29'>29</a> ; <a ref='Acts 25:11'>25:11</a> ). <b>bear the sword.</b> This symbolizes the government’s right to inflict punishment on wrongdoers—especially capital punishment ( <a ref='Genesis 9:6'>Ge 9:6</a> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 26:52'>Mt 26:52</a> ; <a ref='Acts 25:11'>Ac 25:11</a> ). <b>brings wrath.</b> Not God’s wrath, but the punishment inflicted by the civil authorities. <a ref='Romans 13:5'>13:5</a> <b>be in subjection.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Romans 13:1'>1</a> .</i> <b>because of conscience.</b> Out of a sense of obligation to God and to keep a clear conscience before Him ( <i>see note on <a ref='2 Corinthians 1:12'>2Co 1:12</a></i> ), not merely to avoid punishment from the civil authorities. <a ref='Romans 13:6'>13:6</a> <b>because of this.</b> Because God ordained human government and demands submission to it (vv. <a ref='Romans 13:1–5'>1–5</a> ). <b>taxes.</b> The Greek word referred specifically to taxes paid by individuals, particularly those living in a conquered nation to their foreign rulers—which makes the tax even more onerous. That tax was usually a combined income and property tax. In this context, however, Paul uses the term in the broadest possible sense to speak of all kinds of taxes. Jesus explicitly taught that taxes are to be paid—even to the pagan Roman government ( <a ref='Matthew 22:17–21'>Mt 22:17–21</a> ).

Yet Satan often works on man’s unredeemed flesh to create division and threaten that unity. The threat to unity Paul addresses in this passage arises when mature (strong) believers—both Jews and Gentiles—conflict with immature (weak) believers. The strong Jewish believers understood their freedom in Christ and realized the ceremonial requirements of the Mosaic law were no longer binding. The mature Gentiles understood that idols are not gods and, therefore, that they could eat meat that had been offered to them. But in both cases the weaker brothers’ consciences were troubled, and they were even tempted to violate their consciences (a bad thing to train oneself to do). Knowing that the mature Jews and Gentiles would be able to understand these struggles, Paul addresses most of his comments to them. <a ref='Romans 14:1'>14:1</a> <b>accept.</b> The Greek word refers to personal and willing acceptance of another. <b>weak in faith.</b> This characterizes those believers who are unable to let go of the religious ceremonies and rituals of their past. The weak Jewish believer had difficulty abandoning the rites and prohibitions of the Old Covenant; he felt compelled to adhere to dietary laws, observe the Sabbath, and offer sacrifices in the temple. The weak Gentile believer had been steeped in pagan idolatry and its rituals; he felt that any contact with anything remotely related to his past, including eating meat that had been offered to a pagan deity and then sold in the marketplace, tainted him with sin. Both had very sensitive consciences in these areas, and were not yet mature enough to be free of those convictions. Cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 8:1–13'>1Co 8:1–13</a> . <b>passing judgment on opinions.</b> The mature believer should not sit in judgment on the sincere but underdeveloped thoughts that govern the weak believer’s conduct. <a ref='Romans 14:2'>14:2</a> <b>One … has faith.</b> The strong believer, whose mature faith allows him to exercise his freedom in Christ by eating the inexpensive meat sold at the pagan meat markets—inexpensive because a worshiper had first offered it as a sacrifice to a pagan deity ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Corinthians 8:1–13'>1Co 8:1–13</a></i> ). <b>vegetables</b> only <b>.</b> The strict diet weak Jewish and Gentile believers ate to avoid eating meat that was unclean or may have been sacrificed to idols. <a ref='Romans 14:3'>14:3</a> <b>view … with contempt … judge.</b> To “view with contempt” is to consider someone as worthless. “Judge” is equally strong and means “to condemn.” Paul uses them synonymously: the strong hold the weak in contempt as legalistic and self-righteous; the weak judge the strong to be irresponsible at best and perhaps depraved. <a ref='Romans 14:4'>14:4</a> <b>To his own master he stands or falls.</b> How Christ evaluates each believer is what matters, and His judgment does not take into account religious tradition or personal preference (cf. <a ref='Romans 8:33–34'>8:33–34</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 4:3–5'>1Co 4:3–5</a> ). <a ref='Romans 14:5'>14:5</a> <b>judges one day.</b> Though it was no longer required by God, the weak Jewish believer felt compelled to observe the Sabbath and other special days associated with Judaism (cf. <a ref='Galatians 4:9–10'>Ga 4:9–10</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Colossians 2:16–17'>Col 2:16–17</a></i> ). On the other hand, the weak Gentile wanted to separate himself from the special days of festivities associated with his former paganism because of its immorality and idolatry. <b>judges every day</b> alike. The mature believers were unaffected by those concerns. <b>Each … must be fully convinced.</b> Each Christian must follow the dictates of his own conscience in matters not specifically commanded or prohibited in Scripture. Since conscience is a God-given mechanism to warn, and responds to the highest standard of moral law in the mind ( <a ref='Romans 2:14–15'>2:14–15</a> ), it is not sensible to train yourself to ignore it. Rather, respond to its compunctions, and as you mature, by learning more, your mind will not alert it to those things which are not essential. <a ref='Romans 14:6'>14:6</a> The strong believer eats whatever he pleases and thanks the Lord. The weak brother eats according to his ceremonial diet and thanks the Lord that he made a sacrifice on His behalf. In either case, the believer thanks the Lord, so the motive is the same. <b>for the Lord.</b> Whether weak or strong, the motive behind a believer’s decisions about issues of conscience must be to please the Lord. <a ref='Romans 14:7'>14:7</a> <b>lives for himself … dies for himself.</b> The focus of Christian living is never oneself—everything we do should be to please our sovereign Lord (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:20'>1Co 6:20</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:31'>10:31</a> ). <a ref='Romans 14:9'>14:9</a> <b>Lord both of the dead and of the living.</b> Christ died not only to free us from sin, but to enslave us to Himself ( <a ref='Romans 6:22'>6:22</a> ); to establish Himself as Sovereign over the saints in His presence and those still on earth (cf. <a ref='Philippians 2:11'>Php 2:11</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 6:15'>1Ti 6:15</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 17:14'>Rev 17:14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:16'>19:16</a> ). <a ref='Romans 14:10'>14:10</a> <b>judge … with contempt.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Romans 14:3'>3</a> .</i> <b>your brother.</b> A fellow believer in Christ. <b>the judgment seat of God.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:13–15'>1Co 3:13–15</a> .</i> Every believer will give an account of himself, and the Lord will judge the decisions he made—including those concerning issues of conscience.

In v. <a ref='Romans 14:13'>13b</a> , the meaning is positive: to determine or make a careful decision. The point of Paul’s play on words is that instead of passing judgment on their brothers, they should use their best judgment to help fellow believers. <b>stumbling block.</b> Anything a believer does—even though Scripture may permit it—that causes another to fall into sin ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 8:9'>1Co 8:9</a> ). <a ref='Romans 14:14'>14:14</a> <b>I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus.</b> This truth was not the product of Paul’s own thinking or the teaching of others, but of divine revelation (cf. <a ref='Galatians 1:12'>Ga 1:12</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='1 Corinthians 7:12'>1Co 7:12</a> .</i> <b>nothing is defiled in itself.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 10:15'>Ac 10:15</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Mark 7:15'>Mk 7:15</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 4:3–5'>1Ti 4:3–5</a> ; <a ref='Titus 1:15'>Tit 1:15</a> . <b>unclean.</b> The Greek word originally meant “common” but came to mean “impure” or “evil” ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 10:14'>Ac 10:14</a></i> ). <b>to him who considers … to him it is defiled.</b> If a believer is convinced a certain behavior is sin—even if his assessment is wrong—he should never do it.

A weak believer may be hurt when he sees a brother do something he believes is sinful. But still worse, the strong believer may cause his weaker brother to violate his own conscience (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 8:8–13'>1Co 8:8–13</a> ). <b>love.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Corinthians 13:1–13'>1Co 13:1–13</a> .</i> Love will ensure that the strong Christian is sensitive and understanding of his brother’s weaknesses ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 8:8–13'>1Co 8:8–13</a> ). <b>destroy.</b> This refers to complete devastation.

Paul’s description of the benefits of Scripture certainly includes the NT, but speaks primarily about “the sacred writings”—or the OT ( <a ref='2 Timothy 3:15–17'>2Ti 3:15–17</a> ). <b>perseverance.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 5:3'>5:3</a> .</i> <b>encouragement.</b> The Word of God not only informs believers how to endure, but it also encourages them in the process. <b>hope.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 5:2'>5:2</a> .</i> Without the clear and certain promises of the Word of God, the believer has no basis for hope (cf. <a ref='Psalms 119:81'>Ps 119:81</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:114'>114</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:12'>Eph 2:12</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 14:8'>Jer 14:8</a> ). <a ref='Romans 15:5'>15:5</a> <b>to be of the same mind with one another.</b> Paul urges the strong and the weak ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 14:1–13'>14:1–13</a></i> ), despite their differing views on these nonessential issues, to pursue loving, spiritual harmony in regard to matters on which the Bible is silent. <a ref='Romans 15:6'>15:6</a> <b>with one accord … one voice.</b> Our unity should be both real (“one accord”) and apparent (“one voice”). But the consummate purpose of unity is not to please other believers but to glorify God. <b>God and Father.</b> This expression emphasizes the deity of Christ.

Every believer is responsible to encourage and strengthen other believers with God’s Word and is divinely equipped to do so ( <a ref='2 Timothy 3:16'>2Ti 3:16</a> ). <a ref='Romans 15:15'>15:15</a> <b>as to remind you.</b> In spite of their spiritual strength, these Christians needed to be reminded of truths they already knew but could easily neglect or even forget (cf. <a ref='1 Timothy 4:6'>1Ti 4:6</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 2:8–14'>2Ti 2:8–14</a> ; <a ref='Titus 3:1'>Tit 3:1</a> ). <a ref='Romans 15:16'>15:16</a> <b>minister.</b> “Minister” was a general Greek term used of public officials.

In Paul’s day, this area was more commonly known as Dalmatia ( <a ref='2 Timothy 4:10'>2Ti 4:10</a> ).

But for pastor-teachers, building on the foundation laid by such an evangelist is the crucial part of their ministry (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:6'>1Co 3:6</a> ). <a ref='Romans 15:21'>15:21</a> <b>it is written.</b> Quoted from <a ref='Isaiah 52:15'>Is 52:15</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Romans 3:10'>3:10</a></i> . The OT quotation refers primarily to Christ’s second coming, but in its broader application it refers to the process of evangelism that began in Paul’s day and continues throughout church history until Christ returns. <a ref='Romans 15:22'>15:22</a> <b>prevented from coming.</b> The form of this Greek verb indicates an ongoing problem, and that something external created the hindrance. Paul was providentially being prevented by God from going to Rome (cf. <a ref='Acts 16:7'>Ac 16:7</a> ). <a ref='Romans 15:23–24'>15:23–24</a> Careful and sensible planning does not demonstrate a lack of trust in God’s providence. But plans must always be subject to the Lord’s control and alteration—just as Paul’s were (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 16:9'>Pr 16:9</a> ). <a ref='Romans 15:23'>15:23</a> <b>no further place.</b> Paul believed he had covered the region with the gospel sufficiently and could move on to other areas. <b>a longing to come to you.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Romans 1:10–13'>1:10–13</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 15:24'>15:24</a> <b>Spain.</b> The city and region referred to in the OT as Tarshish ( <a ref='1 Kings 10:22'>1Ki 10:22</a> ; <a ref='Jonah 1:3'>Jon 1:3</a> ), located on the far western end of the European continent. It had become a major center of commerce and culture, made accessible by the vast network of Roman roads.

Aware of the trouble that awaited him ( <a ref='Acts 20:22–24'>Ac 20:22–24</a> ), he wanted the Roman Christians to pray for his deliverance only so he could complete the ministry the Lord had given him. Their prayers were answered in that he met with success in Jerusalem ( <a ref='Acts 21:17'>Ac 21:17</a> , <a ref='Acts 21:19–20'>19–20</a> ) and was delivered from death, but not imprisonment ( <a ref='Acts 21:10–11'>Ac 21:10–11</a> ; <a ref='Acts 23:11'>23:11</a> ). <a ref='Romans 15:31'>15:31</a> <b>may prove acceptable.</b> Paul wanted the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem to receive the financial gift from the Gentiles with loving gratitude, recognizing it as a gesture of brotherly love and kindness. <a ref='Romans 15:32'>15:32</a> <b>the will of God.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 1:10'>1:10</a> .</i> <b>find rest in your company.</b> Paul eventually found the joy and rest he was looking for ( <a ref='Acts 28:15'>Ac 28:15</a> ). <a ref='Romans 15:33'>15:33</a> <b>the God of peace.</b> Just as He is the God of hope ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Romans 15:13'>13</a></i> ), God is also the source of true peace (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 2:11–14'>Eph 2:11–14</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 4:7'>Php 4:7</a> ). <a ref='Romans 16:1–27'>16:1–27</a> This chapter, which has almost no explicit teaching and contains several lists of mostly unknown people, is the most extensive and intimate expression of Paul’s love and affection for other believers and coworkers found anywhere in his NT letters. It also provides insights into the lives of ordinary first-century Christians and gives an inside look at the nature and character of the early church. <a ref='Romans 16:1'>16:1</a> <b>Phoebe.</b> Means “bright and radiant,” which aptly fits Paul’s brief description of her personality and Christian character. <b>servant.</b> The term from which we get “deacon” and “deaconess” ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Timothy 3:10–12'>1Ti 3:10–12</a></i> ). In the early church, women servants cared for sick believers, the poor, strangers, and those in prison. They instructed the women and children (cf. <a ref='Titus 2:3–5'>Tit 2:3–5</a> ). Whether Phoebe had an official title or not, she had the great responsibility of delivering this letter to the Roman church. When they had served faithfully and become widowed and destitute, such women were to be cared for by the church ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Timothy 5:3–16'>1Ti 5:3–16</a></i> ). <b>Cenchrea.</b> A neighboring port city of Corinth, where Paul wrote Romans. The church in Cenchrea was probably planted by the Corinthian church. <a ref='Romans 16:3'>16:3</a> <b>Prisca and Aquila.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Acts 18:1–3'>Ac 18:1–3</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 16:4'>16:4</a> <b>for my life risked their own necks.</b> Probably at Corinth or Ephesus, but the details are not known. <a ref='Romans 16:5'>16:5</a> <b>Epaenetus.</b> Probably saved through Paul’s preaching and lovingly discipled by the apostle. <b>first convert.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 1:13'>1:13</a> .</i> He was the first convert in Asia Minor (modern Turkey). <a ref='Romans 16:6'>16:6</a> <b>Mary, who has labored much for you.</b> “Labored much” connotes hard labor to the point of exhaustion. The context suggests she might have ministered in the church at Rome since its founding and been mentioned to Paul by others (possibly Prisca and Aquila). But nothing more is known of her. <a ref='Romans 16:7'>16:7</a> <b>Andronicus and Junia.</b> Perhaps a married couple, since “Junia” can be a woman’s name. <b>fellow prisoners.</b> Probably a reference to their actually sharing the same cell or adjacent cells at some point. <b>outstanding to the apostles.</b> Their ministry with Paul, and perhaps with Peter and some of the other apostles in Jerusalem before Paul was converted, was well known and appreciated by the apostles. <a ref='Romans 16:8'>16:8</a> <b>Ampliatus.</b> A common name among the emperor’s household slaves at that time; he may have been one of those in “Caesar’s household” ( <a ref='Philippians 4:22'>Php 4:22</a> ). <a ref='Romans 16:9'>16:9</a> <b>Stachys.</b> An uncommon Greek name meaning “ear of corn.” He was obviously close to Paul, but the details are unknown. <a ref='Romans 16:10'>16:10</a> <b>Aristobulus.</b> Since Paul does not greet him personally, he was probably not a believer, although some relatives and household servants apparently were. One noted biblical scholar believes that he was the brother of Herod Agrippa I and the grandson of Herod the Great. <a ref='Romans 16:11'>16:11</a> <b>Herodion.</b> Related to the Herod family, and so perhaps associated with the household of Aristobulus. <b>my kinsman.</b> He may have been one of Paul’s Jewish relatives. <b>Narcissus.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 16:10'>16:10</a> .</i> Some scholars believe that this was the Emperor Claudius’ secretary. If so, two households within the palace had Christians in them (cf. <a ref='Philippians 4:22'>Php 4:22</a> ). <a ref='Romans 16:12'>16:12</a> <b>Tryphaena and Tryphosa.</b> Possibly twin sisters, whose names mean “delicate” and “dainty.” <b>Persis.</b> Named after her native Persia; since her work is spoken of in the past tense, she was probably older than the other two women in this verse. <a ref='Romans 16:13'>16:13</a> <b>Rufus.</b> Biblical scholars generally agree that he was one of the sons of Simon of Cyrene, the man enlisted to carry Jesus’ cross (cf. <a ref='Mark 15:21'>Mk 15:21</a> ) and was likely saved through that contact with Christ. Mark wrote his Gospel in Rome, possibly after the letter to Rome was written, and circulated. Paul would not have mentioned Rufus if that name were not well known to the church in Rome. <b>choice man in the Lord.</b> Elected to salvation. This indicates he was widely known as an extraordinary believer because of his great love and service. <b>his mother and mine.</b> Rufus was not Paul’s natural brother. Rather, Rufus’ mother, the wife of Simon of Cyrene, at some time had cared for Paul during his ministry travels. <a ref='Romans 16:14–15'>16:14–15</a> “Brothers” in this context, probably refers to both men and women, which indicates that these names represent the outstanding leaders of two of the assemblies in Rome. <a ref='Romans 16:16'>16:16</a> <b>holy kiss.</b> Kissing of friends on the forehead, cheek, or beard was common in the OT. The Jews in the NT church carried on the practice, and it became especially precious to new believers, who were often outcasts from their own families because of their faith, because of the spiritual kinship it signified. <a ref='Romans 16:17–20'>16:17–20</a> Paul considered it necessary to insert into his greetings of love this caution against harmful teachings and practices that undermine the truth of Christianity and are its greatest threat. Genuine love will be ready to forgive evil, but it will not condone or ignore it.
