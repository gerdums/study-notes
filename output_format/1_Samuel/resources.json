    "content": "The First and Second Books of Samuel Title First and Second Samuel were considered as one book in the earliest Hebrew manuscripts, and were later divided into the two books by the translators of the Greek version, the Septuagint (LXX), a division followed by the Latin Vulgate (Vg.), English translations, and modern Hebrew Bibles. The earliest Hebrew manuscripts entitled the one book “Samuel” after the man God used to establish the kingship in Israel. Later Hebrew texts and the English versions call the divided book “1 and 2 Samuel.” The LXX designated them “The First and Second Books of Kingdoms” and the Vg., “First and Second Kings,” with our 1 and 2 Kings being “Third and Fourth Kings.” Author and Date Jewish tradition ascribed the writing of “Samuel” to Samuel himself or to Samuel, Nathan, and Gad (based on <a ref='1 Chronicles 29:29'>1Chr 29:29</a> ). But Samuel cannot be the writer because his death is recorded in <a ref='1 Samuel 25:1'>1Sa 25:1</a> , before the events associated with David’s reign even took place. Further, Nathan and Gad were prophets of the Lord during David’s lifetime and would not have been alive when the book of Samuel was written. Though the written records of these 3 prophets could have been used for information in the writing of 1 and 2 Samuel, the human author of these books is unknown. The work comes to the reader as an anonymous writing, i.e., the human author speaks for the Lord and gives the divine interpretation of the events narrated. The books of Samuel contain no clear indication of the date of composition. That the author wrote after the division of the kingdom between Israel and Judah in 931 BC is clear, due to the many references to Israel and Judah as distinct entities ( <a ref='1 Samuel 11:8'>1Sa 11:8</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 17:52'>17:52</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 18:16'>18:16</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 5:5'>2Sa 5:5</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 11:11'>11:11</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 12:8'>12:8</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 19:42–43'>19:42–43</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 24:1'>24:1</a> , <a ref='2 Samuel 24:9'>9</a> ). Also, the statement concerning Ziklag’s belonging “to the kings of Judah to this day” in <a ref='1 Samuel 27:6'>1Sa 27:6</a> gives clear evidence of a post-Solomonic date of writing. There is no such clarity concerning how late the date of writing could be. However, 1 and 2 Samuel are included in the Former Prophets in the Hebrew canon, along with Joshua, Judges, and 1 and 2 Kings. If the Former Prophets were composed as a unit, then Samuel would have been written during the Babylonian captivity (ca. 560–540 BC), since 2 Kings concludes during the exile ( <a ref='2 Kings 25:27–30'>2Ki 25:27–30</a> ). However, since Samuel has a different literary style than Kings, it was most likely penned before the Exile during the period of the divided kingdom (ca. 931–722 BC) and later made an integral part of the Former Prophets. Background and Setting The majority of the action recorded in 1 and 2 Samuel took place in and around the central highlands in the land of Israel. The nation of Israel was largely concentrated in an area that ran about 90 mi. from the hill country of Ephraim in the north ( <a ref='1 Samuel 1:1'>1Sa 1:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 9:4'>9:4</a> ) to the hill country of Judah in the south ( <a ref='Joshua 20:7'>Jos 20:7</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 21:11'>21:11</a> ) and between 15 to 35 mi. east to west. This central spine ranges in height from 1,500 ft. to 3,300 ft. above sea level. The major cities of 1 and 2 Samuel are to be found in these central highlands: Shiloh, the residence of Eli and the tabernacle; Ramah, the hometown of Samuel; Gibeah, the headquarters of Saul; Bethlehem, the birthplace of David; Hebron, David’s capital when he ruled over Judah; and Jerusalem, the ultimate “city of David.” The events of 1 and 2 Samuel took place between the years ca. 1105 BC, the birth of Samuel ( <a ref='1 Samuel 1:1–28'>1Sa 1:1–28</a> ), to ca. 971 BC, the last words of David ( <a ref='2 Samuel 23:1–7'>2Sa 23:1–7</a> ). Thus, the books span about 135 years of history. During those years, Israel was transformed from a loosely knit group of tribes under “judges” to a united nation under the reign of a centralized monarchy. They look primarily at Samuel (ca. 1105–1030 BC), Saul who reigned ca. 1052–1011 BC, and David who was king of the united monarchy ca. 1011–971 BC. Historical and Theological Themes As 1 Samuel begins, Israel was at a low point spiritually. The priesthood was corrupt ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:12–17'>1Sa 2:12–17</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 2:22–26'>22–26</a> ), the ark of the covenant was not at the tabernacle ( <a ref='1 Samuel 4:3–7:2'>1Sa 4:3—7:2</a> ), idolatry was practiced ( <a ref='1 Samuel 7:3–4'>1Sa 7:3–4</a> ), and the judges were dishonest ( <a ref='1 Samuel 8:2–3'>1Sa 8:2–3</a> ). Through the influence of godly Samuel ( <a ref='1 Samuel 12:23'>1Sa 12:23</a> ) and David ( <a ref='1 Samuel 13:14'>1Sa 13:14</a> ), these conditions were reversed. Second Samuel concludes with the anger of the Lord being withdrawn from Israel ( <a ref='2 Samuel 24:25'>2Sa 24:25</a> ). During the years narrated in 1 and 2 Samuel, the great empires of the ancient world were in a state of weakness. Neither Egypt nor the Mesopotamian powers, Babylon and Assyria, were threats to Israel at that time. The two nations most hostile to the Israelites were the Philistines ( <a ref='1Sa 4'>1Sa 4</a> ; <a ref='1Sa 7'>7</a> ; <a ref='1Sa 13'>13</a> ; <a ref='1Sa 14'>14</a> ; <a ref='1Sa 17'>17</a> ; <a ref='1Sa 23'>23</a> ; <a ref='1Sa 31'>31</a> ; <a ref='2Sa 5'>2Sa 5</a> ) to the west and the Ammonites ( <a ref='1Sa 11'>1Sa 11</a> ; <a ref='2Sa 10-12'>2Sa 10–12</a> ) to the east. The major contingent of the Philistines had migrated from the Aegean Islands and Asia Minor in the 12th century BC. After being denied access to Egypt, they settled among other preexisting Philistines along the Mediterranean coast of Canaan. The Philistines controlled the use of iron, which gave them a decided military and economic advantage over Israel ( <a ref='1 Samuel 13:19–22'>1Sa 13:19–22</a> ). The Ammonites were descendants of Lot ( <a ref='Genesis 19:38'>Ge 19:38</a> ) who lived on the Transjordan Plateau. David conquered the Philistines ( <a ref='2 Samuel 8:1'>2Sa 8:1</a> ) and the Ammonites ( <a ref='2 Samuel 12:29–31'>2Sa 12:29–31</a> ), along with other nations that surrounded Israel ( <a ref='2 Samuel 8:2–14'>2Sa 8:2–14</a> ). There are four predominant theological themes in 1 and 2 Samuel. The first is the Davidic Covenant. The books are literarily framed by two references to the “anointed” king in the prayer of Hannah ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:10'>1Sa 2:10</a> ) and the song of David ( <a ref='2 Samuel 22:51'>2Sa 22:51</a> ). This is a reference to the Messiah, the King who will triumph over the nations who are opposed to God (see <a ref='Genesis 49:8–12'>Ge 49:8–12</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 24:7–9'>Nu 24:7–9</a> , <a ref='Numbers 24:17–19'>17–19</a> ). According to the Lord’s promise, this Messiah will come through the line of David and establish David’s throne forever ( <a ref='2 Samuel 7:12–16'>2Sa 7:12–16</a> ). The events of David’s life recorded in Samuel foreshadow the actions of David’s greater Son (i.e., Christ) in the future. A second theme is the sovereignty of God, clearly seen in these books. One example is the birth of Samuel in response to Hannah’s prayer ( <a ref='1 Samuel 9:17'>1Sa 9:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 16:12–13'>16:12–13</a> ). Also, in relation to David, it is particularly evident that nothing can frustrate God’s plan to have him rule over Israel ( <a ref='1 Samuel 24:20'>1Sa 24:20</a> ). Third, the work of the Holy Spirit in empowering men for divinely appointed tasks is evident. The Spirit of the Lord came upon both Saul and David after their anointing as king ( <a ref='1 Samuel 10:10'>1Sa 10:10</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 16:13'>16:13</a> ). The power of the Holy Spirit brought forth prophecy ( <a ref='1 Samuel 10:6'>1Sa 10:6</a> ) and victory in battle ( <a ref='1 Samuel 11:6'>1Sa 11:6</a> ). Fourth, the books of Samuel demonstrate the personal and national effects of sin. The sins of Eli and his sons resulted in their deaths ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:12–17'>1Sa 2:12–17</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 2:22–25'>22–25</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 3:10–14'>3:10–14</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 4:17–18'>4:17–18</a> ). The lack of reverence for the ark of the covenant led to the death of a number of Israelites ( <a ref='1 Samuel 6:19'>1Sa 6:19</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 6:6–7'>2Sa 6:6–7</a> ). Saul’s disobedience resulted in the Lord’s judgment, and he was rejected as king over Israel ( <a ref='1 Samuel 13:9'>1Sa 13:9</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 13:13–14'>13–14</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 15:8–9'>15:8–9</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 15:20–23'>20–23</a> ). Although David was forgiven for his sin of adultery and murder after his confession ( <a ref='2 Samuel 12:13'>2Sa 12:13</a> ), he still suffered the inevitable and devastating consequences of his sin ( <a ref='2 Samuel 12:14'>2Sa 12:14</a> ). Interpretive Challenges The books of Samuel contain a number of interpretive issues that have been widely discussed: 1) Which of the ancient mss. is closest to the original autograph? The standard Hebrew (Masoretic) text has been relatively poorly preserved, and the LXX often differs from it. Thus, the exact reading of the original autograph of the text is in places hard to determine (see <a ref='1 Samuel 13:1'>1Sa 13:1</a> ). The Masoretic text will be assumed to represent the original text unless there is a grammatical or contextual impossibility. This accounts for many of the numerical discrepancies. 2) Is Samuel ambivalent to the establishment of the human kingship in Israel? It is claimed that while <a ref='1Sa 9-11'>1Sa 9–11</a> presents a positive view of the kingship, <a ref='1Sa 8'>1Sa 8</a> and <a ref='1Sa 12'>12</a> are strongly anti-monarchial. It is preferable, however, to see the book as presenting a balanced perspective of the human kingship. While the desire of Israel for a king was acceptable ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:15'>Dt 17:15</a> ), their reason for wanting a king showed a lack of faith in the Lord ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Samuel 8:5'>1Sa 8:5</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 8:20'>20</a></i> ). 3) How does one explain the bizarre behavior of the prophets? It is commonly held that 1 and 2 Samuel present the prophets as ecstatic speakers with bizarre behavior just like the pagan prophets of the other nations. But there is nothing in the text which is inconsistent with seeing the prophets as communicators of divine revelation, at times prophesying with musical accompaniment ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Samuel 10:5'>1Sa 10:5</a></i> ; <i><a ref='1 Samuel 19:23–24'>19:23–24</a></i> ). 4) How did the Holy Spirit minister before Pentecost? The ministry of the Holy Spirit in <a ref='1 Samuel 10:6'>1Sa 10:6</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 10:10'>10</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 11:6'>11:6</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 16:13–14'>16:13–14</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 19:20'>19:20</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 19:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 23:2'>2Sa 23:2</a> was not describing salvation in the NT sense, but an empowering by the Lord for His service (see also <a ref='Judges 3:10'>Jdg 3:10</a> ; <a ref='Judges 6:34'>6:34</a> ; <a ref='Judges 11:29'>11:29</a> ; <a ref='Judges 13:25'>13:25</a> ; <a ref='Judges 14:6'>14:6</a> , <a ref='Judges 14:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Judges 15:14'>15:14</a> ). 5) What was the identity of the “distressing spirit”? Is it a personal being, i.e., a demon, or a spirit of discontent created by God in the heart (cf. <a ref='Judges 9:23'>Jdg 9:23</a> )? Traditionally, it has been viewed as a demon ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 Samuel 16:14'>1Sa 16:14</a></i> ). 6) How did Samuel appear in <a ref='1 Samuel 28:3–5'>1Sa 28:3–5</a> ? It seems best to understand the appearance of Samuel as the Lord allowing the dead Samuel to speak with Saul. 7) What is the identity of David’s seed in <a ref='2 Samuel 7:12–15'>2Sa 7:12–15</a> ? It is usually taken as Solomon. However, the NT refers the words to Jesus, God’s Son in <a ref='Hebrews 1:5'>Heb 1:5</a> ( <i>see notes on <a ref='2 Samuel 7:12–15'>2Sa 7:12–15</a></i> ). Outline I.

His journey went first to Nob, where he deceived the priest Ahimelech into giving him bread and Goliath’s sword. He then sought refuge with the Philistine king Achish in Gath. The suspicions of the Philistines forced David to continue his flight, now to the cave of Adullam, where he was joined by his family. After taking his family to the safety of Moab, he established camp at an unspecified stronghold ( <a ref='1 Samuel 22:4'>1Sa 22:4</a> ). Saul’s pursuit, however, would not allow David to remain in one place. Other stops included Keilah, Engedi, and finally Ziklag, David’s camp until he moved to Hebron and became king of Judah.",

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='1 Samuel 1:1–7:17'>1:1—7:17</a> This first major division of the book begins and ends in Samuel’s home town of Ramah ( <a ref='1 Samuel 1:1'>1:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 7:17'>7:17</a> ). The focus of these chapters is on the life and ministry of Samuel. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:1–4:1'>First Samuel 1:1—4:1a</a> concentrates on Samuel as a prophet of Yahweh (see the concluding statement of <a ref='1 Samuel 4:1'>4:1a</a> , “the word of Samuel came to all Israel”). The text in <a ref='1 Samuel 4:1–7:17'>4:1b–7:17</a> emphasizes Samuel as judge (see <a ref='1 Samuel 7:17'>7:17</a> , “there he judged Israel”). <a ref='1 Samuel 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>a certain man.</b> This verse resembles the introduction to the birth of Samson in <a ref='Judges 13:2'>Jdg 13:2</a> . The strong comparison highlights similarities between Samson and Samuel: both men were judges over Israel, fighters of the Philistines, and lifelong Nazirites. <b>Ramathaim-zophim.</b> Possibly meaning “two heights,” the name occurs only here in the OT. Elsewhere, the town is simply called Ramah. It was located about 5 mi. north of Jerusalem. <b>Elkanah.</b> Meaning “God has created,” he was the father of Samuel. <b>Zuph.</b> “Zuph” is both a place ( <a ref='1 Samuel 9:5'>9:5</a> ) and a personal name ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:35'>1Chr 6:35</a> ), as here. <b>Ephraimite.</b> <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:27'>First Chronicles 6:27</a> identifies Elkanah as a member of the Kohathite branch of the tribe of Levi. The Levites lived among the other tribes ( <a ref='Joshua 21:20–22'>Jos 21:20–22</a> ). Ephraim was the tribal area where this Levite lived. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>two wives.</b> Although polygamy was not God’s intention for mankind ( <a ref='Genesis 2:24'>Ge 2:24</a> ), it was tolerated, but never endorsed in Israel (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 21:15–17'>Dt 21:15–17</a> ). Elkanah probably married Peninnah because Hannah was barren. <b>Hannah.</b> Meaning “grace,” she was probably Elkanah’s first wife. <b>Peninnah.</b> Meaning “ruby,” she was Elkanah’s second wife and the first bearer of his children. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>that man would go up … yearly.</b> All Israelite men were required to attend 3 annual feasts at the central sanctuary ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:1–17'>Dt 16:1–17</a> ). Elkanah regularly attended these festivals with his wives. The festival referred to here was probably the Feast of Tabernacles (Sept./Oct.) because of the feasting mentioned in <a ref='1 Samuel 1:9'>1:9</a> . <b>Yahweh of hosts.</b> This is the first OT occurrence of “hosts” being added to the divine name. “Hosts” can refer to human armies ( <a ref='Exodus 7:4'>Ex 7:4</a> ), celestial bodies ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:19'>Dt 4:19</a> ), or heavenly creatures ( <a ref='Joshua 5:14'>Jos 5:14</a> ). This title emphasizes Yahweh as sovereign over all of the powers in heaven and on earth, especially over the armies of Israel. <b>Shiloh.</b> Located about 20 mi. north of Jerusalem in Ephraim, the tabernacle and ark of the covenant resided here ( <a ref='Joshua 18:1'>Jos 18:1</a> ; <a ref='Judges 18:31'>Jdg 18:31</a> ). <b>Eli.</b> Meaning “exalted is Yahweh.” He was the High Priest at Shiloh. <b>Hophni and Phinehas.</b> Each of Eli’s two priestly sons had an Egyptian name: Hophni (“tadpole”) and Phinehas (“nubian”). <a ref='1 Samuel 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>sacrificed.</b> A peace offering since the worshipers ate a portion of the offering (see <a ref='Leviticus 7:11–18'>Lv 7:11–18</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>Yahweh had closed her womb.</b> Hannah’s barrenness was the result of divine providence like Sarah’s ( <a ref='Genesis 16:2'>Ge 16:2</a> ) and Rachel’s ( <a ref='Genesis 30:2'>Ge 30:2</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 1:6'>1:6</a> <b>Her rival.</b> The other wife was an adversary. <b>would provoke her.</b> Lit. “to thunder against” her; see <a ref='1 Samuel 2:10'>2:10</a> for the same word. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:7'>1:7</a> <b>would not eat.</b> Hannah fasted because of the provocation of Peninnah. She did not eat of the peace offerings. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>your heart sad.</b> The idiom used reflects anger, not sadness (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 15:10'>Dt 15:10</a> for the same idiom). <a ref='1 Samuel 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>temple.</b> Actually, the tabernacle. The mention of sleeping quarters ( <a ref='1 Samuel 3:2–3'>3:2–3</a> ) and doors ( <a ref='1 Samuel 3:15'>3:15</a> ) implies that at this time the tabernacle was part of a larger, more permanent building complex. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>vow.</b> Hannah pledged to give Yahweh her son in return for God’s favor in giving her that son. A married woman’s vow could be confirmed or nullified by her husband according to <a ref='Numbers 30:6–15'>Nu 30:6–15</a> . <b>Your maidservant.</b> A humble, submissive way of referring to herself in the presence of her superior, sovereign God. <b>remember me.</b> Hannah requested special attention and care from Yahweh. <b>all the days of his life.</b> A contrast to the normal Nazirite vow, which was only for a specified period of time (see <a ref='Numbers 6:4–5'>Nu 6:4–5</a> , <a ref='Numbers 6:8'>8</a> ). <b>a razor.</b> Though not specified as such in this chapter, the Nazirite vow is certainly presupposed. The nonshaving of the hair on one’s head is one of the 3 requirements of the vow ( <a ref='Numbers 6:5'>Nu 6:5</a> ). This expression was used elsewhere only of the Nazirite Samson ( <a ref='Judges 13:5'>Jdg 13:5</a> ; <a ref='Judges 16:17'>16:17</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>drunk.</b> Public prayer in Israel was usually audible. However, Hannah was praying silently, leaving Eli to surmise that she was drunk. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:16'>1:16</a> <b>vile woman.</b> Lit. “daughter of Belial.” Cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:12'>2:12</a> . <a ref='1 Samuel 1:20'>1:20</a> <b>Samuel.</b> The name lit. meant “name of God,” but sounded like “heard by God.” For Hannah the assonance was most important, because God had heard her prayer. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:21'>1:21</a> <b>his vow.</b> Elkanah supported and joined with his wife in her vow to Yahweh. With the birth of Samuel he brought his votive offering to Yahweh ( <a ref='Leviticus 7:16'>Lv 7:16</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 1:22'>1:22</a> <b>weaned.</b> As was customary in the ancient world, Samuel was probably breast fed for two to three years. Then he was left to serve Yahweh at the tabernacle for the rest of his life. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:23'>1:23</a> <b>His word.</b> Probably an earlier word of Yahweh not recorded in the text. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:24'>1:24</a> <b>bull … flour … wine.</b> According to <a ref='Numbers 15:8–10'>Nu 15:8–10</a> , a bull, flour, and wine were to be sacrificed in fulfillment of a vow. Hannah brought all 3 in larger measure than required. An ephah was about .75 bu. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:26'>1:26</a> <b>As your soul lives.</b> Lit. “by the light of your soul,” a common oath formula. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:27–28'>1:27–28</a> <b>asked … dedicated.</b> These terms are from the same Hebrew root used 4 times in these two verses. Twice in v. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:27'>27</a> it has the usual meaning of “asked.” Twice in v. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:28'>28</a> it bears the derived meaning “lent on request.” The son Hannah requested God had given, and she gives her gift back to the Giver. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:1–10'>2:1–10</a> In contrast to the prayer that came from her bitterness ( <a ref='1 Samuel 1:10'>1:10</a> ), Hannah prayed from joy in these verses. The prominent idea in Hannah’s prayer is that Yahweh is a righteous judge. He had brought down the proud (Peninnah) and exalted the humble (Hannah). The prayer has four sections: 1) Hannah prays to Yahweh for His salvation (vv. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:1–2'>1–2</a> ); 2) Hannah warned the proud of Yahweh’s humbling (vv. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:3–8'>3–8d</a> ); 3) Hannah affirmed Yahweh’s faithful care for His saints (vv. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:8–9'>8e–9b</a> ); 4) Hannah petitioned Yahweh to judge the world and to prosper His anointed king (vv. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:9–10'>9c–10e</a> ). This prayer has a number of striking verbal similarities with David’s song of <a ref='2 Samuel 22:2–51'>2Sa 22:2–51</a> : “horn” ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:1'>2:1</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 22:3'>22:3</a> ), “rock” ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:2'>2:2</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 22:2–3'>22:2–3</a> ), salvation/deliverance ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:1–2'>2:1–2</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 22:2–3'>22:2–3</a> ), grave/Sheol ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:6'>2:6</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 22:6'>22:6</a> ), “thunder” ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:10'>2:10</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 22:14'>22:14</a> ), “king” ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:10'>2:10</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 22:51'>22:51</a> ), and “anointed” ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:10'>2:10</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 22:51'>22:51</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>horn.</b> A symbol of strength, power (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:17'>Dt 33:17</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>rock.</b> A metaphor for God that emphasized His strength and the security of those who trust in Him (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:4'>Dt 32:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 18:1–2'>Ps 18:1–2</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 2:3'>2:3</a> <b>proudly … arrogance.</b> The majestic and powerful God humbles all those who vaunt themselves against Him. The idea of God’s humbling of the very proud is shown throughout 1-2 Samuel, toward Peninnah, Eli’s sons, the Philistines, Goliath, Saul, Nabal, Absalom, Shimei, Sheba, and even David. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:4–7'>2:4–7</a> Seven contrasts are found in these 4 verses: 1) mighty and weak; 2) full and hungry; 3) barren and fertile; 4) dead and alive; 5) sick and well; 6) poor and rich; and 7) humbled and exalted. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:5'>2:5</a> <b>gives birth to seven.</b> This is not a personal testimony since Hannah bore only 6 children ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:21'>2:21</a> ). “Seven” here is a general reference to women whom God blesses. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:8'>2:8</a> <b>pillars of the earth.</b> A figure of speech which pictures the earth’s stability (cf. <a ref='Psalms 75:3'>Pss 75:3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 82:5'>82:5</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 104:5'>104:5</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 2:10'>2:10</a> <b>Yahweh will render justice to the ends of the earth.</b> Yahweh will impose His righteous rule upon all the nations and peoples (see <a ref='Isaiah 2:2–4'>Is 2:2–4</a> ). <b>His king.</b> Moses had already predicted the coming of a king who would exercise God’s rule over all the nations of the earth ( <a ref='Genesis 49:8–12'>Ge 49:8–12</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 24:7–9'>Nu 24:7–9</a> , <a ref='Numbers 24:17–19'>17–19</a> ). It was this future, victorious king whom Hannah anticipated and Saul and David prefigured. <b>His anointed.</b> Previously in the OT, both the tabernacle and its utensils along with the priests (Aaron and his sons) had been anointed with oil. This pictured their consecrated and holy status before Yahweh ( <a ref='Exodus 30:26–30'>Ex 30:26–30</a> ). In Samuel, first Saul ( <a ref='1 Samuel 10:1'>10:1</a> ), and then David ( <a ref='1 Samuel 16:13'>16:13</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 2:4'>2Sa 2:4</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 5:3'>5:3</a> ) were anointed as they were inaugurated for the kingship. From this point in the OT, it is usually the king who is referred as “the anointed (of Yahweh)” ( <a ref='1 Samuel 12:3'>12:3</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 24:6'>24:6</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 26:9'>26:9</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 26:11'>11</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 26:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 1:14'>2Sa 1:14</a> , <a ref='2 Samuel 1:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 19:21'>19:21</a> ). The kings of Israel, particularly David, foreshadowed Yahweh’s ultimate anointed king. The English word “Messiah” represents the Hebrew word used here meaning “anointed.” Thus, this ultimate King who would rule over the nations of the earth came to be referred to as “the Messiah,” as here and <a ref='1 Samuel 2:35'>2:35</a> ; cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 22:51'>2Sa 22:51</a> . <a ref='1 Samuel 2:11'>2:11</a> <b>ministered to Yahweh.</b> As a Levite, the boy Samuel performed services that assisted Eli, the High Priest. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:12'>2:12</a> <b>vile.</b> “Sons of Belial” was a Hebrew way of saying base or wicked men. See <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:15'>2Co 6:15</a> , where it is used as a name for Satan. Eli had falsely considered Hannah a wicked woman ( <a ref='1 Samuel 1:16'>1:16</a> ). Eli’s sons were, in fact, wicked men. <b>they did not know Yahweh.</b> Eli’s sons had no personal experience of, nor fellowship with, Yahweh. The boy Samuel came to “know Yahweh” when Yahweh revealed Himself to him (see <a ref='1 Samuel 3:7'>3:7</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 2:13'>2:13</a> this was <b>the</b> legal <b>judgment for the priests.</b> Not content with the specified portions of the sacrifices given to the priests ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:3'>Dt 18:3</a> ), Eli’s sons would take for themselves whatever meat a 3-pronged fork would collect from a boiling pot. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:15'>2:15</a> <b>before they offered up the fat in smoke.</b> The law mandated that the fat of the sacrificial animal was to be burned on the altar to Yahweh ( <a ref='Leviticus 7:31'>Lv 7:31</a> ). In contrast, Eli’s sons demanded raw meat, including the fat, from the worshipers. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:18'>2:18</a> <b>Now Samuel.</b> The faithful ministry of Samuel before Yahweh was in sharp contrast to the disobedience of Eli’s sons. <b>linen ephod.</b> A close fitting, sleeveless outer vest extending to the hips and worn by priests, especially when officiating before the altar ( <a ref='Exodus 28:6–14'>Ex 28:6–14</a> ).

This divine, judicial hardening, the result of defiant refusal to repent in the past, was the reason Hophni and Phinehas refused to heed Eli’s warnings. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:26'>2:26</a> <b>growing in stature and in favor.</b> In contrast to the apostate sons of Eli, Samuel was maturing both spiritually and socially (cf. <a ref='Luke 2:52'>Lk 2:52</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 2:27'>2:27</a> <b>man of God.</b> Usually used as a synonym for “prophet” (see <a ref='1 Samuel 9:9–10'>9:9–10</a> ). <b>house of your father … in Egypt.</b> Although Eli’s genealogy was not recorded in the OT, he was a descendant of Aaron. Yahweh had revealed Himself to Aaron in Egypt before the Exodus (see <a ref='Exodus 4:4–16'>Ex 4:4–16</a> ). Aaron had been divinely chosen to serve Yahweh as the first in a long line of priests ( <a ref='Exodus 28:1–4'>Ex 28:1–4</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 2:28'>2:28</a> <b>to be My priests.</b> The chief duties of the priests were: 1) to place the offerings upon the altar; 2) to burn the incense in the holy place; and 3) to wear the linen ephod (see v. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:18'>18</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 2:29'>2:29</a> <b>My offering.</b> In recognition of their service to God and His people, the priests were allocated specific parts of the offering which were brought to the sanctuary (see <a ref='Leviticus 2:3'>Lv 2:3</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 2:10'>10</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 7:31–36'>7:31–36</a> ). <b>honor.</b> By condoning the sin of Hophni and Phinehas, Eli had shown preference for his sons above Yahweh.

Because of flagrant disobedience, the house of Eli would forfeit their priesthood. Although the Aaronic priesthood was perpetual, priests could forfeit their position by their sin. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:31'>2:31</a> <b>there will not be an old man in your house.</b> The judgment of untimely death followed the descendants of Eli. Eli’s sons died in the flower of their manhood ( <a ref='1 Samuel 4:11'>4:11</a> ). Later, Saul massacred the priests at Nob ( <a ref='1 Samuel 22:16–19'>22:16–19</a> ). Ultimately, Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood ( <a ref='1 Kings 2:26–27'>1Ki 2:26–27</a> ) and the priestly line of Eleazar prevailed, as God promised (cf. <a ref='Numbers 25:10–13'>Nu 25:10–13</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 2:32'>2:32</a> <b>the distress of</b> My <b>habitation.</b> This probably referred to the desecration of the tabernacle, where Yahweh dwelt, at Shiloh by the Philistines (see <a ref='Jeremiah 7:12–14'>Jer 7:12–14</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 2:34'>2:34</a> <b>the sign to you.</b> The death of Eli’s two sons on the same day validated the prophecy (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 4:11'>4:11</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 4:17'>17</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 2:35'>2:35</a> <b>I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest.</b> Although some have identified this priest as Samuel and others Christ, it is better to view the prophecy as fulfilled in the accession of Zadok and his family to the priestly office in the time of Solomon (see <a ref='1 Kings 1:7–8'>1Ki 1:7–8</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 2:26–27'>2:26–27</a> , <a ref='1 Kings 2:35'>35</a> ).

Yahweh’s presence validated His choice of a man for His service. <b>let none of his words fall to the ground.</b> Everything Samuel said with divine authorization came true.

Observe that “the word of Yahweh” ( <a ref='1 Samuel 3:21'>3:21</a> ) has become equivalent to “the word of Samuel.” <b>Philistines.</b> From the period of the judges through the end of David’s reign, the Philistines (“Sea Peoples”) were an ever-present enemy of Israel. They were non-Semitic immigrants (see <a ref='Genesis 10:14'>Ge 10:14</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 1:12'>1Chr 1:12</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 47:4–5'>Jer 47:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Amos 9:7'>Am 9:7</a> ) who settled along the coastal regions of southern Canaan, organizing their power in five chief cities: Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, Gath, and Gaza ( <a ref='1 Samuel 6:17'>1Sa 6:17</a> ; <a ref='Judges 3:13'>Jdg 3:13</a> ). The introduction of the Philistines into the narrative provides a link between the judgeship of Samuel and the judgeship which Samson was not able to complete ( <a ref='Jdg 13-16'>Jdg 13–16</a> ). <b>Ebenezer.</b> The location of this site has not been specifically identified. Opposite Aphek in Israelite territory, it is possibly modern Izbet Sarteh on the road to Shiloh. When translated it means “stone of help,” and its mention here (and <a ref='1 Samuel 5:1'>5:1</a> ) and again in <a ref='1 Samuel 7:12'>7:12</a> of another location mark this section as a literary unit. <b>Aphek.</b> This site is located near the source of the Yarkon River, at the southern end of the coastal plain of Sharon, approximately 5 mi. east of the Mediterranean. This city marked the northeastern edge of Philistine territory. <a ref='1 Samuel 4:3'>4:3</a> <b>Why has Yahweh defeated us…?</b> The question of the elders reflected their knowledge that Yahweh both fought their battles ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:10'>2:10</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 17:47'>17:47</a> ) and allowed their defeat. To be defeated clearly meant that God was not “among” them ( <a ref='Numbers 14:42'>Nu 14:42</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:42'>Dt 1:42</a> ). Instead of inquiring of Yahweh for direction, they proceeded to take the matter into their own hands. <b>Let us take … the ark.</b> The ark symbolized the presence and power of Yahweh. Yet, Israel treated it like a good-luck charm, which would ensure them victory over the Philistines. Knowing that victory or defeat depended upon Yahweh’s presence, they confused the symbol of His presence with His actual presence. In this way, their understanding of God resembled that of the Philistines ( <a ref='1 Samuel 4:8'>4:8</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 4:4'>4:4</a> <b>sits</b> above <b>the cherubim.</b> A repeated phrase used to describe Yahweh (see <a ref='2 Samuel 6:2'>2Sa 6:2</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 19:15'>2Ki 19:15</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 13:6'>1Chr 13:6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 80:1'>Pss 80:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 99:1'>99:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 37:16'>Is 37:16</a> ).

The fact that they were mentioned together recalls the prophecy that they would die together ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:34'>2:34</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 4:6'>4:6</a> <b>Hebrews.</b> In <a ref='Genesis 14:13'>Ge 14:13</a> , the name “Hebrew” was applied to Abram. Consequently, the name came to refer to the physical descendants of Abraham. It was used to distinguish them as a class of people distinct from the foreigners around them. It means that Abram was a descendant of Eber in the line of Shem ( <a ref='Genesis 10:25'>Ge 10:25</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 11:14–16'>11:14–16</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 4:7'>4:7</a> <b>God has come into the camp.</b> The idol, to the Philistine, was thought to be the actual dwelling place of his deity. Hence, when Israel brought the ark into the camp, the Philistines concluded that God was present, an exclamation that reflected a knowledge of God’s power. <a ref='1 Samuel 4:8'>4:8</a> <b>the gods who struck the Egyptians.</b> Evidently, the news of God’s victory over the Egyptians was common knowledge to the Philistines. <a ref='1 Samuel 4:9'>4:9</a> <b>slaves … as they have been slaves to you.</b> Israel’s failure to uproot all the inhabitants of Canaan (see <a ref='Judges 1:28'>Jdg 1:28</a> ) caused them to fall under the judgment of God. As a consequence of this judgment, Israel was enslaved to Philistine oppression (see <a ref='Jdg 10'>Jdg 10</a> , <a ref='Jdg 13-16'>13–16</a> ). The Philistines feared that they would become servants of the Hebrews.

The view of having the ark of God being equivalent to having control of God, possessed both by Israel and then the Philistines, is to be contrasted with the power and providence of God in the remaining narrative. <b>Hophni and Phinehas, died.</b> In fulfillment of <a ref='1 Samuel 2:34'>2:34</a> and <a ref='1 Samuel 3:12'>3:12</a> , Eli’s sons died together. <a ref='1 Samuel 4:12'>4:12</a> <b>his robes torn and dust on his head.</b> The actions of the man of Benjamin were considered to be universal signs of both mourning for the dead and of national calamity (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 15:32'>2Sa 15:32</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 4:13'>4:13</a> <b>his heart was trembling for the ark of God.</b> Eli’s concern for the ark stands in stark contrast to his earlier actions of honoring his two sons over honoring Yahweh ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:29–30'>2:29–30</a> ; cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 4:17–18'>4:17–18</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 4:18'>4:18</a> <b>Eli … died.</b> As was the case with Hophni and Phinehas, Eli died. Thus, in fulfillment of the word of Yahweh, all of the priestly line through Eli had been wiped out ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:29–34'>2:29–34</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='1 Samuel 2:31'>2:31</a> .</i> <b>he judged Israel forty years.</b> Over that time Eli fulfilled the office of both priest and judge in Israel. <a ref='1 Samuel 4:21'>4:21</a> <b>Ichabod … The glory has departed.</b> Due primarily to the loss of the ark, the symbol of God’s presence, Phinehas’ wife names her child Ichabod, meaning either “Where is the glory?” or “no glory.” To the Hebrew, “glory” was often used to refer to God’s presence; hence, the text means “Where is God?” The word “departed” carries the idea of having gone into exile. Thus, to the people of Israel, the capturing of the ark was a symbol that God had gone into exile. Although this was the mindset of Israel, the text narrative will reveal that God was present, even when He disciplined His people. <i>See note on <a ref='Ezekiel 10:18–19'>Eze 10:18–19</a> .</i> <a ref='1 Samuel 5:1'>5:1</a> <b>Ashdod.</b> One of the 5 chief Philistine cities, inland from the coast (3 mi.) and approximately 33 mi. west of Jerusalem. <a ref='1 Samuel 5:2'>5:2</a> <b>Dagon.</b> Ancient literature identifies this deity as a fish god, whose image had the lower body of a fish and the upper body of a man. Dagon seems to have been the leader of the Philistine pantheon ( <a ref='Judges 16:23'>Jdg 16:23</a> ) and is noted to be the father of Baal. The placing of the ark of God in the temple of Dagon was supposed to be a sign of Dagon’s power and Yahweh’s inferiority, a visual representation that the god of the Philistines was victorious over the God of the Hebrews. In addition, the textual connection of Dagon reinforces the affinity between the events written here and those in the life of Samson (cf. <a ref='Jdg 13-16'>Jdg 13–16</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 5:3'>5:3</a> <b>fallen on his face.</b> Ironically, God Himself overturned the supposed supremacy of Dagon by having Dagon fallen over, as if paying homage to Yahweh. <a ref='1 Samuel 5:4'>5:4</a> <b>head … hands</b> were <b>cut off.</b> The first display of God’s authority over Dagon was not perceived. God’s second display of authority, the cutting off of Dagon’s head and hands, was a common sign that the enemy was dead ( <a ref='Judges 7:25'>Jdg 7:25</a> ; <a ref='Judges 8:6'>8:6</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 17:54'>1Sa 17:54</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 31:9'>31:9</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 4:12'>2Sa 4:12</a> ), and was to be understood as God’s divine judgment on the false idol. <a ref='1 Samuel 5:5'>5:5</a> <b>tread on the threshold.</b> Because the head and hands of Dagon fell on the threshold, superstition developed that it was cursed; therefore, the Philistines would not tread on it. <b>to this day.</b> This phrase supports the claim that the writer was living at a time removed from the actual event itself (see Introduction: Author and Date ). This phrase and phrases equivalent to it are found throughout 1-2 Samuel ( <a ref='1 Samuel 6:18'>6:18</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 26:6'>26:6</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 30:25'>30:25</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 4:3'>2Sa 4:3</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 6:8'>6:8</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 18:18'>18:18</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 5:6'>5:6</a> <b>the hand of Yahweh was glorious.</b> In contrast to the hands of Dagon being cut off, symbolizing his helplessness against the power of Yahweh, Yahweh was pictured to be actively involved in judging the Philistines. The imagery of God’s hand is found throughout the ark narrative ( <a ref='1 Samuel 4:8'>4:8</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 5:6–7'>5:6–7</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 5:9'>9</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 5:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 6:3'>6:3</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 6:5'>5</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 6:9'>9</a> ). <b>tumors.</b> It has been suggested that this word refers to the sores or boils caused by an epidemic of the bubonic plague carried by rats ( <a ref='1 Samuel 6:4–5'>6:4–5</a> ). The spread of the disease and its deadly effect ( <a ref='1 Samuel 5:6'>5:6</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 5:9'>9</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 5:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 6:11'>6:11</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 6:17'>17</a> ) make this a likely view. <a ref='1 Samuel 5:8'>5:8</a> <b>lords of the Philistines.</b> Refers to those men who ruled the chief Philistine cities as kings ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 Samuel 4:1'>4:1</a></i> ). <b>Gath.</b> Another main Philistine city, located about 12 mi. east of Ashdod (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 5:1'>5:1</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 5:10'>5:10</a> <b>Ekron.</b> With judgment on Gath, the Philistines sent the ark away to the next main city to see if God was behind their calamity. Located about 6 mi. north of Gath, it was the closest major Philistine city to Israel’s border. <b>the ark … to put us.</b> The cry of the Ekronites was an admission that the Philistines had gotten the message that God was the source of their troubles. It is curious that the Philistines knew of God’s power to smite the Egyptians ( <a ref='1 Samuel 4:8'>4:8</a> ), yet they proudly believed themselves stronger than Egypt. The severity of the plagues grew increasingly worse in vv. <a ref='1 Samuel 5:6–12'>6–12</a> , corresponding with the failure of the Philistines to humble themselves before God. Their actions were very similar to those of the Egyptians ( <a ref='Ex 5-14'>Ex 5–14</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 6:2'>6:2</a> <b>the priests and the diviners.</b> These men of the Philistines, specifically identified in Scripture as having notable fame ( <a ref='Isaiah 2:6'>Is 2:6</a> ), were summoned to figure out how to appease God so that He would stop the plague. <b>send it to its place.</b> The Philistines understood that they had offended God. Their diviners decided to rightfully appease His wrath by sending the ark back to Israel. <a ref='1 Samuel 6:3'>6:3</a> <b>guilt offering.</b> The purpose behind this offering was to both acknowledge and compensate for their trespass of dishonoring the God of Israel. These pagans recognized their sin and the need for manifest repentance, which they did according to their religious tradition by means of votive trespass or guilt offerings. <a ref='1 Samuel 6:4'>6:4</a> <b>Five golden tumors and five golden mice.</b> It was their custom to make models of their sores (and the mice which brought the plague), in hopes that the deity would recognize that they knew why he was angry and remove the evil which had fallen upon them. The context of v. <a ref='1 Samuel 6:17'>17</a> suggests that the items were in the writer’s presence at the time the account was recorded. The number 5 represents each of the Philistine cities and lords affected by God’s judgment. <a ref='1 Samuel 6:5'>6:5</a> <b>give glory to the God of Israel … He will ease His hand.</b> While sympathetic magic was the Philistine custom, this statement expressly affirms the intention behind the offerings: They were to halt the dishonor, confess their sin, and give glory to the God of Israel by acknowledging who it was that they had offended and who was the supreme Deity. <a ref='1 Samuel 6:6'>6:6</a> <b>Why then do you harden your hearts…?</b> The diviners correlate the Philistines’ actions of not recognizing God with those of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. This is the same word “harden” that was used in <a ref='Exodus 7:14'>Ex 7:14</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 8:15'>8:15</a> , <a ref='Exodus 8:32'>32</a> . It is an interesting correlation, because the dominant purpose in <a ref='Ex 5-14'>Ex 5–14</a> is that the Egyptians might “know that I am Yahweh” ( <a ref='Exodus 7:5'>Ex 7:5</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 6:7'>6:7</a> <b>on which … never been a yoke.</b> To know without a doubt that the God of Israel was behind all of their troubles, the diviners devised a plan that would reveal whether God was the One responsible. Using cows which had “never been yoked” meant using animals that were untrained to pull a cart and probably would not go anywhere. <b>take their calves … away from them.</b> The second element in their plan was to use nursing cows taken away from their calves. For the cows unnaturally to head off in the opposite direction from their calves would be a clear sign that the cause of their judgment was supernatural. <a ref='1 Samuel 6:9'>6:9</a> <b>Beth-shemesh.</b> Named “house of the sun” and located in the Sorek Valley, this was a Levitical city about 15 mi. west of Jerusalem. Originally designated for the descendants of Aaron ( <a ref='Joshua 21:16'>Jos 21:16</a> ), it was chosen to be the destination of the cows pulling the cart. <a ref='1 Samuel 6:12'>6:12</a> <b>lowing as they went.</b> With the moaning from instinctive unwillingness to leave their calves behind, the cows went straight to Beth-shemesh, not turning to the right or left, leaving the inescapable conclusion that God had judged them. <a ref='1 Samuel 6:13'>6:13</a> <b>reaping their wheat harvest.</b> Sometime in June. These harvests were accomplished with the whole city participating. <a ref='1 Samuel 6:14'>6:14</a> <b>Joshua the Beth-shemite.</b> The cows stopped in the field of Joshua, where there was a large stone which was verifiable to the writer at the time the account was written. <b>burnt offering.</b> Because the cows and cart were used for sacred purposes, they could not be used for normal everyday purposes. Therefore, the men of Beth-shemesh sacrificed the cows using the cart for the fire. <a ref='1 Samuel 6:15'>6:15</a> <b>Levites.</b> The men of Beth-shemesh, being Levites, were qualified to move the ark. <b>put them on the large stone.</b> The stone mentioned was used as a pedestal for both the items of gold and the ark. At the time the account was written, it stood as a witness that God had returned to the land. <a ref='1 Samuel 6:16'>6:16</a> <b>five lords of the Philistines.</b> The lords of the Philistines, upon seeing that the ark arrived safely, returned to Ekron. <a ref='1 Samuel 6:19'>6:19</a> <b>looked into the ark.</b> This action on the part of the men of Beth-shemesh constituted the sin of presumption. This is first addressed in <a ref='Numbers 4:20'>Nu 4:20</a> and is mentioned again in <a ref='2 Samuel 6:6–7'>2Sa 6:6–7</a> . <b>50,070 men.</b> Some debate whether this figure is too large. However, retaining the larger number is more consistent with the context of “a great slaughter,” and the reference to 30,000 in <a ref='1 Samuel 4:10'>4:10</a> (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 11:8'>11:8</a> ). However, a scribal error could have occurred, in which case the number would omit the 50,000 and likely be “70,” as in Josephus. <a ref='1 Samuel 6:20'>6:20</a> <b>Who is able to stand before … God?</b> This question climaxes the narrative of the ark. No one is able to stand against God’s judgment. This applied to the people outside the covenant as well as those under the covenant. Presumption before God is unacceptable. <b>to whom shall He go.</b> The expression was used to denote the desire to take the ark away from them. <a ref='1 Samuel 6:21'>6:21</a> <b>Kiriath-jearim.</b> A city located approximately 10 mi. northeast of Beth-shemesh. It would remain the resting place of the ark until David brought it to Jerusalem ( <a ref='2 Samuel 6:1–19'>2Sa 6:1–19</a> ). This location had long been associated with Baal worship (cf. <a ref='Joshua 15:9'>Jos 15:9</a> , <a ref='Joshua 15:60'>60</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 18:14'>18:14</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 7:2'>7:2</a> <b>twenty years.</b> Coupled with v. <a ref='1 Samuel 7:3'>3</a> , the 20 years designated the period Israel neglected God and chased after foreign gods. After those 20 years, Israel returned to Yahweh. Capture and Return of the Ark Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='1 Samuel 7:3'>7:3</a> <b>set your hearts toward Yahweh … and He will deliver you.</b> This statement recalls the cycle in the book of Judges: apostasy, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. It previews the contents of this chapter. <a ref='1 Samuel 7:4'>7:4</a> <b>the Baals and the Ashtaroth.</b> Most dominant of the Canaanite pantheon, these deities were the fertility gods which plagued Israel. “Baal” and “Ashtaroth” are plurals of majesty, which signify their supreme authority over other Canaanite deities. Ashtaroth represented the female goddess, while Baal represented the male sky god who fertilized the land. <a ref='1 Samuel 7:5'>7:5</a> <b>Mizpah.</b> This city was located 8 mi. northeast of Kiriath-jearim in Benjamin. It became one of the cities of Samuel’s circuit (v. <a ref='1 Samuel 7:16'>16</a> ). <b>I will pray.</b> Samuel was a man of prayer ( <a ref='1 Samuel 7:8–9'>7:8–9</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 8:6'>8:6</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 12:19'>12:19</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 12:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 15:11'>15:11</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 7:6'>7:6</a> <b>drew water and poured it out before Yahweh.</b> The pouring out of water before Yahweh was a sign of repentance. This act is repeated in <a ref='2 Samuel 23:16'>2Sa 23:16</a> . <b>We have sinned against Yahweh.</b> The symbol of Samuel pouring out the water and the acknowledgment of the people reveal a situation where true repentance had taken place. The condition of the heart superseded the importance or righteousness of the ritual. <b>Samuel judged.</b> At this point Samuel is introduced as the judge of Israel. His judgeship encompassed both domestic leadership and the conduct of war. The word links the text back to the last comment about Eli who judged 40 years ( <a ref='1 Samuel 4:18'>4:18</a> ). Samuel is shown to be the one taking over Eli’s judgeship. He served as the last judge before the first king (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 8:5'>1Sa 8:5</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 7:7'>7:7</a> <b>Israel … afraid of the Philistines.</b> When Israel heard that the Philistines had come up against them for war, they were afraid. <a ref='1 Samuel 7:10'>7:10</a> <b>Yahweh thundered … against the Philistines.</b> In a literal manner, Yahweh did to His enemies what was said by Hannah in her prayer ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:10'>2:10</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 7:11'>7:11</a> <b>Beth-car.</b> The location is unknown. <a ref='1 Samuel 7:12'>7:12</a> <b>Ebenezer.</b> A different location from the one mentioned in <a ref='1 Samuel 4:1'>4:1</a> and <a ref='1 Samuel 5:1'>5:1</a> . The name functions as the literary knot for the two ends of this unit ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 Samuel 4:1'>4:1</a></i> ). <b>Thus far Yahweh has helped us.</b> This expression means that Yahweh was the One responsible for getting Israel to this point. He was Israel’s Sovereign One in times of both faithfulness and rebellion. He fought the battles and provided the blessings. <a ref='1 Samuel 7:13'>7:13</a> <b>did not come anymore within the border of Israel.</b> Yahweh gave Israel the victory over the Philistines, discontinuing their threat for the immediate future during Samuel’s judgeship. <b>all the days of Samuel.</b> As the section opened in <a ref='1 Samuel 4:1'>4:1</a> with Samuel pictured as God’s agent, so here the section closed with Yahweh working powerfully through all the days of Samuel. <a ref='1 Samuel 7:14'>7:14</a> <b>Ekron … to Gath.</b> These two cities, mentioned earlier as chief Philistine cities ( <a ref='1 Samuel 5:8'>5:8</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 5:10'>10</a> ), became the eastern border of the Philistines. The territory to the east of these cities was freed from Philistine control and returned to Israel. <b>Amorites.</b> Whereas the Philistines resided in the coastal plains, the Amorites resided in the hills west of Israel between the Jordan Valley and the coastal plain. As with the Philistines, Israel was at peace with the Amorites. <a ref='1 Samuel 7:16'>7:16</a> <b>on circuit.</b> The circuit was an annual trip made by Samuel; he would travel to Bethel, Gilgal, Mizpah, and return once again to Ramah, which allowed him to manage the affairs of the people. <a ref='1 Samuel 7:17'>7:17</a> <b>Ramah.</b> The first major division of the book ( <a ref='1 Samuel 1:1–7:17'>1:1—7:17</a> ) ends with Samuel returning to Ramah to judge the people. <a ref='1 Samuel 8:1–15:35'>8:1—15:35</a> This division of the book concentrates on the interaction between Israel, Samuel, and Saul. These chapters begin with the elders of Israel coming to Samuel at Ramah ( <a ref='1 Samuel 8:4'>8:4</a> ) and conclude with Samuel’s leaving Saul and returning to Ramah ( <a ref='1 Samuel 15:34'>15:34</a> ). Chapters <a ref='1 Samuel 8:1–12:25'>8:1—12:25</a> describe the establishment of the kingship over the nation of Israel and the advent of Saul as the first king. These chapters are linked by reference to Samuel’s being old ( <a ref='1 Samuel 8:1'>8:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 12:2'>12:2</a> ) and listening to “the voice of the people” ( <a ref='1 Samuel 8:7'>8:7</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 8:9'>9</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 8:19'>19</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 8:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 12:1'>12:1</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 12:14–15'>14–15</a> ). Chapters <a ref='1 Samuel 13:1–15:35'>13:1—15:35</a> recount the failures of Saul as king over Israel. The events of these chapters are bracketed by two interactions between Saul and Samuel that both take place in Gilgal ( <a ref='1 Samuel 13:4'>13:4</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 13:7–8'>7–8</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 13:12'>12</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 13:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 15:12'>15:12</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 15:21'>21</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 15:33'>33</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 8:1'>8:1</a> <b>Samuel was old.</b> Samuel was about 60 years of age (1043 BC). He appointed his two sons to serve as judges in Beersheba, a city about 57 mi. south of Ramah. <a ref='1 Samuel 8:2'>8:2</a> <b>Joel.</b> The name means “Yahweh is God.” <b>Abijah.</b> The name means “my Father is Yahweh.” <a ref='1 Samuel 8:3'>8:3</a> <b>his sons did not walk in his ways.</b> The perverted desire for riches led Samuel’s sons to take bribes and thereby pervert justice. These actions were strictly forbidden for judges in <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:19'>Dt 16:19</a> . The sins of Samuel’s sons became the pretext for Israel’s demand for a king (vv. <a ref='1 Samuel 8:4–5'>4–5</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 8:5'>8:5</a> <b>Now appoint a king for us … like all the nations.</b> When Israel entered the land, they encountered Canaanite city-states that were led by kings (see <a ref='Joshua 12:7–24'>Jos 12:7–24</a> ). Additionally, during the period of the judges, Israel was enslaved by nations that were led by kings ( <a ref='Judges 3:8'>Jdg 3:8</a> , <a ref='Judges 3:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Judges 4:2'>4:2</a> ; <a ref='Judges 8:5'>8:5</a> ; <a ref='Judges 11:12'>11:12</a> ). However, at the time of the judges there was no king in Israel ( <a ref='Judges 17:6'>Jdg 17:6</a> ; <a ref='Judges 18:1'>18:1</a> ; <a ref='Judges 19:1'>19:1</a> ; <a ref='Judges 21:25'>21:25</a> ). As Israel lived in the land surrounded by nations that had kings, the desire arose for a king in Israel also. According to <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:14'>Dt 17:14</a> , God knew this would be their desire, and He would allow it to occur. However, v. <a ref='1 Samuel 8:20'>20</a> revealed a motive which was definitely counter to Yahweh’s will. <i>See note on <a ref='1 Samuel 8:20'>8:20</a> .</i> Messianic Prophecies in the Psalms Prophecy Psalm Fulfillment 1.

Israel no longer wanted Yahweh to be their warrior; replacing Him with a human king was their desire. It was in this way that Israel rejected Yahweh (see v. <a ref='1 Samuel 8:7'>7</a> ).

Carmel of Elijah fame ( <a ref='1 Kings 18:20'>1Ki 18:20ff.</a> ), but a Carmel located 7 mi. south of Hebron. <b>monument for himself.</b> Saul, apparently taking credit for the victory, established a monument to himself (cf. Absalom in <a ref='2 Samuel 18:18'>2Sa 18:18</a> ). This foolish act of contemptible pride was Saul’s expression of self-worship rather than true worship of God and another evidence of his spiritual weakness. <b>Gilgal.</b> The site of Samuel’s first confrontation with Saul ( <a ref='1 Samuel 13:7–15'>13:7b–15</a> ) became the site of this pronouncement of judgment. <a ref='1 Samuel 15:13'>15:13</a> <b>I have established the word of Yahweh.</b> Saul, either ignorantly or deceitfully, maintained that he did what was commanded ( <a ref='1 Samuel 15:20'>15:20</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 15:15'>15:15</a> <b>the people spared the best … to sacrifice.</b> Saul began to place blame on others, making room for his own excuses just as he had done earlier (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 13:11–12'>13:11–12</a> ). Then he tried to justify his sin by saying that the animals would be used to sacrifice to the God of Samuel. Saul’s blatant disobedience at least pained his conscience so that he could not claim God as his God. Before David Became King Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='1 Samuel 15:17'>15:17</a> <b>little in your own eyes.</b> Saul’s status before he became king was as a humble and lowly Benjamite (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 9:21'>9:21</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 15:19'>15:19</a> <b>rushed upon the spoil.</b> Saul and the people greedily took the spoil like a bird of prey diving on its victim. <a ref='1 Samuel 15:20–21'>15:20–21</a> <b>I did obey the voice of Yahweh.</b> Instead of confessing his sin and repenting, Saul continued to justify himself. <a ref='1 Samuel 15:22'>15:22</a> <b>to obey is better than sacrifice.</b> This is an essential OT truth. Samuel stated that God desires heart obedience over the ritual sacrifice of animals (cf. <a ref='Psalms 51:16–17'>Ps 51:16–17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 1:10–17'>Is 1:10–17</a> ). The sacrificial system was never intended to function in place of living an obedient life, but was rather to be an expression of it (cf. <a ref='Hosea 6:6'>Hos 6:6</a> ; <a ref='Amos 5:21–27'>Am 5:21–27</a> ; <a ref='Micah 6:6–8'>Mic 6:6–8</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 15:23'>15:23</a> <b>rebellion … insubordination.</b> Saul needed to see that his real worship was indicated by his behavior and not by his sacrifices. He demonstrated himself to be an idolater whose idol was himself. He had failed the conditions ( <a ref='1 Samuel 12:13–15'>12:13–15</a> ) which would have brought blessing on the nation. His disobedience here was on the same level as witchcraft and idolatry, sins worthy of death. <b>Because you have rejected … He has also rejected.</b> A universal principle is given here that those who continually reject God will one day be rejected by Him. The sins of Saul caused God to immediately depose Saul and his descendants forever from the throne of Israel. <a ref='1 Samuel 15:24'>15:24</a> <b>I have sinned.</b> This overdue confession appears to be generated more by a concern over consequences (regret) than by sorrow over having offended holy God (repentance). He bypasses his personal responsibility by shifting blame to the people. <a ref='1 Samuel 15:25'>15:25</a> <b>return with me.</b> Saul was concerned about having Samuel’s visible presence as a show of support in front of the people (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 15:30'>15:30</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 15:28'>15:28</a> <b>torn the kingdom.</b> Saul’s judgment was a settled matter on the day of his disobedience with the Amalekites.

Sadly, the Israelites did not exterminate the wicked Amalekites, so they came back later to raid the southern territory and take women and children captive, including David’s family (see <a ref='1Sa 30'>1Sa 30</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 15:35'>15:35</a> <b>Samuel did not see Saul again … grieved.</b> Samuel never went to visit the rejected King Saul again in his life (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:11–19'>1Sa 28:11–19</a> ). On at least one further occasion, Saul sought Samuel (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 19:24'>19:24</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 16:1–31:13'>16:1—31:13</a> The third major division of Samuel recounts the steady demise of Saul and the selection and preparation of David for the kingship. Chapter <a ref='1Sa 16'>16</a> begins with Samuel mourning for Saul as one would mourn for the dead. The death of Saul ( <a ref='1 Samuel 31:1–13'>31:1–13</a> ) concludes this last division of the book. <a ref='1 Samuel 16:1'>16:1</a> <b>Jesse the Bethlehemite.</b> God’s new king of Israel (and ultimately the Messiah; <a ref='Genesis 3:15'>Ge 3:15</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 24:17'>Nu 24:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 2:10'>1Sa 2:10</a> ; <a ref='Ps 2'>Ps 2</a> ) would come from the tribe of Judah (Jesse; cf. <a ref='Ruth 4:12'>Ru 4:12</a> , <a ref='Ruth 4:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 49:10'>Ge 49:10</a> ) and from Bethlehem of Judah (cf. <a ref='Micah 5:2'>Mic 5:2</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 2:2–6'>Mt 2:2–6</a> ). <b>I see among his sons … Me.</b> The king was chosen and provided by God ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:15'>Dt 17:15</a> ), who orders all things according to the counsel of His own will ( <a ref='Isaiah 40:14'>Is 40:14</a> ), not according to human desires ( <a ref='1 Samuel 8:5–6'>8:5–6</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 2:8–9'>2Sa 2:8–9</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 16:2'>16:2</a> <b>Saul … will kill me.</b> Saul’s unbalanced emotional state was already known in Israel. It is ironic that Samuel’s initial reaction to the word of Yahweh was fear of Saul instead of rejoicing at God’s provision to Israel (and ultimately to all the nations; e.g., <a ref='1 Kings 8:41–43'>1Ki 8:41–43</a> ). The route from Ramah to Bethlehem would take Samuel through Gibeah of Saul (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 10:26'>10:26</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 11:14'>11:14</a> ). <b>I have come to sacrifice.</b> The place of sacrifice could be in any town until the establishment of the house of God in Jerusalem ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:11'>Dt 12:11</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 16:3'>16:3</a> <b>anoint.</b> David’s first anointing was performed by Samuel, symbolizing God’s recognition/ordination (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:10'>2:10</a> ). The following two anointings ( <a ref='2 Samuel 2:7'>2Sa 2:7</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 5:3'>5:3</a> ) were to establish David as king publicly for the benefit of Judah and Israel respectively. <a ref='1 Samuel 16:4'>16:4</a> <b>the elders of the city came trembling.</b> The elders, and no doubt all Israel, had heard of Samuel’s execution of Agag ( <a ref='1 Samuel 15:33'>15:33</a> ). Israel still closely associated the “seer,” or prophet, with the not-so-distant past office of “judge.” <a ref='1 Samuel 16:5'>16:5</a> <b>Set yourselves apart as holy.</b> Worship of Yahweh was always preceded by cleansing or washing, both of the outward garments and the inner man ( <a ref='Exodus 19:10'>Ex 19:10</a> , <a ref='Exodus 19:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='1 John 1:9'>1Jn 1:9</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 16:6'>16:6</a> <b>Eliab.</b> Lit. “My God is Father.” Since Eliab was the first of Jesse’s sons to catch Samuel’s eye, he must have been an impressive young man by outward appearance. <a ref='1 Samuel 16:7'>16:7</a> <b>his appearance … height of his stature.</b> Samuel needed to be reminded that God’s anointed was not chosen because of physical attributes. This was initially a difficult concept for Samuel as he was accustomed to a king whose only positive attributes were physical. <b>Yahweh looks at the heart.</b> The Hebrew concept of “heart” embodies emotions, will, intellect, and desires. The life of the man will reflect his heart (cf. <a ref='Matthew 12:34–35'>Mt 12:34–35</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 16:8'>16:8</a> <b>Abinadab.</b> Lit. “My Father is noble.” Samuel, now more sensitive to the leading of God’s Spirit, quickly discerned that Abinadab was not God’s anointed. <a ref='1 Samuel 16:9'>16:9</a> <b>Shammah.</b> Lit. “Yahweh hears (or heard).” See <a ref='1 Samuel 16:8'>16:8</a> . <a ref='1 Samuel 16:10'>16:10</a> <b>seven … sons.</b> With David, Jesse had 8 sons. The fact that <a ref='1 Chronicles 2:13'>1Chr 2:13</a> indicates 7 sons must mean that one of the 8 died afterward, and this is not considered in the Chronicles account. <a ref='1 Samuel 16:11'>16:11</a> <b>the youngest … shepherding the sheep.</b> God’s favor/choice often fell on the younger and the least (cf. Jacob, Joseph, Gideon). David, although the youngest, was the firstborn over Israel ( <a ref='Psalms 89:27'>Ps 89:27</a> ), whose humble beginnings as a shepherd, and later rule as king, typify Jesus: the ultimate Shepherd and King of Israel. <a ref='1 Samuel 16:12'>16:12</a> <b>ruddy … beautiful eyes … handsome.</b> God’s chosen king was handsome to look at, although that was not the reason for his selection by God. His appearance was perhaps enhanced by a genuine faith and joy in Yahweh. See also <a ref='1 Samuel 17:42'>17:42</a> . <a ref='1 Samuel 16:13'>16:13</a> <b>anointed him in the midst of his brothers.</b> David’s first anointing is before his family/house. His second anointing would be before the assembly of his tribe, Judah; and his third anointing would be before the nation Israel. ( <i>See note on <a ref='1 Samuel 16:3'>16:3</a> .</i> ) <b>the Spirit of Yahweh came … upon David.</b> This familiar OT expression relates to empowerment for some God-given task (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 10:6'>10:6</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 10:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 11:6'>11:6</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 19:20'>19:20</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 19:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 23:2'>2Sa 23:2</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:14'>2Chr 20:14</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:2'>Is 11:2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 61:1'>61:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 11:5'>Eze 11:5</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 37:1'>37:1</a> ). David’s anointing was an external symbol of an inward work of God. The operation of the Holy Spirit in this case was not for regeneration, but for empowerment to perform his (David’s) role in God’s program for Israel (cf. Saul, <a ref='1 Samuel 10:6'>10:6</a> ). After David sinned with Bathsheba ( <a ref='2Sa 11-12'>2Sa 11–12</a> ), he prayed, “Do not take Your Holy Spirit from me” ( <a ref='Psalms 51:11'>Ps 51:11</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 16:14'>16:14</a> <b>the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul.</b> When David’s ascent to the throne began, Saul’s slow and painful descent began also (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 18:12'>18:12</a> ). Without God’s empowering Holy Spirit, Saul was effectively no longer king over Israel ( <a ref='1 Samuel 15:28'>15:28</a> ), although his physical removal from the throne, and his death, happened many years later. <b>an evil spirit.</b> God, in His sovereignty, allowed an evil spirit to torment Saul (cf. <a ref='Judges 9:23'>Jdg 9:23</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 22:19–23'>1Ki 22:19–23</a> ; <a ref='Job 1:6–12'>Job 1:6–12</a> ) for His purpose of establishing the throne of David. This spirit, a messenger from Satan, is to be distinguished from a troubled emotional state brought on by indwelling sin, or the harmful consequences of the sinful acts of others (e.g., spirit of jealousy, <a ref='Numbers 5:14'>Nu 5:14</a> ). This demon spirit attacked Saul from without, for there is no evidence that the demon indwelt Saul. <b>terrorized him.</b> Saul, whose inward constitution was already prone to questionable judgment and the fear of men, began to experience God’s judgment in the form of severe bouts of depression, anger, and delusion, initiated and aggravated by the evil spirit assigned to him. There are several NT occasions where God turned people over to demons or Satan for judgment (see <a ref='Acts 5:1–3'>Ac 5:1–3</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 5:1–7'>1Co 5:1–7</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 1:18–20'>1Ti 1:18–20</a> ).

Later proven so skillful in the art of war and killing, David was also a tender musician of exceptional skill and reputation. <b>Yahweh is with him.</b> The saints of God, OT and NT, are recognized by their fruit ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:26'>2:26</a> ; <a ref='Luke 2:40'>Lk 2:40</a> ).

They wisely fled in terror, but did not honor the terms of Goliath if he lost ( <a ref='1 Samuel 17:6–9'>17:6–9</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 17:54'>17:54</a> <b>to Jerusalem.</b> The Jebusites, who were the inhabitants of Jerusalem, were a stubborn, resistant people (cf. <a ref='Joshua 15:63'>Jos 15:63</a> ; <a ref='Judges 1:21'>Jdg 1:21</a> ; <a ref='Judges 19:10–11'>19:10–11</a> ), particularly to the tribe of Judah. They doubtless began to feel some anxiety concerning the victory of this Bethlehemite. The head of Goliath was a constant warning to them over the ensuing days as to their future (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 5:6–10'>2Sa 5:6–10</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 17:55'>17:55</a> <b>Abner.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='1 Samuel 14:50'>14:50</a> .</i> <b>whose son.</b> David’s lineage was of the utmost importance to Saul at this point, since the victor over Goliath would marry into his family (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 17:25'>17:25</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 18:18'>18:18</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 18:1'>18:1</a> <b>Jonathan loved him.</b> Jonathan loved David with a loyalty and devotion indicative of covenantal love ( <a ref='1 Samuel 18:3'>18:3</a> ).

Saul was aware of his promise of wife and wealth ( <a ref='1 Samuel 17:25'>17:25</a> ), and, no doubt, the stirrings of anxiety/fear were in his heart toward David, who appeared as a threat.

Saul’s speeches in the midst of the house were the ravings of one troubled by an evil spirit like other false prophets (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 22:19–23'>1Ki 22:19–23</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 18:11'>18:11</a> <b>David escaped … twice.</b> As Saul’s behavior was becoming increasingly violent, he made more than one attempt on David’s life with the javelin.

Saul’s later retraction of the betrothal to Merab (v. <a ref='1 Samuel 18:19'>19</a> ) was similar to Laban’s trickery with Jacob and Rachel ( <a ref='Genesis 29:25'>Ge 29:25</a> ). <b>fight Yahweh’s battles.</b> A phrase Saul knew would appeal to David. Saul made the offer out of a treacherous heart, desiring evil and calamity for David. Notice the similarity between Saul’s treachery and that of David with Uriah ( <a ref='2 Samuel 11:15'>2Sa 11:15</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 18:18'>18:18</a> <b>son-in-law.</b> The familial lineage was crucial when marrying into the king’s family. David asked, “Who am I … <i>or</i> my father’s family in Israel, that I should be the king’s son-in-law?” Saul had asked of David’s lineage 3 times previously ( <a ref='1 Samuel 17:55–56'>17:55–56</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 17:58'>58</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 18:19'>18:19</a> <b>Adriel the Meholathite.</b> Merab married this man and bore children, 5 of whom were sons later executed by David as punishment for Saul’s disregard of Joshua’s covenant with the Gibeonites ( <a ref='2 Samuel 21:8'>2Sa 21:8</a> ; cf. <a ref='Joshua 9:20'>Jos 9:20</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 18:20'>18:20</a> <b>Michal.</b> Lit. “Who is like God?” Michal sincerely loved David and perhaps was aware, as Jonathan, of his certain ascent (and right) to the throne. Ironically, Saul offered her to David, not from a benevolent heart, but as a “snare” (v. <a ref='1 Samuel 18:21'>21</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 18:25'>18:25</a> <b>dowry.</b> Lit. “price.” Saul resorted to the same treachery in his offer of betrothal to Merab, plotting to eliminate David by placing him in jeopardy with the Philistines. David, already having proved himself wise in many things ( <a ref='1 Samuel 16:18'>16:18</a> ), was aware, to some extent, of Saul’s intent and acted obediently, valiantly, and wisely. <a ref='1 Samuel 18:25'>18:25</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 18:27'>27</a> <b>foreskins.</b> Such mutilations of the bodies of slain enemies were commonly practiced in ancient warfare.

Saul asked for 100 Philistine foreskins; David brought 200. Saul offered Michal as a “snare”; Michal loved David as did Saul’s own son, Jonathan. There remained nothing else for Saul to contrive except open hatred toward David. <a ref='1 Samuel 19:1'>19:1</a> <b>put David to death.</b> Saul no longer tried to disguise or cover his evil intent toward David, but ironically made known his intent to those who held David in the highest esteem (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 16:18'>16:18</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 18:1–4'>18:1–4</a> ). God, in His mercy, made sure that David had sympathetic ears within Saul’s court to inform him of Saul’s evil plans (e.g., <a ref='1 Samuel 19:7'>19:7</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 20:2'>20:2</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 19:4'>19:4</a> <b>Jonathan spoke well of David.</b> Jonathan attempted to persuade his father with calm reason. Jonathan’s reason was tempered by a godly attitude centered on a remembrance of the Torah ( <a ref='1 Samuel 14:6'>14:6</a> ; cf. <a ref='Numbers 11:23'>Nu 11:23</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 14:9'>14:9</a> ) and a covenantal loyalty toward and faithfulness for David. <a ref='1 Samuel 19:4–5'>19:4–5</a> <b>he has not sinned.</b> Jonathan reminded Saul that David had done nothing to deserve death; in fact, he was worthy of honor for his good works toward the king and Israel.

This anxious thinking and the fear that fell upon him explain David’s actions in this chapter. God had told him to stay in Judah ( <a ref='1 Samuel 22:5'>22:5</a> ), but he was afraid and sought protection again among the Philistine enemies of Israel (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 21:10–15'>21:10–15</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 27:3'>27:3</a> <b>two wives.</b> His third wife, Michal, had been temporarily given to another man by Saul (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 25:44'>25:44</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 27:4'>27:4</a> <b>no longer searched for him.</b> Saul was no longer able to pursue David since he was out of the land of Israel. <a ref='1 Samuel 27:5'>27:5</a> <b>the royal city.</b> I.e., Gath.

See Introduction: Author and Date . <a ref='1 Samuel 27:7'>27:7</a> <b>a year and four months.</b> For 16 months David was able to deceive Achish concerning his actions. He remained there until after Saul’s death when he moved to Hebron ( <a ref='2 Samuel 1:1'>2Sa 1:1</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 2:1–2'>2:1–2</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 27:8'>27:8</a> <b>Geshurites … Girzites … Amalekites.</b> These peoples lived in southern Canaan and northern Sinai. <b>Shur … Egypt.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='1 Samuel 15:7'>15:7</a> .</i> <a ref='1 Samuel 27:9'>27:9</a> <b>did not leave a man or a woman alive.</b> David left no survivors from his raids in order that Achish might not learn the true nature of his desert exploits (see v. <a ref='1 Samuel 27:11'>11</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 27:10'>27:10</a> <b>Judah … Jerahmeelites … Kenites.</b> The regions south of the hill country centering around Beersheba. This region was far enough away from Gath so that Achish would be ignorant of David’s movements. David implied to Achish that the hostility of Judah toward David was increasing, while in fact he was gaining the appreciation and loyalty of Judah toward himself by raiding their wilderness neighbors. Achish thought David was more securely his servant as his own people turned against him (vv. <a ref='1 Samuel 27:2–4'>2–4</a> ), but just the opposite was true. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:1'>28:1</a> <b>Know assuredly.</b> The kindness showed to David and his men by Achish in Gath was not without expectation of reciprocation. This phrase seems to presuppose an understanding of this expectation. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:2'>28:2</a> <b>what your servant can do.</b> Being a man of honor, David would not fail to help those who had shown him kindness. David was drawing attention to the fact that he had proven himself as a valiant and successful warrior and was assuring Achish of his fidelity and ability. <b>bodyguard.</b> In light of David’s victory over Goliath ( <a ref='1 Samuel 17:49–54'>17:49–54</a> ) and imagined bad reputation among the Israelites, Achish was expressing considerable trust in David’s loyalty and ability, for “bodyguard” lit. means “keeper of my head.” <a ref='1 Samuel 28:3–13'>28:3–13</a> Having deprived himself of every legitimate means of spiritual input as a result of his own disobedience and rebellion, Saul walked in foolishness again by seeking out the very resource (a medium) he had previously removed from the land. Saul swore to the medium an oath of safety by the very God that he was disobeying even then. Yet the inexorable curiosity of Saul to consult Samuel, in spite of Samuel’s death, was satisfied by the medium’s willingness to “bring up” Samuel. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:3'>28:3</a> <b>mediums and spiritists.</b> By divine law, they were banned from Israel ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:11'>Dt 18:11</a> ), and Israel was not to be defiled by them ( <a ref='Leviticus 19:31'>Lv 19:31</a> ). Turning to them was tantamount to playing the harlot and would result in God setting His face against the person and cutting him off from among His people ( <a ref='Leviticus 20:6'>Lv 20:6</a> ). Mediums and spiritists were to be put to death by stoning ( <a ref='Leviticus 20:27'>Lv 20:27</a> ). Even Saul understood this and had previously dealt with the issue (see v. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:9'>9</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 28:4'>28:4</a> <b>Shunem.</b> Situated southwest of the hill of Moreh and 16 mi. southwest of the Sea of Galilee; the Philistines designated it as their campsite. <b>Gilboa.</b> The mountain range beginning 5 mi. south of Shunem and extending southward along the eastern edge of the plain of Jezreel. <i>See note on <a ref='1 Samuel 31:1'>31:1</a> .</i> <a ref='1 Samuel 28:5'>28:5</a> <b>his heart trembled greatly.</b> Saul had hidden himself when he was chosen by lot to be king ( <a ref='1 Samuel 10:22'>10:22</a> ). When the Spirit of Yahweh came upon him, he was changed ( <a ref='1 Samuel 10:6'>10:6</a> ), but after the Spirit had departed ( <a ref='1 Samuel 16:14'>16:14</a> ), he was afraid and dismayed by Goliath ( <a ref='1 Samuel 17:11'>17:11</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 17:24'>24</a> ). He feared at Gilgal when faced by the overwhelming size of the Philistine army ( <a ref='1 Samuel 13:11–12'>13:11–12</a> ). Saul was also afraid of David because he knew that Yahweh was with David ( <a ref='1 Samuel 18:12'>18:12</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 18:29'>29</a> ). But Saul was to fear God ( <a ref='1 Samuel 12:24'>12:24</a> ), not people. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:6'>28:6</a> <b>dreams … Urim … prophets.</b> These were the 3 basic ways through which God revealed His Word and His will. Dreams and visions were the common manner through which Yahweh revealed Himself and His will during the time of Moses ( <a ref='Numbers 12:6'>Nu 12:6</a> ). The Urim was used by the priest as a means of inquiring of Yahweh ( <a ref='Numbers 27:21'>Nu 27:21</a> ). It was originally put in the breastpiece of judgment with the Thummim and worn over Aaron’s heart when he went in before Yahweh ( <i>see note on <a ref='Exodus 28:30'>Ex 28:30</a></i> ). Somehow, unknown to us, God revealed His will by it. Prophets were formerly called seers ( <a ref='1 Samuel 9:9'>9:9</a> ) and were used as a reference for inquiring of Yahweh. God also used prophets to declare His Word when people were not interested in it ( <a ref='Amos 7:12–13'>Am 7:12–13</a> ). Since Saul had rejected Yahweh, God had rejected him ( <a ref='1 Samuel 15:23'>15:23</a> ). Saul appears to have had no court prophet in the manner that Gad and Nathan were to David ( <a ref='1 Samuel 22:5'>22:5</a> ; <a ref='2Sa 12'>2Sa 12</a> ); and, by this time, the ephod with the Urim was in David’s possession by virtue of Abiathar the priest ( <a ref='1 Samuel 23:6'>23:6</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 28:7'>28:7</a> <b>Seek for me. … medium.</b> In Saul’s desperation, he sought the very source that he had formerly removed from the land ( <a ref='1 Samuel 28:3'>28:3</a> ). In spite of the ban, Saul’s servant knew exactly where to find a medium. <b>En-dor.</b> Located about 3.5 mi. northwest of Shunem between Mt. Tabor and the Hill of Moreh. Saul risked his life by venturing into the Philistine-held territory to seek out the counsel of the medium; thus he went in disguise by night (v. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:8'>8</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 28:10'>28:10</a> <b>swore to her by Yahweh.</b> Though blatantly walking in disobedience to God, it is ironic that Saul would swear by the very existence of Yahweh as a means of assuring his credibility to the medium. Even more, Saul swore that no punishment would come upon her when the Levitical law required her to be stoned to death ( <a ref='Leviticus 20:27'>Lv 20:27</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 28:12'>28:12</a> <b>the woman saw Samuel.</b> Though questions have arisen as to the nature of Samuel’s appearance, the text clearly indicates that Samuel, not an apparition, was evident to the eyes of the medium. God miraculously permitted the actual spirit of Samuel to speak (vv. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:16–19'>16–19</a> ). Because she understood her inability to raise the dead in this manner, she immediately knew 1) that it must have been by the power of God and 2) that her disguised inquirer must be Saul. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:13'>28:13</a> <b>divine being coming up out of the earth.</b> The word translated “divine being” is actually the Hebrew word meaning “God, gods, angel, ruler, or judge.” It can also be used to designate a likeness to one of these. From the medium’s perspective, Samuel appeared to be “like a divine being” ascending out of the earth. There is no other such miracle as this in all of Scripture. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:14'>28:14</a> <b>old man … with a robe.</b> Obviously age and clothing do not exist in the realm of the spirits of those who have died, but God miraculously gave such appearances so that Saul was able to perceive that the spirit was Samuel. The question arises whether all believers will remain in the form they were in when they died. Samuel may have been as such simply for the benefit of Saul, or he might be in this state until he receives his resurrection body. Since Scripture teaches that the resurrection of OT saints is yet future (see <a ref='Daniel 12:1–2'>Da 12:1–2</a> ), Samuel must have temporarily been in this condition solely for the benefit of Saul. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:15'>28:15</a> <b>disturbed me.</b> Samuel’s comment expresses agitation caused by Saul’s efforts to contact him since living humanity was not allowed to seek out discussions with the dead ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:11'>Dt 18:11</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 20:6'>Lv 20:6</a> ). Witchcraft puts the seeker in contact with demons impersonating those who are being sought, since the dead person cannot ordinarily be contacted, except in this unique case. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:16'>28:16</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 28:18'>18</a> <b>your adversary.</b> See <a ref='1 Samuel 15:26–35'>15:26–35</a> . <a ref='1 Samuel 28:19'>28:19</a> <b>will be with me.</b> This could mean with him in “the abode of the righteous.” There is no doubt that Samuel meant this to serve as a premonition of Saul’s soon death. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:20'>28:20</a> <b>no strength in him.</b> Already afraid with a heart that “trembled greatly” because of the Philistines (v. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:5'>5</a> ), Saul’s fear was so heightened by the words of Samuel that he was completely deprived of strength and vigor, which was reinforced by a lack of nourishment. The woman met his physical needs, and he returned to his camp to await his doom (vv. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:21–25'>21–25</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 29:1'>29:1</a> <b>gathered … camping.</b> The Philistines were assembling for battle while the Israelites were still camping by the spring. This picks up the story line originally started in <a ref='1 Samuel 28:1'>28:1</a> , but which was sidelined to communicate Saul’s encounter with the medium. <b>Aphek.</b> Located about 24 mi. north of Gath (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 4:1'>4:1</a> ). <b>Jezreel.</b> Only a few mi. south of Shunem, and 40 mi. northeast of Aphek, Jezreel was north of Mt. Gilboa. <a ref='1 Samuel 29:3'>29:3</a> <b>no fault.</b> David had proven himself as an honorable and righteous man before Achish, who knew that he could trust David. <a ref='1 Samuel 29:4'>29:4</a> <b>he may become an adversary.</b> The Philistine lords were not as willing as Achish to give favor and trust to David. Being very shrewd in their estimation of potential hazards, they realized that he might be feigning loyalty to the Philistines in order to seize a strategic moment in the battle when he could betray and fight against them. <a ref='1 Samuel 29:5'>29:5</a> <b>David, of whom they sing.</b> The fame of David had spread throughout the land. The Philistine lords were no stranger to the skill and the victories that God had given to mighty David. <a ref='1 Samuel 29:6'>29:6</a> As <b>Yahweh lives.</b> When seeking the highest standard by which to assure David of his credibility, Achish swore by the existence of David’s God. It is evident that the pagan world knows of God, but the irony is that their knowledge does not necessarily lead to repentance. <a ref='1 Samuel 29:8'>29:8</a> <b>the enemies of my lord the king.</b> David’s fidelity to Achish seemed to be at its climax in this expression of loyalty. David appears to have been fully prepared to do battle on behalf of Achish against his enemies, namely Israel. In light of David’s former refusal to stretch out his hand against Yahweh’s anointed ( <a ref='1 Samuel 24:6'>24:6</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 24:10'>10</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 26:9'>26:9</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 26:11'>11</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 26:21'>21</a> ), David might have been capitulating and compromising. He did not inquire of Yahweh before going to live with Achish, nor did he inquire of Yahweh as to whether he should go out to battle with Achish. On the other hand, it could be that while David gave the appearance of loyalty, he actually believed the Philistines would not let him go out to battle, just as it actually happened (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 27:8–12'>27:8–12</a> ). The providence of God kept David from fighting against Yahweh’s anointed and his own countrymen. <a ref='1 Samuel 29:9'>29:9</a> <b>an angel of God.</b> The degree to which Achish praised David has led some to believe that his eulogy was merely a formal attempt at flattery. <a ref='1 Samuel 29:11'>29:11</a> <b>Jezreel.</b> This was used to designate both a city about 56 mi. north of Jerusalem as well as the plain of Jezreel, which served as a major battlefield for many nations. The city was situated in the territory of Issachar ( <a ref='Joshua 19:18'>Jos 19:18</a> ). It was bounded on the north and south by Megiddo and Beth-shean ( <a ref='1 Kings 4:12'>1Ki 4:12</a> ) and on the west and east by Mt. Carmel and Mt. Gilboa. <a ref='1 Samuel 30:1'>30:1</a> <b>Ziklag.</b> Serving as a temporary place of residence for David and his 600 men, Ziklag was located in the Negev and given to David by Achish the king of Gath ( <a ref='1 Samuel 27:6'>27:6</a> ). David used it as the base from which he would make raids on the neighboring tribes ( <a ref='1 Samuel 27:8–11'>27:8–11</a> ). <b>Amalekites.</b> Reaping the consequences of Saul’s failure to devote the Amalekites to destuction ( <a ref='1Sa 15'>1Sa 15</a> ) and David’s raids against them ( <a ref='1 Samuel 27:8'>27:8</a> ), David and his men were the victims of a successful raid in which the Amalekites took all of their wives and livestock captive before burning Ziklag, their city. <a ref='1 Samuel 30:6'>30:6</a> <b>distressed … embittered.</b> Arriving home to the reality of their great tragedy caused David immense distress and provoked the wickedness of his men to entertain the treasonous idea of stoning him. Having not inquired of Yahweh before his departure to support Achish in battle, David was in need of God’s getting his attention. <b>strengthened himself in Yahweh his God.</b> This was the key to David being a man after God’s heart (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 13:14'>1Sa 13:14</a> ; <a ref='Acts 13:22'>Ac 13:22</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 30:7'>30:7</a> <b>Abiathar brought the ephod.</b> Serving as a source through which one could make direct and specific inquiry into the will of God, the High Priest’s ephod, which contained the Urim and Thummim, was sought by David. The distress of the moment drew his focus away from the treasonous thoughts of his men and back to God in his desperation to know what God would have him do. <a ref='1 Samuel 30:9–10'>30:9–10</a> <b>brook Besor.</b> David most likely encountered the brook about 13 mi. south of Ziklag. It consisted of seasonal rivers from the area of Beersheba which ran northwest and emptied into the Mediterranean. Likely, this was during the latter rains (Jan.–Apr.) and the brook was filled with a rampaging runoff that would account for the soldiers who were unable to cross over. <a ref='1 Samuel 30:14'>30:14</a> <b>Negev of the Cherethites.</b> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites ( <a ref='2 Samuel 8:18'>2Sa 8:18</a> ), who are almost always mentioned together. They fled Jerusalem as allies with David ( <a ref='2 Samuel 15:18'>2Sa 15:18</a> ), and pursued Sheba the son of Bichri with Joab ( <a ref='2 Samuel 20:7'>2Sa 20:7</a> ). They were hand-picked by David to be present at Solomon’s anointing as king. The Cherethites appear to have come from Crete, and to have been a part of the king’s bodyguard ( <a ref='2 Samuel 23:20'>2Sa 23:20</a> , <a ref='2 Samuel 23:23'>23</a> ). <b>Negev of Caleb.</b> Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, was one of 12 spies chosen to check out the Land, and one of only 2 spies who gave a favorable report ( <a ref='Numbers 13:6–30'>Nu 13:6–30</a> ). This was the land assigned to his family ( <a ref='Joshua 14:13–14'>Jos 14:13–14</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 30:16'>30:16</a> <b>all the great spoil.</b> The Amalekites had not only what they took from Ziklag, but much more plunder from all their raids. After David conquered the Amalekites (vv. <a ref='1 Samuel 30:17–18'>17–18</a> ) he returned what belonged to Ziklag (vv. <a ref='1 Samuel 30:19'>19</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 30:26'>26</a> ) and spread the rest all over Judah (vv. <a ref='1 Samuel 30:26–31'>26–31</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 30:17'>30:17</a> <b>four hundred young men.</b> It is obvious from Moses’ encounter ( <a ref='Exodus 17:8–16'>Ex 17:8–16</a> ), Saul’s failure ( <a ref='1Sa 15'>1Sa 15</a> ), and Mordecai’s opposition ( <a ref='Es 3:1'>Es 3:1</a> , <a ref='Es 3:10–13'>10–13</a> ) that the Amalekites were wicked people who hated God’s people and died hard. <a ref='1 Samuel 30:19'>30:19</a> <b>nothing … was missing.</b> In spite of David’s previous failures, God showed Himself to be more than gracious and abundant in His stewardship of the wives, children, livestock, and possessions of David and his men. <a ref='1 Samuel 30:22'>30:22</a> <b>vile men.</b> From the beginning of David’s flight from Saul, he became captain of those who were in distress, discontent, and in debt ( <a ref='1 Samuel 22:2'>22:2</a> ), the least likely to exercise kindness and grace to others. This same expression was used of the sons of Eli ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:12'>2:12</a> ), of those who doubted Saul’s ability as king ( <a ref='1 Samuel 10:27'>10:27</a> ), of Nabal the fool by his servant ( <a ref='1 Samuel 25:17'>25:17</a> ), of Nabal the fool by his wife ( <a ref='1 Samuel 25:25'>25:25</a> ), of David when he was cursed by Shimei ( <a ref='2 Samuel 16:7'>2Sa 16:7</a> ), of Sheba the son of Bichri who led a revolt against David ( <a ref='2 Samuel 20:1'>2Sa 20:1</a> ), and of those who would be thrust away like thorns by David ( <a ref='2 Samuel 23:6'>2Sa 23:6</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 30:25'>30:25</a> <b>a statute and a judgment.</b> In spite of the opposition David received from the vile men among him, he legislated his practice of kindness and equity into law for the people. <a ref='1 Samuel 30:26–31'>30:26–31</a> Being no stranger to adversity and a life lived on the run, David realized the important role that so many others had played in his safety and welfare. Being the recipient of such kindness, David missed no opportunity to reciprocate kindness and generosity. It would be presumptuous to think that David was merely paying off debts or buying support; rather he was giving back as he had received, expressing his debt of gratitude for the kindness and support shown him. <i>See note on <a ref='1 Samuel 30:16'>30:16</a> .</i> <a ref='1 Samuel 31:1–13'>31:1–13</a> See <a ref='2 Samuel 1:4–12'>2Sa 1:4–12</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 10:1–12'>1Chr 10:1–12</a> . <a ref='1 Samuel 31:1'>31:1</a> <b>Mount Gilboa.</b> Formerly the site of the Israeli camp, it was turned into the sight of the Israeli massacre. Saul and his sons lost their lives on Mt. Gilboa. <i>See note on <a ref='1 Samuel 28:4'>28:4</a> .</i> <a ref='1 Samuel 31:2'>31:2</a> <b>Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua.</b> Three of the 4 sons of Saul were killed the same day in battle. The fourth son, Eshbaal, would later be referred to as Ish-bosheth, meaning “man of shame,” an appropriate designation in light of his apparent absence from the battlefield (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 2:8'>2Sa 2:8ff.</a> ). Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua were named as Saul’s sons in <a ref='1 Samuel 14:49'>14:49</a> , but Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchi-shua are named here; Ishvi and Abinadab are thus one and the same. <a ref='1 Chronicles 8:33'>First Chronicles 8:33</a> and <a ref='1 Chronicles 9:39'>9:39</a> are the only verses naming all 4 sons. <a ref='1 Samuel 31:4'>31:4</a> <b>these uncircumcised.</b> A common term of derision used among Israelites to designate non-Israelites. Circumcision was given as the sign of the Abrahamic Covenant in <a ref='Genesis 17:10–14'>Ge 17:10–14</a> . <i>See note on <a ref='1 Samuel 14:6'>14:6</a> .</i> <b>abuse.</b> Having engaged in several battles against the Philistines, Saul had succeeded in provoking their hatred and resentment. As the king, Saul had certainly received especially cruel treatment from the hands of his enemies, who would have likely made sport of him and tortured him before his death. <b>Saul took his sword and fell on it.</b> Though Saul’s suicide is considered by some to be an act of heroism, Saul should have found his strength and courage in God as David did in <a ref='1 Samuel 23:16'>23:16</a> and <a ref='1 Samuel 30:6'>30:6</a> to fight to the end or to surrender. Saul’s suicide is the ultimate expression of his faithlessness towards God at this moment in his life. <a ref='1 Samuel 31:6'>31:6</a> <b>all his men.</b> The question is whether “all” was used in a qualified sense or in an absolute sense. In consideration of the context, the meaning was most likely intended to be qualified, not absolute. It is not necessary to conclude that every single one of Saul’s 3,000 men died that day and that none escaped. Where such a meaning is intended, the text usually provides more reinforcement, as in <a ref='Joshua 8:22'>Jos 8:22</a> where the author specifically states, “and they struck them down until there was no one remaining for him who survived or escaped.” In fact, Abner, the general of Saul’s army, survived ( <a ref='2 Samuel 2:8'>2Sa 2:8</a> ). “All” here means those who were personally assigned to Saul’s special guard (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 31:7'>31:7</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 31:9'>31:9</a> <b>cut off his head.</b> There is a parallelism between the death of Saul and the death of Goliath. The giant champion of the Philistines had his head cut off by David, and the Philistines fled ( <a ref='1 Samuel 17:51'>17:51</a> ). The Philistines had taken revenge and done likewise to the giant champion of Israel, King Saul, who was “taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward” ( <a ref='1 Samuel 10:23'>10:23</a> ). <a ref='1 Samuel 31:10'>31:10</a> <b>Ashtaroth.</b> These were the fertility goddesses of the Canaanites, to whom the Philistines gave homage by placing the weapons of their defeated foe in the temple of Ashtaroth. As the sword of Goliath was put in the house of Yahweh behind the ephod ( <a ref='1 Samuel 21:9'>1Sa 21:9</a> ), so the weapons of Saul were taken by the Philistines and put in the temple of Ashtaroth. Military victory was attributed to the gods, since the belief was that military encounters were battles between the deities of rival nations. <b>Beth-shan.</b> Located in the Jordan Valley about 16 mi. south of the Sea of Galilee. <a ref='1 Samuel 31:11'>31:11</a> <b>Jabesh-gilead.</b> Located east of the Jordan, its people stayed out of the war against Benjamin and suffered severe consequences as a result ( <a ref='Jdg 21'>Jdg 21</a> ). The men of Jabesh-gilead showed kindness and respect to Saul, a Benjamite, by rescuing his body from the wall of Beth-shan because Saul and his sons had saved Jabesh-gilead from the Ammonites ( <a ref='1 Samuel 11:9–12'>11:9–12</a> ) just after he had been chosen as king of Israel. By this act, they honored Saul for his faithfulness to them. <a ref='1 Samuel 31:12'>31:12</a> <b>bodies … burned.</b> In light of Saul’s head having been cut off and the mutilation that had taken place, it is thought that the citizens of Jabesh-gilead burned his body to hide the damage. <a ref='1 Samuel 31:13'>31:13</a> <b>bones … buried.</b> It was considered disrespectful not to bury the dead. Abraham went to great lengths to bury Sarah ( <a ref='Genesis 23:4–15'>Ge 23:4–15</a> ), and Jacob made Joseph swear that he would not bury him in Egypt ( <a ref='Genesis 47:29–30'>Ge 47:29–30</a> ). <b>fasted seven days.</b> In relation to death, fasting was often associated with mourning in the Hebrew culture. It was a sign of respect, seriousness, and grief. First Samuel began with the ark of the covenant being captured by the Philistines ( <a ref='1 Samuel 4:11'>1Sa 4:11</a> ), and in the end Israel’s king had been killed by them. Second Samuel will recount how God vindicated His honor by David’s defeating the Philistines ( <a ref='2 Samuel 5:17–25'>2Sa 5:17–25</a> ), establishing an uncontested kingdom ( <a ref='1 Kings 2:12'>1Ki 2:12</a> ), and safely bringing the ark to Jerusalem, the city of God ( <a ref='2 Samuel 6:16–19'>2Sa 6:16–19</a> ).
