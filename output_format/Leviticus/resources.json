    "content": "Leviticus Title The original Hebrew title of this third book of the law is taken from the first word, translated “And He called.” Several OT books derive their Hebrew names in the same manner (e.g., Genesis, “In the beginning”; Exodus, “Now these are the names”). The title “Leviticus” comes from the Latin Vulgate version of the Greek OT (LXX) <i>Leuitikon</i> meaning “matters of the Levites” ( <a ref='Leviticus 25:32–33'>25:32–33</a> ). While the book addresses issues of the Levites’ responsibilities, much more significantly all the priests are instructed in how they are to assist the people in worship, and the people are informed about how to live a holy life. New Testament writers quote the book of Leviticus over 15 times. Author and Date Authorship and date issues are resolved by the concluding verse of the book, “These are the commandments which Yahweh commanded Moses for the sons of Israel at Mount Sinai” ( <a ref='Leviticus 27:34'>27:34</a> ; cf. <a ref='Leviticus 7:38'>7:38</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 25:1'>25:1</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 26:46'>26:46</a> ). The fact that God gave these laws to Moses (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 1:1'>1:1</a> ) appears 56 times in Leviticus’ 27 chapters. In addition to recording detailed prescriptions, the book chronicles several historical accounts relating to the laws (see <a ref='Le 8-10'>8–10</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 24:10–23'>24:10–23</a> ). The Exodus occurred in 1445 BC (see Introduction to Exodus: Author and Date ) and the tabernacle was finished one year later ( <a ref='Exodus 40:17'>Ex 40:17</a> ). Leviticus picks up the record at that point, probably revealed in the first month (Abib/Nisan) of the second year after the Exodus. The book of Numbers begins after that in the second month (Ziv; cf. <a ref='Numbers 1:1'>Nu 1:1</a> ). Background and Setting Before the year that Israel camped at Mt. Sinai: 1) the presence of God’s glory had never formally resided among the Israelites; 2) a central place of worship, like the tabernacle, had never existed; 3) a structured and regulated set of sacrifices and feasts had not been given; and 4) a High Priest, a formal priesthood, and a cadre of tabernacle workers had not been appointed. As Exodus concluded, features one and two had been accomplished, thereby requiring that elements three and four be inaugurated, which is where Leviticus fits in. <a ref='Exodus 19:6'>Exodus 19:6</a> called Israel to be “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” Leviticus in turn is God’s instruction for His newly redeemed people, teaching them how to worship and obey Him. Israel had, up to that point, only the historical records of the patriarchs from which to gain their knowledge of how to worship and live before their God. Having been slaves for centuries in Egypt, the land of a seemingly infinite number of gods, their concept of worship and the godly life was severely distorted. Their tendency to hold on to polytheism and pagan ritual is witnessed in the wilderness wanderings, e.g., when they worshiped the golden calf (cf. <a ref='Ex 32'>Ex 32</a> ). God would not permit them to worship in the ways of their Egyptian neighbors, nor would He tolerate Egyptian ideas about morality and sin. With the instructions in Leviticus, the priests could lead Israel in worship appropriate to the Lord. Even though the book contains a great deal of law, it is presented in a historical format. Immediately after Moses supervised the construction of the tabernacle, God came in glory to dwell there; this marked the close of the book of Exodus ( <a ref='Exodus 40:34–38'>40:34–38</a> ). Leviticus begins with God calling Moses from the tabernacle and ends with God’s commands to Moses in the form of binding legislation. Israel’s King had occupied His palace (the tabernacle), instituted His law, and declared Himself a covenant partner with His subjects. No geographical movement occurs in this book. The people of Israel stay at the foot of Sinai, the mountain where God came down to give His law ( <a ref='Leviticus 25:1'>25:1</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 26:46'>26:46</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 27:34'>27:34</a> ). They were still there one month later when the record of Numbers began (cf. <a ref='Numbers 1:1'>Nu 1:1</a> ). Historical and Theological Themes The core ideas around which Leviticus develops are the holy character of God and the will of God for Israel’s holiness. God’s holiness, mankind’s sinfulness, sacrifice, and God’s presence in the sanctuary are the book’s most common themes. With a clear, authoritative tone, the book sets forth instruction toward personal holiness at the urging of God ( <a ref='Leviticus 11:44–45'>11:44–45</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 19:2'>19:2</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 20:7'>20:7</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 20:26'>26</a> ; cf. <a ref='1 Peter 1:14–16'>1Pe 1:14–16</a> ). Matters pertaining to Israel’s life of faith tend to focus on purity in ritual settings, but not to the exclusion of concerns regarding Israel’s personal purity. In fact, there is a continuing emphasis on personal holiness in response to the holiness of God (cf. this emphasis in chaps. <a ref='Le 17-27'>17–27</a> ). On over 125 occasions, Leviticus indicts mankind for uncleanness and/or instructs on how to be purified. The motive for such holiness is stated in two repeated phrases: “I am Yahweh” and “I am holy.” These are used over 50 times. <i>See note on <a ref='Leviticus 11:44–45'>11:44–45</a> .</i> The theme of the conditional Mosaic Covenant resurfaces throughout the book, but particularly in chap. <a ref='Le 26'>26</a> . This contract for the new nation not only details the consequences for obedience or disobedience to the covenant stipulations, but it does so in a manner scripted for determining Israel’s history. One cannot help but recognize prophetic implications in the punishments for disobedience; they sound like the events of the much later Babylonian deportment, captivity, and subsequent return to the land almost 900 years after Moses wrote Leviticus (ca. 538 BC). The eschatological implications for Israel’s disobedience will not conclude until Messiah comes to introduce His kingdom and end the curses of <a ref='Le 26'>Lv 26</a> and <a ref='De 28'>Dt 28</a> (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 14:11'>Zec 14:11</a> ). The 5 sacrifices and offerings were symbolic. Their design was to allow the truly penitent and thankful worshiper to express faith in and love for God by the observance of these rituals. When the heart was not penitent and thankful, God was not pleased with the ritual. Cf. <a ref='Amos 5:21–27'>Am 5:21–27</a> . The offerings were burnt, symbolizing the worshiper’s desire to be purged of sin and sending up the fragrant smoke of true worship to God. The myriad of small details in the execution of the rituals was to teach exactness and precision that would extend to the way the people obeyed the moral and spiritual laws of God and the way they revered every facet of His Word. Interpretive Challenges Leviticus is both a manual for the worship of God in Israel and a theology of Old Covenant ritual. Comprehensive understanding of the ceremonies, laws, and ritual details prescribed in the book is difficult today because Moses assumed a certain context of historical understanding. Once the challenge of understanding the detailed prescriptions has been met, the question arises as to how believers in the church should respond to them, since the NT clearly abrogates OT ceremonial law (cf. <a ref='Acts 10:1–16'>Ac 10:1–16</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:16–17'>Col 2:16–17</a> ), the levitical priesthood (cf. <a ref='1 Peter 2:9'>1Pe 2:9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 1:6'>Rev 1:6</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 5:10'>5:10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:6'>20:6</a> ), and the sanctuary (cf. <a ref='Matthew 27:51'>Mt 27:51</a> ), as well as instituting the New Covenant (cf. <a ref='Matthew 26:28'>Mt 26:28</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 3:6–18'>2Co 3:6–18</a> ; <a ref='Heb 7-10'>Heb 7–10</a> ). Rather than try to practice the old ceremonies or look for some deeper spiritual significance in them, the focus should be on the holy and divine character behind them. This may partly be the reason that explanations which Moses often gave in the prescriptions for cleanness offer greater insight into the mind of God than do the ceremonies themselves. The spiritual principles in which the rituals were rooted are timeless because they are embedded in the nature of God. The NT makes it clear that from Pentecost forward (cf. <a ref='Ac 2'>Ac 2</a> ), the church is under the authority of the New Covenant, not the Old (cf. <a ref='Heb 7-10'>Heb 7–10</a> ). The interpreter is challenged to compare features of this book with NT writers who present types or analogies based on the tabernacle and the ceremonial aspects of the law, so as to teach valuable lessons about Christ and New Covenant reality. Though the ceremonial law served only as a shadow of the reality of Christ and His redemptive work ( <a ref='Hebrews 10:1'>Heb 10:1</a> ), excessive typology is to be rejected. Only that which NT writers identify as types of Christ should be so designated (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 5:7'>1Co 5:7</a> , “Christ, our Passover lamb”). The most profitable study in Leviticus is that which yields truth in the understanding of sin, guilt, substitutionary death, and atonement by focusing on features which are not explained or illustrated elsewhere in OT Scripture. Later OT authors, and especially NT writers, build on the basic understanding of these matters provided in Leviticus. The sacrificial features of Leviticus point to their ultimate, one-time fulfillment in the substitutionary death of Jesus Christ ( <a ref='Hebrews 9:11–22'>Heb 9:11–22</a> ). Outline <a ref='Le 1-16'>Leviticus 1–16</a> explains how to have personal access to God through appropriate worship and <a ref='Le 17-27'>Leviticus 17–27</a> details how to be spiritually acceptable to God through an obedient walk.

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Leviticus 1:1–7:38'>1:1—7:38</a> This section provides laws pertaining to sacrifice. For the first time in Israel’s history, a well-defined set of sacrifices was given to them, although people had offered sacrifices since the time of Abel and Cain (cf. <a ref='Genesis 4:3–4'>Ge 4:3–4</a> ). This section contains instructions for the people ( <a ref='Leviticus 1:1–6:7'>1:1—6:7</a> ) and the priests ( <a ref='Leviticus 6:8–7:38'>6:8—7:38</a> ). For a comparison with the millennial kingdom sacrifices, <i>see notes on <a ref='Eze 45-46'>Eze 45–46</a></i> . <a ref='Leviticus 1:1–6:7'>1:1—6:7</a> God had taken the nation at its word, “All that Yahweh has spoken we will do” ( <a ref='Exodus 19:8'>Ex 19:8</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 24:3–8'>24:3–8</a> ), and gave detailed instructions as to how they were to sacrifice to Him. Five sacrifices were outlined: the first 3 were voluntary, the last 2 compulsory. They were: 1) burnt offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 1:1–17'>1:1–17</a> ); 2) grain offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 2:1–16'>2:1–16</a> ); 3) peace offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 3:1–17'>3:1–17</a> ); 4) sin offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 4:1–5:13'>4:1—5:13</a> ); and 5) trespass or guilt offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 5:14–6:7'>5:14—6:7</a> ). All these offerings were forms of worship to God, to give expression of the penitent and thankful heart. Those who were truly God’s by faith gave these offerings with an attitude of worship; for the rest, they were external rituals only. <a ref='Leviticus 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>Yahweh called to Moses.</b> Leviticus begins where Exodus left off (see Introduction: Author and Date; Background and Setting ). No sooner did the glory cloud come down to rest on the tabernacle in the concluding verses of Exodus than God instructed Moses with the content in Leviticus. The question of how to use the tabernacle in worship is answered here by an audible voice from the Divine Glory over the ark in the Holy of Holies (cf. <a ref='Exodus 40:34'>Ex 40:34</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 7:89'>Nu 7:89</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 80:1'>Ps 80:1</a> ). <b>tent of meeting.</b> This is so named since it was the place where Israel would gather to meet Yahweh (cf. <a ref='Exodus 25:8'>Ex 25:8</a> , <a ref='Exodus 25:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 26:1–37'>26:1–37</a> ). See <a ref='Ex 25-32'>Ex 25–32</a> for a detailed description of the tabernacle. <a ref='Leviticus 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>Speak to the sons of Israel.</b> This is essential revelation, with reference to their spiritual life, for all the descendants of Jacob, who was also called Israel (cf. <a ref='Genesis 32:28'>Ge 32:28</a> ). <b>When any man from among you brings.</b> These were completely voluntary and freewill offerings with no specific number or frequency given ( <a ref='Leviticus 1:3'>1:3</a> ). The regulation excluded horses, dogs, pigs, camels, and donkeys, which were used in pagan sacrifices, as well as rabbits, deer, beasts, and birds of prey. The sacrifice had to be from the offerer’s herd, or he had to purchase it. <b>an offering.</b> The Pharisees manipulated this simple concept so that adult children could selfishly withhold the material goods which would help their parents, under the guise of <i>Corban</i> , that it was dedicated to Yahweh (cf. <a ref='Mark 7:8–13'>Mk 7:8–13</a> ). <b>herd … flock.</b> These terms refer to the cattle ( <a ref='Leviticus 1:3'>1:3</a> ), sheep, or goats ( <a ref='Leviticus 1:10'>1:10</a> ) respectively. Only domestic animals could be sacrificed. <a ref='Leviticus 1:3–17'>1:3–17</a> See <a ref='Leviticus 6:8–13'>6:8–13</a> for the priests’ instructions. The burnt offerings were the first sacrifices revealed because these were the ones to be most frequently offered: every morning and evening ( <a ref='Numbers 28:1–8'>Nu 28:1–8</a> ), every Sabbath ( <a ref='Numbers 28:9–10'>Nu 28:9–10</a> ), the first day of each month ( <a ref='Numbers 28:11–15'>Nu 28:11–15</a> ), and at the special feasts ( <a ref='Numbers 28:16–29:40'>Nu 28:16—29:40</a> ). This offering signified voluntary and complete dedication and consecration to Yahweh. It was an offering of repentance for sins committed, with the desire to be purged from the guilt of sinful acts. Designed to demonstrate the sinner’s penitence and obedience, it indicated his self-dedication to the worship of God. The most costly animal was mentioned first; the least costly last. The singing of psalms later became a part of this ritual (cf. <a ref='Ps 4'>Pss 4</a> ; <a ref='Ps 5'>5</a> ; <a ref='Ps 40'>40</a> ; <a ref='Ps 50'>50</a> ; <a ref='Ps 66'>66</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 1:3–9'>1:3–9</a> This section describes the sacrifice of bulls ( <a ref='Leviticus 1:5'>1:5</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>burnt offering.</b> This offering is so called because it required that the animal be completely consumed by the fire, except for the crop of feathers of a bird ( <a ref='Leviticus 1:16'>1:16</a> ) or skin of the bull, which went to the priest ( <a ref='Leviticus 1:6'>1:6</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 7:8'>7:8</a> ). <b>a male without blemish.</b> Since no animal with any deformity or defect was permitted, the priests would inspect each animal, perhaps using a method which the Egyptians employed in their sacrifices, calling for all inspected and approved animals to have a certificate attached to the horns and sealed with wax. A male without defect was required, as it was the choicest offering of the flock. <b>near to the doorway … before Yahweh.</b> This entrance to the courtyard around the tabernacle where the altar of burnt offering stood ( <a ref='Exodus 40:6'>Ex 40:6</a> ) would place the one offering a sacrifice on the north side of the altar (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 1:11'>1:11</a> ). God’s presence in the cloud rested upon the mercy seat of the ark in the Holy of Holies inside the tabernacle proper ( <i>see note on <a ref='Leviticus 1:1'>1:1</a></i> ). The offering was brought to and offered before Yahweh, not before man. Christ in the Levitical Offerings Offering Christ’s Provision Christ’s Character 1. Burnt Offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 1:3–17'>Lv 1:3–17</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 6:8–13'>6:8–13</a> ) atonement Christ’s sinless nature 2. Grain Offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 2:1–16'>Lv 2:1–16</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 6:14–23'>6:14–23</a> ) dedication/consecration Christ was wholly devoted to the Father’s purposes 3. Peace Offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 3:1–17'>Lv 3:1–17</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 7:11–36'>7:11–36</a> ) reconciliation/fellowship Christ was at peace with God 4. Sin Offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 4:1–5:13'>Lv 4:1—5:13</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 6:24–30'>6:24–30</a> ) propitiation Christ’s substitutionary death 5. Guilt Offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 5:14–6:7'>Lv 5:14—6:7</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 7:1–10'>7:1–10</a> ) repentance Christ paid it all for redemption Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Leviticus 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>lay his hand on the head.</b> This symbolic gesture pictured the transfer of the sacrificer’s sin to the sacrificial animal and was likely done with a prayer of repentance and request for forgiveness (cf. <a ref='Psalms 51:18–19'>Ps 51:18–19</a> ). <b>make atonement.</b> The word means “cover.” The psalmist defines it by saying, “Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin <i>is</i> covered” ( <a ref='Psalms 32:1'>Ps 32:1</a> ). Theologically, the “atonement” of the OT covered sin only temporarily, but it did not eliminate sin or later judgment ( <a ref='Hebrews 10:4'>Heb 10:4</a> ). The one time sacrifice of Jesus Christ fully atoned for sin, thus satisfying God’s wrath forever and insuring eternal salvation (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 9:12'>Heb 9:12</a> ; <a ref='1 John 2:2'>1Jn 2:2</a> ), even to those who put saving faith in God for their redemption before Christ’s death on the cross (cf. <a ref='Romans 3:25–26'>Ro 3:25–26</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:15'>Heb 9:15</a> ). <b>on his behalf.</b> This was a substitutionary sacrifice that prefigured the ultimate substitute—Jesus Christ (cf. <a ref='Is 53'>Is 53</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a></i> ). <a ref='Leviticus 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>he shall slaughter.</b> Making vivid and dramatic the consequences of sin, the person offering the sacrifice killed and butchered the animal (cf. v. <a ref='Leviticus 1:6'>6</a> ). <b>Aaron’s sons.</b> This refers to the immediate descendants of Aaron, i.e., Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar (cf. <a ref='Exodus 28:1'>Ex 28:1</a> ). In the beginning, there were 5 priests, including Aaron, who served as the High Priest. <b>shall bring near … splash the blood.</b> The priest had to collect the blood in a basin and then offer it to God as a sacrifice to indicate that a life had been taken, i.e., death occurred (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 17:11'>17:11</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 17:14'>14</a> ). The price of sin is always death (cf. <a ref='Genesis 2:17'>Ge 2:17</a> ; <a ref='Romans 6:23'>Ro 6:23</a> ). <b>the altar.</b> The altar of burnt offering (cf. <a ref='Exodus 27:1–8'>Ex 27:1–8</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 38:1–7'>38:1–7</a> ), which is in the courtyard outside of the tabernacle proper. The prototype experience, before the tabernacle was constructed, is remembered in <a ref='Exodus 24:1–8'>Ex 24:1–8</a> . <a ref='Leviticus 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>wash.</b> This allowed the one sacrificing to cleanse the animal of excrement and thus make it clean. <b>a soothing aroma.</b> The pleasant smell of burning meat signified the sacrifice of obedience which was pleasing to Yahweh. While the costly ritual recognized God’s anger for sin committed (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 1:13'>1:13</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 1:17'>17</a> ), the penitent heart behind the sacrifice made it acceptable. That was far more significant than the sacrifice itself (cf. <a ref='Genesis 8:21'>Ge 8:21</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 15:22'>1Sa 15:22</a> ). This is the first of 3 freewill offerings to please Yahweh; cf. the grain offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 2:2'>2:2</a> ) and the peace offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 3:5'>3:5</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 1:10–13'>1:10–13</a> <b>from the flock.</b> This section describes the sacrifice of sheep and goats. <a ref='Leviticus 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>side … northward.</b> This placed the one sacrificing in front of the tabernacle door (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 1:3'>1:3</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 1:14–17'>1:14–17</a> <b>of birds.</b> This section describes the sacrifice of birds. God does not ask the poor to bring the same burnt offering as those financially well off because the relative cost to the one sacrificing was an important factor. This is the kind of sacrifice brought by Joseph and Mary on the eighth day after Christ’s birth for Mary’s purification (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 12:8'>12:8</a> ; <a ref='Luke 2:22–24'>Lk 2:22–24</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 1:15'>1:15</a> <b>the priest … wring off.</b> Unlike the livestock being killed by the one offering the sacrifice, the bird was killed by the priest. <a ref='Leviticus 1:16'>1:16</a> <b>crop … feathers.</b> This refers to the neck or gullet of a bird, where food was stored. <b>eastward … place of the ashes.</b> This was the closest side to the entrance of the tabernacle compound and provided for the easiest removal of the ashes outside (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 6:10–11'>6:10–11</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 2:1–16'>2:1–16</a> See <a ref='Leviticus 6:14–23'>6:14–23</a> for the priests’ instructions. The grain offering signified homage and thanksgiving to God as a voluntary offering which was offered along with a burnt offering and a drink offering at the appointed sacrifices (cf. <a ref='Numbers 28:1–15'>Nu 28:1–15</a> ). Three variations were prescribed: 1) uncooked flour ( <a ref='Leviticus 2:1–3'>2:1–3</a> ); 2) baked flour ( <a ref='Leviticus 2:4–13'>2:4–13</a> ); or 3) roasted first fruit grain from the harvest ( <a ref='Leviticus 2:14–16'>2:14–16</a> ). This was the only non-animal sacrifice of the 5 and shows that there was a place for offering from the fruit of the soil (as in the case of Cain in <a ref='Ge 4'>Ge 4</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 2:1–3'>2:1–3</a> <b>fine flour.</b> The first variation consisted of uncooked flour whose quality of “fine” paralleled the “unblemished” animal in the burnt offering. A portion of this offering was to support the priests (v. <a ref='Leviticus 2:3'>3</a> ).

Only the priest could eat the portion not burned (see <a ref='Leviticus 7:9'>7:9</a> ). The sin offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 6:17'>6:17</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 6:25'>25</a> ) and the trespass offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 6:17'>6:17</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 7:1'>7:1</a> ) are also called “most holy.” <a ref='Leviticus 2:4–13'>2:4–13</a> This variation of the grain offering involved baked flour.

The peace offering symbolizes the peace and fellowship between the true worshiper and God (as a voluntary offering). It was the third freewill offering resulting in a sweet aroma to Yahweh ( <a ref='Leviticus 3:5'>3:5</a> ), which served as the appropriate corollary to the burnt offering of atonement and the grain offering of consecration and dedication. It symbolized the fruit of redemptive reconciliation between a sinner and God (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:18'>2Co 5:18</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 3:1–5'>3:1–5</a> Pertains to cattle, i.e., the herd, used in the peace offering. <a ref='Leviticus 3:1–2'>3:1–2</a> <b>male or female.</b> This is similar to the burnt offering in manner of presentation (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 1:3–9'>1:3–9</a> ), but different in that a female was allowed. <a ref='Leviticus 3:4'>3:4</a> <b>the fat.</b> All of the fat was dedicated to Yahweh ( <a ref='Leviticus 3:3–5'>3:3–5</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 3:9–11'>9–11</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 3:14–16'>14–16</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 3:6–11'>3:6–11</a> Pertains to sheep used in the peace offering. <a ref='Leviticus 3:11'>3:11</a> as <b>food.</b> The sacrifice was intended to symbolize a meal between God and the one offering it, where peace and friendship were epitomized by sharing that meal together. <a ref='Leviticus 3:12–16'>3:12–16</a> Pertains to goats used in the peace offering. <a ref='Leviticus 3:17'>3:17</a> <b>not eat … fat or … blood.</b> The details given in the chapter distinctly define which fat was to be burned and not eaten, so that whatever adhered to other parts or was mixed with them might be eaten.

The sin offering differed from the guilt offering in that the former involved iniquity where restitution was not possible, while in the latter it was possible. <a ref='Leviticus 4:1–5:13'>4:1—5:13</a> See <a ref='Leviticus 6:24–30'>6:24–30</a> for the priests’ instructions. The sin offering atoned for sins committed unknowingly where restitution was impossible. This was a required sacrifice, as was the guilt offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 5:14–6:7'>5:14—6:7</a> ).

For sins against Yahweh’s property, restitution was made to the priest ( <a ref='Leviticus 5:14–19'>5:14–19</a> ), while restitution was made to the person who suffered loss in other instances ( <a ref='Leviticus 6:1–7'>6:1–7</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 5:15'>5:15</a> <b>shekel of the sanctuary.</b> This amounted to 20 gerahs ( <a ref='Exodus 30:13'>Ex 30:13</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 27:25'>Lv 27:25</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 3:47'>Nu 3:47</a> ) or 2 bekas ( <a ref='Exodus 38:26'>Ex 38:26</a> ), which is the equivalent of four-tenths of one ounce.

Bread ( <a ref='Exodus 29:23–24'>Ex 29:23–24</a> ), meat ( <a ref='Exodus 29:22–24'>Ex 29:22–24</a> ), gold ( <a ref='Exodus 38:24'>Ex 38:24</a> ), oil ( <a ref='Leviticus 14:12'>Lv 14:12</a> ), and grain ( <a ref='Leviticus 23:11'>Lv 23:11</a> ) all served as wave offerings. Another type of offering was the heave offering. Jewish tradition portrayed the wave offering as being presented with a horizontal motion and the heave offering with a vertical motion, as suggested by <a ref='Leviticus 10:15'>Lv 10:15</a> . <a ref='Leviticus 7:36'>7:36</a> <b>He anointed them.</b> See <a ref='Leviticus 8:30'>8:30</a> . <a ref='Leviticus 7:37–38'>7:37–38</a> Moses gives a summary conclusion of <a ref='Leviticus 1:3–7:36'>1:3—7:36</a> . <a ref='Leviticus 7:37'>7:37</a> <b>ordination offering.</b> This refers to the offerings at the ordination of Aaron and his sons (see <a ref='Leviticus 8:14–36'>8:14–36</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 29:1–46'>Ex 29:1–46</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 8:1–10:20'>8:1—10:20</a> Beginnings of the Aaronic priesthood are discussed in this section. Before the time of Aaron, the patriarchs ( <a ref='Genesis 4:3–4'>Ge 4:3–4</a> ) and the fathers ( <a ref='Job 1:5'>Job 1:5</a> ) had offered sacrifices to God, but with Aaron came the fully prescribed priestly service. <a ref='Leviticus 8:1–36'>8:1–36</a> Aaron and his sons were consecrated before they ministered to Yahweh. The consecration of Aaron and his sons had been ordered long before ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Exodus 29:1–28'>Ex 29:1–28</a></i> ), but is here described with all the ceremonial details as it was done after the tabernacle was completed and the regulations for the various sacrifices enacted. <a ref='Leviticus 8:2'>8:2</a> <b>the garments.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Exodus 28:1–43'>Ex 28:1–43</a> .</i> <b>the anointing oil.</b> Oil was used for ceremonial anointing ( <a ref='Leviticus 8:12'>8:12</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 8:30'>30</a> ). <b>sin offering.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Leviticus 4:1–5:13'>4:1—5:13</a> , esp. <a ref='Leviticus 4:3–12'>4:3–12</a> .</i> <a ref='Leviticus 8:6–9'>8:6–9</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Exodus 28:1–43'>Ex 28:1–43</a> .</i> <a ref='Leviticus 8:8'>8:8</a> <b>the Urim and the Thummim.</b> A feature on the breastpiece of the High Priest by which God’s people were given His decision on matters which required a decision. <i>See note on <a ref='Exodus 28:30'>Ex 28:30</a> .</i> <a ref='Leviticus 8:11'>8:11</a> <b>seven times.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Leviticus 4:6'>4:6</a> .</i> <a ref='Leviticus 8:12'>8:12</a> <b>to set him apart as holy.</b> This act was to ceremonially set Aaron apart from the congregation to be a priest unto God, and from the other priests to be High Priest. <a ref='Leviticus 8:14–17'>8:14–17</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Leviticus 4:3–12'>4:3–12</a> .</i> <a ref='Leviticus 8:17'>8:17</a> <b>refuse.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Leviticus 4:11'>4:11</a> .</i> <a ref='Leviticus 8:18–21'>8:18–21</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Leviticus 1:3–17'>1:3–17</a> .</i> <a ref='Leviticus 8:23–24'>8:23–24</a> <b>right ear … right hand … right foot.</b> Using a part to represent the whole, Aaron and his sons were consecrated to listen to God’s holy Word, to carry out His holy assignments, and to live holy lives. <a ref='Leviticus 8:29'>8:29</a> <b>wave offering.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Leviticus 7:30–32'>7:30–32</a> .</i> <a ref='Leviticus 8:35'>8:35</a> <b>keep the charge of Yahweh.</b> The commandment of God ordered Aaron and his sons to do exactly as Yahweh had spoken through Moses.

His glory appeared to Moses in a burning bush in Midian ( <a ref='Exodus 3:1–6'>Ex 3:1–6</a> ), in a cloud on Mt. Sinai ( <a ref='Exodus 24:15–17'>Ex 24:15–17</a> ), and in a rock on Mt. Sinai ( <a ref='Exodus 33:18–23'>Ex 33:18–23</a> ). The glory of God also filled the tabernacle ( <a ref='Exodus 40:34'>Ex 40:34</a> ), led the people as a pillar of fire and cloud ( <a ref='Exodus 40:35–38'>Ex 40:35–38</a> ), and also filled the temple in Jerusalem ( <a ref='1 Kings 8:10–11'>1Ki 8:10–11</a> ). When Aaron made the first sacrifice in the wilderness, as a priest, the “glory of Yahweh appeared to all the people.” In these manifestations, God was revealing His righteousness, holiness, truth, wisdom, and grace—the sum of all He is. However, nowhere has God’s glory been more perfectly expressed than in His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ ( <a ref='John 1:14'>Jn 1:14</a> ). It will be seen on earth again when He returns ( <a ref='Matthew 24:29–31'>Mt 24:29–31</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 25:31'>25:31</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 9:24'>9:24</a> <b>fire came out … consumed.</b> This fire miraculously signified that God had accepted their offering (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 18:38–39'>1Ki 18:38–39</a> ), and the people shouted for joy because of that acceptance and worshiped God. <a ref='Leviticus 10:1'>10:1</a> <b>Nadab and Abihu.</b> These were the two oldest sons of Aaron. <b>firepans.</b> The vessels in which the incense was burned in the Holy Place (its features are unknown) was to be used only for holy purposes. <b>strange fire.</b> Though the exact infraction is not detailed, in some way they violated the prescription for offering incense (cf. <a ref='Exodus 30:9'>Ex 30:9</a> , <a ref='Exodus 30:34–38'>34–38</a> ), probably because they were drunk (see vv. <a ref='Leviticus 10:8–9'>8–9</a> ). Instead of taking the incense fire from the brazen altar, they had some other source for the fire and thus perpetrated an act, which, considering the descent of the miraculous fire they had just seen and their solemn duty to do as God told them, betrayed carelessness, irreverence, and lack of consideration for God. Such a tendency had to be punished for all priests to see as a warning. <a ref='Leviticus 10:2'>10:2</a> <b>fire came out.</b> The same divine fire that accepted the sacrifices ( <a ref='Leviticus 9:24'>9:24</a> ) consumed the errant priests. That was not unlike the later deaths of Uzzah ( <a ref='2 Samuel 6:6–7'>2Sa 6:6–7</a> ) or Ananias and Sapphira ( <a ref='Acts 5:5'>Ac 5:5</a> , <a ref='Acts 5:10'>10</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 10:3'>10:3</a> <b>treated as holy … be glorified.</b> Nadab and Abihu were guilty of violating both requirements of God’s absolute standard. The priests had received repeated and solemn warnings as to the necessity of reverence before God (see <a ref='Exodus 19:22'>Ex 19:22</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 29:44'>29:44</a> ). <b>Aaron kept silent.</b> In spite of losing his two sons, he did not complain, but submitted to the righteous judgment of God. <a ref='Leviticus 10:4'>10:4</a> <b>Mishael … Elzaphan.</b> See <a ref='Exodus 6:22'>Ex 6:22</a> for their lineage. This procedure prevented the priests from defiling themselves by handling the dead bodies ( <a ref='Leviticus 21:1'>Lv 21:1</a> ), and allowed the whole congregation to see the result of such disregard for the holiness of God. <b>outside of the camp.</b> As this was done with the ashes of sacrificed animals ( <a ref='Leviticus 6:11'>6:11</a> ), so it was done with the remains of these two priests who received God’s wrath. <a ref='Leviticus 10:6'>10:6</a> <b>Eleazar and Ithamar.</b> Aaron’s youngest sons who yet lived. Later, the line of Eleazar would be designated as the unique line of the High Priest (cf. <a ref='Numbers 25:10–13'>Nu 25:10–13</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 10:6–7'>10:6–7</a> This prohibition against the customary signs of mourning was usually reserved for the High Priest only as prescribed in <a ref='Leviticus 21:10–12'>21:10–12</a> . Here, Moses applies it to Eleazar and Ithamar also. <a ref='Leviticus 10:8–9'>10:8–9</a> <b>Do not drink wine or strong drink.</b> Taken in its context, this prohibition suggests that intoxication led Nadab and Abihu to perform their blasphemous act. Cf. <a ref='Proverbs 23:20–35'>Pr 23:20–35</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 3:3'>1Ti 3:3</a> ; <a ref='Titus 1:7'>Tit 1:7</a> . <a ref='Leviticus 10:11'>10:11</a> <b>instruct the sons of Israel.</b> It was essential that alcohol not hinder the clarity of their minds, since the priests were to teach God’s law to all of Israel. They were the expositors of the Scripture, alongside the prophets who generally received the Word directly from Yahweh. Ezra would become the supreme example of a commendable priest ( <a ref='Ezra 7:10'>Ezr 7:10</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 10:12–15'>10:12–15</a> <i>See notes on the peace offering in <a ref='Leviticus 3:1–17'>3:1–17</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 7:11–36'>7:11–36</a> .</i> <a ref='Leviticus 10:16–20'>10:16–20</a> The sin offering had not been eaten as prescribed in <a ref='Leviticus 6:26'>6:26</a> , but rather it was wholly burned. It was the duty of the priests to have eaten the meat after the blood was sprinkled on the altar, but instead of eating it in a sacred feast, they had burned it outside the camp. Moses discovered this disobedience, probably from a dread of some further judgment, and challenged, not Aaron, whose heart was too torn in the death of his sons, but the two surviving sons in the priesthood to explain their breach of ritual duty. Aaron, who heard the charge, however, and by whose direction the violation had occurred, gave the explanation. His reason was that they had done all the ritual sacrifice correctly up to the point of eating the meat, but omitted eating because he was too dejected for a feast in the face of the appalling judgments that had fallen. He was wrong, because God had specifically commanded the sin offering to be eaten in the Holy Place. God’s law was clear, and it was sin to deviate from it at all. Moses sympathized with Aaron’s grief, however, and having made his point, dropped the issue. <a ref='Leviticus 11:1–16:34'>11:1—16:34</a> Prescriptions for uncleanness are covered in this section. God used the tangible issues of life which He labeled clean/unclean to repeatedly impress upon Israel the difference between what was holy and unholy. “Clean” means acceptable to God; “unclean” means unacceptable to God. <a ref='Le 11-15'>Leviticus 11–15</a> details the code of cleanness; <a ref='Le 16'>Lv 16</a> returns to sacrifices on the Day of Atonement. <a ref='Leviticus 11:1–47'>11:1–47</a> This section contains further legislation on the consumption of animals. Abel’s offering hints at a “post-Fall/pre-Flood” diet of animals ( <a ref='Genesis 4:4'>Ge 4:4</a> ). After the Noahic flood, God specifically had granted man permission to eat meat ( <a ref='Genesis 9:1–4'>Ge 9:1–4</a> ), but here spelled out the specifics as covenant legislation. All of the reasons for the prohibitions are not specified. The major points were: 1) that Israel was to obey God’s absolute standard, regardless of the reason for it, or the lack of understanding of it; and 2) such a unique diet was specified that Israel would find it difficult to eat with the idolatrous people around and among them. Their dietary laws served as a barrier to easy socialization with idolatrous peoples. Dietary and hygienic benefits were real, but only secondary to the divine purposes of obedience and separation. <a ref='Leviticus 11:3–23'>11:3–23</a> This section is repeated in <a ref='Deuteronomy 14:3–20'>Dt 14:3–20</a> in almost the exact same wording. The subject matter includes animals (vv. <a ref='Leviticus 11:3–8'>3–8</a> ), water life (vv. <a ref='Leviticus 11:9–12'>9–12</a> ), birds (vv. <a ref='Leviticus 11:13–19'>13–19</a> ), and insects (vv. <a ref='Leviticus 11:20–23'>20–23</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 11:4'>11:4</a> <b>camel.</b> The camel has a divided foot of two large parts, but the division is not complete and the two toes rest on an elastic pad. <a ref='Leviticus 11:5–6'>11:5–6</a> <b>shaphan … rabbit.</b> While not true ruminating animals, the manner in which these animals processed their food gave the distinct appearance of “chewing the cud.” <a ref='Leviticus 11:9'>11:9</a> <b>fins and scales.</b> Much like the cud and hoof characteristics, the “no fins and scales” guidelines ruled out a segment of water life commonly consumed by ancient people. <a ref='Leviticus 11:13'>11:13</a> <b>among the birds.</b> Rather than unifying characteristics as in the hoof-cud and no fin-scales descriptions, the forbidden birds were simply named. <a ref='Leviticus 11:21'>11:21</a> This describes the locust (v. <a ref='Leviticus 11:22'>22</a> ), which was allowed for food. <a ref='Leviticus 11:24–43'>11:24–43</a> This section deals with separation from other defiling things. <a ref='Leviticus 11:26–27'>11:26–27</a> These prohibited animals would include horses and donkeys, which have a single hoof, and lion and tigers, which have paws. <a ref='Leviticus 11:30'>11:30</a> <b>gecko.</b> A type of lizard. <a ref='Leviticus 11:36'>11:36</a> <b>a spring or a cistern.</b> The movement and quantity of water determined the probability of actual contamination. Water was scarce also, and it would have been a threat to the water supply if all water touched by these prohibited carcasses was forbidden for drinking. <a ref='Leviticus 11:44–45'>11:44–45</a> <b>set yourselves apart as holy … be holy, for I am holy.</b> In all of this, God is teaching His people to live antithetically. That is, He is using these clean and unclean distinctions to separate Israel from other idolatrous nations who have no such restrictions, and He is illustrating by these prescriptions that His people must learn to live His way. Through dietary laws and rituals, God is teaching them the reality of living His way in everything. They are being taught to obey God in every seemingly mundane area of life, so as to learn how crucial obedience is. Sacrifices, rituals, diet, and even clothing and cooking are all carefully ordered by God to teach them that they are to live differently from everyone else. This is to be an external illustration for the separation from sin in their hearts. Because Yahweh is their God, they are to be utterly distinct. In v. <a ref='Leviticus 11:44'>44</a> , for the first time the statement “I am Yahweh your God” is made, as a reason for the required separation and holiness. After this verse, that phrase is mentioned about 50 more times in this book, along with the equally instructive claim, “I am holy.” Because God is holy and is their God, the people are to be holy in outward ceremonial behavior as an external expression of the greater necessity of heart holiness. The connection between ceremonial holiness carries over into personal holiness. The only motivation given for all these laws is to learn to be holy because God is holy. The holiness theme is central to Leviticus (see <a ref='Leviticus 10:3'>10:3</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 19:2'>19:2</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 20:7'>20:7</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 20:26'>26</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 21:6–8'>21:6–8</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 12:1–8'>12:1–8</a> Uncleanness is related to the mother’s afterbirth, not the child. <a ref='Leviticus 12:2'>12:2</a> <b>menstruation.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Leviticus 15:19–24'>15:19–24</a> .</i> <a ref='Leviticus 12:3'>12:3</a> <b>eighth day.</b> Joseph and Mary followed these instructions at the birth of Christ ( <a ref='Luke 2:21'>Lk 2:21</a> ). <b>circumcised.</b> The sign of the Abrahamic ( <a ref='Genesis 17:9–14'>Ge 17:9–14</a> ) Covenant was incorporated into the laws of Mosaic cleanness. Cf. <a ref='Romans 4:11–13'>Ro 4:11–13</a> . (For a discussion on circumcision, <i>see note on <a ref='Jeremiah 4:4'>Jer 4:4</a></i> .) <a ref='Leviticus 12:5'>12:5</a> <b>two weeks … sixty-six days.</b> Apparently mothers were unclean twice as long (80 days) after the birth of a daughter as a son (40 days), which reflected the stigma on women for Eve’s part in the Fall. This stigma is removed in Christ ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Timothy 2:13–15'>1Ti 2:13–15</a></i> ). <a ref='Leviticus 12:6'>12:6</a> <b>burnt offering … sin offering.</b> Though the occasion was joyous, the sacrifices required were to impress upon the mind of the parent the reality of original sin and that the child had inherited a sin nature. The circumcision involved a cutting away of the male foreskin, which could carry infections and diseases in its folds. This cleansing of the physical organ so as not to pass on disease (Jewish women have historically had the lowest incidence of cervical cancer) was a picture of the deep need for cleansing from depravity, which is most clearly revealed by procreation, as men produce sinners and only sinners. Circumcision points to the fact that cleansing is needed at the very core of a human being, a cleansing God offers to the faithful and penitent through the sacrifice of Christ to come. <a ref='Leviticus 12:8'>12:8</a> <b>turtledoves … pigeons.</b> Cf. <a ref='Leviticus 1:14–17'>Lv 1:14–17</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 5:7–10'>5:7–10</a> . These were the offerings of Joseph and Mary after Christ’s birth (cf. <a ref='Luke 2:24'>Lk 2:24</a> ), when they presented Jesus as their firstborn to Yahweh ( <a ref='Exodus 13:2'>Ex 13:2</a> ; <a ref='Luke 2:22'>Lk 2:22</a> ). Birds, rather than livestock, indicated a low economic situation, though one who was in total poverty could offer flour ( <a ref='Leviticus 5:11–13'>5:11–13</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 13:1–14:57'>13:1—14:57</a> This section covers laws pertaining to skin diseases. <a ref='Leviticus 13:2'>13:2</a> <b>bright spot.</b> This probably refers to inflammation. <b>leprosy.</b> This is a term referring to various ancient skin disorders that were sometimes superficial, sometimes serious. It may have included modern leprosy (Hansen’s disease). The symptoms described in vv. <a ref='Leviticus 13:2'>2</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 13:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 13:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 13:18'>18</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 13:30'>30</a> , and <a ref='Leviticus 13:39'>39</a> are not sufficient for a diagnosis of the clinical condition. For the protection of the people, observation and isolation were demanded for all suspected cases of what could be a contagious disease. This biblical leprosy involved some whiteness (v. <a ref='Leviticus 13:3'>3</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 4:6'>Ex 4:6</a> ), which disfigured its victim but did not disable him. Naaman was able to exercise his functions as general of Syria’s army, although a leper ( <a ref='2 Kings 5:1'>2Ki 5:1</a> , <a ref='2 Kings 5:27'>27</a> ). Both OT and NT lepers went almost everywhere, indicating that this disease was not the leprosy of today that cripples. A victim of this scaly disease was unclean as long as the infection was partial. Once the body was covered with it, he was clean and could enter the place of worship (see vv. <a ref='Leviticus 13:12–17'>12–17</a> ). Apparently the complete covering meant the contagious period was over. The allusion to a boil (vv. <a ref='Leviticus 13:18–28'>18–28</a> ) with inflamed or raw areas and whitened hairs may refer to a related infection that was contagious. When lepers were cured by Christ, they were neither lame nor deformed. They were never brought on beds. Similar skin conditions are described in vv. <a ref='Leviticus 13:29–37'>29–37</a> and vv. <a ref='Leviticus 13:38–44'>38–44</a> (some inflammation from infection). The aim of these laws was to protect the people from disease, but more importantly, to inculcate into them by vivid object lessons how God desired purity, holiness, and cleanness among His people. <a ref='Leviticus 13:45'>13:45</a> <b>“Unclean! Unclean!”</b> Here are the symbols of grief and isolation. This same cry is heard from the survivors of Jerusalem’s destruction (cf. <a ref='Lamentations 4:15'>Lam 4:15</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 13:47–59'>13:47–59</a> Deals with garments worn by infected persons. <a ref='Leviticus 13:59'>13:59</a> <b>pronouncing it clean or unclean.</b> The primary purpose of this legislation was to assist the priest in determining the presence of contagious skin disease. The language of the passage indicates disease that affects the clothes as it did the person. This provided more illustrations of the devastating infection of sin and how essential cleansing was spiritually. <a ref='Leviticus 14:1–32'>14:1–32</a> This section explains the cleansing ritual for healed persons. <a ref='Leviticus 14:2'>14:2</a> <b>the law of the leper.</b> The sense of this law is a prescription, not for healing from leprosy and other such diseases, but rather for the ceremonial cleansing, which needed to be performed after the person was declared clean. <a ref='Leviticus 14:3'>14:3</a> <b>outside of the camp.</b> The leper was not allowed to return to society immediately. Before the person could enter the camp, some priest skilled in the diagnoses of disease needed to examine him and assist with the ritual of the two birds (vv. <a ref='Leviticus 14:4–7'>4–7</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 14:4–7'>14:4–7</a> The bundle of cedar and hyssop tied with scarlet included the living bird. It was all dipped 7 times into the blood of the killed bird mixed with water to symbolize purification.

Leprosy (Hansen’s disease), as we know it today, is not the problem here since it is a disease related to the human senses, i.e., the destruction of feeling due to the dysfunction of the nerves. It is not known to be contagious either, and it couldn’t be developed in a house.

Several types of discharges by men (vv. <a ref='Leviticus 15:1–18'>1–18</a> ) and women (vv. <a ref='Leviticus 15:19–30'>19–30</a> ) are identified and given prescribed treatment. <a ref='Leviticus 15:2–15'>15:2–15</a> These verses describe secretions related to some disease of the male sexual organs. After he became well, he was required to make both a sin and a burnt offering (v. <a ref='Leviticus 15:15'>15</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 15:16–18'>15:16–18</a> These verses refer to natural sexual gland secretions for which no offerings were required. <a ref='Leviticus 15:19–24'>15:19–24</a> These verses concern the natural menstrual discharge of a woman for which no offerings were required. <a ref='Leviticus 15:25–30'>15:25–30</a> These verses deal with some secretion of blood indicating disease, not menstruation, requiring a sin and burnt offering after she is well. <a ref='Leviticus 15:31–33'>15:31–33</a> In all these instructions, God was showing the Israelites that they must have a profound reverence for holy things; and nothing was more suited to that purpose than to bar from the tabernacle all who were polluted by any kind of uncleanness, ceremonial as well as natural, physical as well as spiritual. In order to mark out His people as dwelling before Him in holiness, He required of them complete purity and didn’t allow them to come before Him when defiled, even by involuntary or secret impurities. And when one considers that God was training a people to live in His presence, it becomes apparent that these rules for the maintenance of personal purity, pointing to the necessity of purity in the heart, were neither too stringent nor too minute. <a ref='Leviticus 16:1–34'>16:1–34</a> This section covers the Day of Atonement (cf. <a ref='Exodus 30:10'>Ex 30:10</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 23:26–32'>Lv 23:26–32</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 29:7–11'>Nu 29:7–11</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:1–28'>Heb 9:1–28</a> ), which was commanded to be observed annually (v. <a ref='Leviticus 16:34'>34</a> ) to cover the sins of the nation, both corporately and individually (v. <a ref='Leviticus 16:17'>17</a> ). Even with the most scrupulous observance of the required sacrifices, many sins and defilements still remained unacknowledged and, therefore, without specific expiation. This special inclusive sacrifice was designed to cover all that (v. <a ref='Leviticus 16:33'>33</a> ). The atonement was provided, but only those who were genuine in faith and repentance received its benefit, the forgiveness of God. That forgiveness was not based on any animal sacrifice, but on the One all sacrifices pictured—the Lord Jesus Christ and His perfect sacrifice on the cross (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 10:1–10'>Heb 10:1–10</a> ). This holiest of all Israel’s festivals occurred in Sept./Oct. on the tenth day of the seventh month (v. <a ref='Leviticus 16:29'>29</a> ). It anticipated the ultimate High Priest and the perfect sacrificial Lamb. <a ref='Leviticus 16:1'>16:1</a> The death of the two sons of Aaron. Cf. <a ref='Leviticus 10:1–3'>10:1–3</a> . <a ref='Leviticus 16:2'>16:2</a> Common priests went every day to burn incense on the golden altar in the part of the tabernacle sanctuary outside the veil, where the lampstand, table, and bread of the Presence were. None except the High Priest was allowed to enter inside the veil (cf. v. <a ref='Leviticus 16:12'>12</a> ), into the Holy Place, actually called the Holy of Holies, where the ark of the covenant rested. This arrangement was designed to inspire a reverence for God at a time when His presence was indicated by visible symbols. <b>appear in the cloud.</b> This cloud was likely the smoke of the incense which the High Priest burned on his annual entrance into the Holy of Holies. It was this cloud that covered the mercy seat on the ark of the covenant (see v. <a ref='Leviticus 16:13'>13</a> ). <b>the mercy seat.</b> See <a ref='Exodus 25:17–22'>Ex 25:17–22</a> . It lit. means “place of atonement” and referred to the throne of God between the cherubim (cf. <a ref='Is 6'>Is 6</a> ). It is so named because it was where God manifested Himself for the purpose of atonement. <a ref='Leviticus 16:3'>16:3</a> <b>sin … burnt offering.</b> For these offerings brought by Aaron the High Priest, <i>see notes on <a ref='Leviticus 4:1–5:13'>4:1—5:13</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 6:24–30'>6:24–30</a> and <a ref='Leviticus 1:3–17'>1:3–17</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 6:8–13'>6:8–13</a></i> , respectively. The bull was sacrificed first as a sin offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 16:11–14'>16:11–14</a> ) and later the ram as a burnt offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 16:24'>16:24</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 16:4'>16:4</a> For a description of the priests’ normal clothing, see <a ref='Exodus 28:1–43'>Ex 28:1–43</a> and <a ref='Leviticus 8:6–19'>Lv 8:6–19</a> . He wore them later for the burnt offering (cf. v. <a ref='Leviticus 16:24'>24</a> ). These humbler clothes were less ornate, required for the Day of Atonement to portray the High Priest as God’s humble servant, himself in need of atonement (vv. <a ref='Leviticus 16:11–14'>11–14</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 16:5'>16:5</a> <b>two … goats.</b> See <a ref='Leviticus 16:7–10'>16:7–10</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 16:20–22'>20–22</a> .

This day provided ceremonially cleansing for one year, and pictured the forgiveness of God available to all who believed and repented. Actual atonement was based on cleansing through the sacrifice of Christ (cf. <a ref='Romans 3:25–26'>Ro 3:25–26</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:15'>Heb 9:15</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 16:34'>16:34</a> <b>once every year.</b> The better sacrifice of Jesus Christ was offered once-for-all, never to be repeated (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 9:11–10:18'>Heb 9:11—10:18</a> ).

Blood carries life-sustaining elements to all parts of the body; therefore it represents the essence of life. In contrast, the shedding of blood represents the shedding of life, i.e., death (cf. <a ref='Genesis 9:4'>Ge 9:4</a> ). NT references to the shedding of the blood of Jesus Christ are references to His death. <b>blood that makes atonement.</b> Since it contains the life, blood is sacred to God. Shed blood (death) from a substitute atones for or covers the sinner, who is then allowed to live. <a ref='Leviticus 17:13–14'>17:13–14</a> It was customary with heathen hunters, when they killed any game, to pour out the blood as an offering to the god of the hunt. The Israelites, to the contrary, were enjoined by this directive and banned from all such superstitious acts of idolatry. <a ref='Leviticus 17:15–16'>17:15–16</a> This cleansing was necessary because these animals would not have had the blood drained properly. Cf. <a ref='Exodus 22:31'>Ex 22:31</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 14:21'>Dt 14:21</a> . <a ref='Leviticus 18:1–30'>18:1–30</a> Laws are given, relating to sexual practices, which would eliminate the abominations being practiced by the heathen in the land ( <a ref='Leviticus 18:27'>18:27</a> ; cf. <a ref='Leviticus 20:10–21'>Lv 20:10–21</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:13–30'>Dt 22:13–30</a> ). These specific laws assume the general prohibition of adultery ( <a ref='Exodus 20:14'>Ex 20:14</a> ) and a father incestuously engaging his daughter. They do not necessarily invalidate the special case of a levirate marriage (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:5'>Dt 25:5</a> ). The penalties for such outlawed behavior are detailed in <a ref='Leviticus 20:10–21'>20:10–21</a> . <a ref='Leviticus 18:3'>18:3</a> <b>not do … what is done.</b> Repeating the sexual practices or customs of the Egyptians and Canaanites was forbidden by God. <a ref='Leviticus 18:4'>18:4</a> <b>I am Yahweh your God.</b> This phrase, used over 50 times, asserts the uniqueness of the One True and Living God, who calls His people to holiness as He is holy, and calls them to reject all other gods. <a ref='Leviticus 18:5'>18:5</a> <b>if a man does them, he shall live.</b> Special blessing was promised to the Israelites on the condition of their obedience to God’s law. This promise was remarkably verified in particular eras of their history, in the national prosperity they enjoyed when pure and undefiled religion prevailed among them. Obedience to God’s law always insures temporal blessings, as this verse indicates. But these words have a higher reference to spiritual life as indicated by Yahweh (cf. <a ref='Luke 10:28'>Lk 10:28</a> ) and Paul (cf. <a ref='Romans 10:5'>Ro 10:5</a> ). Obedience does not save from sin and hell, but it does mark those who are saved (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 2:8–9'>Eph 2:8–9</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 2:6–10'>Ro 2:6–10</a></i> ). <a ref='Leviticus 18:6–18'>18:6–18</a> This section deals with consanguinity, i.e., the sins of incest. <a ref='Leviticus 18:6'>18:6</a> <b>uncover nakedness.</b> This is a euphemism for sexual relations. <a ref='Leviticus 18:8'>18:8</a> <b>your father’s wife.</b> Actually a stepmother is in mind here (cf. v. <a ref='Leviticus 18:7'>7</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 18:11'>18:11</a> <b>your sister.</b> Here he is forbidden to marry a stepsister. <a ref='Leviticus 18:18'>18:18</a> <b>while she is alive.</b> The principle on which the prohibitions are made changes slightly. Instead of avoiding sexual involvement because it would violate a relational connection, this situation defaults to the principle of one person at a time, or while the other is still alive, i.e., it forbids polygamy. Commonly in Egyptian, Chaldean, and Canaanite culture, sisters were taken as wives in polygamous unions. God forbids such, as all polygamy is forbidden by the original law of marriage (see <a ref='Genesis 2:24–25'>Ge 2:24–25</a> ). Moses, because of hard hearts, tolerated it, as did others in Israel in the early stages of that nation. But it always led to tragedy. <a ref='Leviticus 18:19'>18:19</a> <b>menstrual impurity.</b> Cf. <a ref='Leviticus 15:24'>15:24</a> . <a ref='Leviticus 18:21'>18:21</a> <b>Molech.</b> This Semitic false deity (god of the Ammonites) was worshiped with child sacrifice (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 20:2–5'>Lv 20:2–5</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 11:7'>1Ki 11:7</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 23:10'>2Ki 23:10</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 32:35'>Jer 32:35</a> ).

See <a ref='Exodus 25:31–40'>Ex 25:31–40</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 27:20–21'>27:20–21</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 37:17–24'>37:17–24</a> and <a ref='Exodus 25:23–30'>Ex 25:23–30</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 39:36'>39:36</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 40:23'>40:23</a> , respectively. <a ref='Leviticus 24:5'>24:5</a> Each loaf was made with 4 quarts of flour. <a ref='Leviticus 24:10–23'>24:10–23</a> This portion relates to the sin of blasphemy. Cf. <a ref='Exodus 20:7'>Ex 20:7</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 22:28'>22:28</a> . <a ref='Leviticus 24:10–14'>24:10–14</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 24:23'>23</a> <b>Now the son.</b> Here is another historical example of blasphemy along similar lines as the Nadab and Abihu account ( <a ref='Leviticus 10:1–2'>10:1–2</a> ). The blasphemer was one of the “many other people.” The people transferred the guilt of them all to him. <a ref='Leviticus 24:12'>24:12</a> <b>put him in custody.</b> There were no jails in Israel since incarceration was not a penalty for crime. They had merely restrained him, probably in a pit of some sort, until they could establish his punishment. Punishments were corporal, banishment, or, in severe cases, death. Those who lived through the punishment worked to secure restitution for those they had violated. <a ref='Leviticus 24:20'>24:20</a> Cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:38'>Mt 5:38</a> . This law of retaliation established the principle that the punishment should fit the crime, but not go beyond it. <a ref='Leviticus 25:1–55'>25:1–55</a> Proper care for Yahweh’s property is prescribed for the sabbatical year ( <a ref='Leviticus 25:1–7'>25:1–7</a> ) and the Jubilee year ( <a ref='Leviticus 25:8–55'>25:8–55</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 25:1–7'>25:1–7</a> This involves revitalization of the land. The seventh year of rest would invigorate and replenish the nutrients in the soil. Whatever grew naturally was free to all for the taking (vv. <a ref='Leviticus 25:6–7'>6–7</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 25:8–55'>25:8–55</a> The Year of Jubilee involved a year of release from indebtedness (vv. <a ref='Leviticus 25:23–38'>23–38</a> ) and bondage of all sorts (vv. <a ref='Leviticus 25:39–55'>39–55</a> ). All prisoners and captives were set free, slaves released, and debtors absolved. All property reverted to original owners. This plan curbed inflation and moderated acquisitions. It also gave new opportunity to people who had fallen on hard times. <a ref='Leviticus 25:8–17'>25:8–17</a> These are general instructions for Jubilee. <a ref='Leviticus 25:9'>25:9</a> <b>ram’s horn.</b> This was blown on the tenth day of the seventh month to start the 50th year of universal redemption. <a ref='Leviticus 25:10'>25:10</a> <b>proclaim a release.</b> Not only must they let the land lie fallow, but the people were allowed a one-year break from their labor. Those bound by a work contract were released from their commitments and there was the release of indentured servants. <a ref='Leviticus 25:14–16'>25:14–16</a> The Jubilee year had an effect on the value of land, which was to be considered in all transactions. <a ref='Leviticus 25:17'>25:17</a> <b>you shall not mistreat one another.</b> No one should take advantage of or abuse another person, because cruelty is against the very character of God. Penalties for crime were to be swift and exact. <a ref='Leviticus 25:18–22'>25:18–22</a> God’s provision in the year of no planting was given, which on a smaller scale had been true for the Sabbath day during the Exodus (cf. <a ref='Exodus 16:5'>Ex 16:5</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 25:20–21'>25:20–21</a> <b>produce for three years.</b> When the important query was asked, God responded by promising to supply enough to last. <a ref='Leviticus 25:23–34'>25:23–34</a> Various regulations regarding real estate are outlined. <a ref='Leviticus 25:23'>25:23</a> <b>the land is Mine.</b> God owns the earth and all that is in it (cf. <a ref='Psalms 24:1'>Ps 24:1</a> ). The people of Israel were, in fact, only tenants on the land by Yahweh’s grace. Therefore ownership of property was temporary, not permanent. <a ref='Leviticus 25:33'>25:33</a> <b>cities of the Levites.</b> Cf. <a ref='Numbers 35:1–8'>Nu 35:1–8</a> ; <a ref='Jos 21'>Jos 21</a> . <a ref='Leviticus 25:34'>25:34</a> <b>pasture fields.</b> These were fields that the village/city-at-large used to grow crops. <a ref='Leviticus 25:35–38'>25:35–38</a> Instructions on dealing with the poor are outlined. <a ref='Leviticus 25:35'>25:35</a> <b>like a sojourner or a foreign resident.</b> The law required gleanings (leftovers after harvest) for the Israelite as well as the stranger (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 19:9–10'>19:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 23:22'>23:22</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:19–21'>Dt 24:19–21</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 25:36'>25:36</a> <b>usurious interest.</b> Usury or excessive interest was prohibited for all ( <a ref='Psalms 15:5'>Ps 15:5</a> ). Even fair interest was otherwise prohibited in dealing with the poor ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:19–20'>Dt 23:19–20</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:10–13'>24:10–13</a></i> ). The basics of life were to be given, not loaned, to the poor. <a ref='Leviticus 25:38'>25:38</a> <b>to give you the land of Canaan.</b> Yahweh cites His generosity in giving them a land that was not theirs as a motive for their generosity toward their countrymen. <a ref='Leviticus 25:39–55'>25:39–55</a> The principles for dealing with slavery are laid out. <a ref='Leviticus 25:42'>25:42</a> <b>For they are My slaves.</b> The spirit of OT slavery is revealed in these words. God, in effect, ordered that slaves be treated like family, i.e., better than employees, because they are His slaves whom He redeemed out of the slave markets of Egypt. God owned not only the land (v. <a ref='Leviticus 25:23'>23</a> ), but also the people. <a ref='Leviticus 25:44–46'>25:44–46</a> <b>from the pagan nations.</b> These slaves included people whom Israel was to either drive out or destroy (i.e., slavery was a humane option) and those who came to Israel in the Exodus from Egypt. <a ref='Leviticus 25:47–55'>25:47–55</a> This section deals with an alien who has an Israelite slave. <a ref='Leviticus 25:48'>25:48</a> <b>redemption right.</b> Redemption, a contractual agreement which existed in the slave culture, offered the potential for emancipation to indentured individuals under certain conditions. Slaves could be bought out of slavery or some other sort of indentured status by family members or other interested parties who would pay the ransom price. <a ref='Leviticus 25:51–54'>25:51–54</a> amount for <b>his redemption.</b> The cost of buying him out of slavery was affected by the Jubilee year, when he could be set free. <a ref='Leviticus 25:55'>25:55</a> The Israelites emancipated from Egypt by God were all God’s servants; therefore, they were to treat their own slaves with the same grace and generosity as God had granted them. <a ref='Leviticus 26:1–46'>26:1–46</a> The covenant blessings for obedience ( <a ref='Leviticus 26:3–13'>26:3–13</a> ) and curses for disobedience ( <a ref='Leviticus 26:14–39'>26:14–39</a> ) are elaborated (cf. <a ref='De 28'>Dt 28</a> ). A provision for repentance is also offered ( <a ref='Leviticus 26:40–45'>26:40–45</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 26:1–2'>26:1–2</a> A representative summary of the Ten Commandments ( <a ref='Exodus 20:3–17'>Ex 20:3–17</a> ) was set forth as the standard by which Israel’s obedience or disobedience would be measured. <a ref='Leviticus 26:1'>26:1</a> <b>image … pillar … carved stone.</b> Israel’s neighbors used all of these devices for the worship of their gods. <a ref='Leviticus 26:3–13'>26:3–13</a> These blessings will reward obedience. <a ref='Leviticus 26:4'>26:4</a> <b>rains in their season.</b> If the rains did not come at the right times, the people experienced crop failure and famine (cf. <a ref='1Ki 17-18'>1Ki 17–18</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 26:6'>26:6</a> <b>wild beasts.</b> Dangerous animals such as lions and bears existed in that area. Joseph’s brothers claimed that such an animal had killed him ( <a ref='Genesis 37:20'>Ge 37:20</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 26:7'>26:7</a> <b>pursue your enemies.</b> God provided victories repeatedly in the conquest of Canaan (cf. <a ref='Jos 8-12'>Jos 8–12</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 26:9'>26:9</a> <b>make you fruitful and multiply you … confirm My covenant with you.</b> What God commanded at Creation and repeated after the Flood was contained in the covenant promise of seed ( <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> ), which He will fulfill to the nation of Israel as promised to Abraham ( <a ref='Genesis 15:5–6'>Ge 15:5–6</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 26:12'>26:12</a> <b>your God … My people.</b> The promise of an intimate covenant relationship with the God of the universe is given (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:16'>2Co 6:16</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 26:14–39'>26:14–39</a> These punishments will repay disobedience. <a ref='Leviticus 26:15'>26:15</a> <b>break My covenant.</b> By disobeying the commandments and the various laws of the Mosaic Covenant, Israel broke this conditional covenant. Unlike the ultimate provisions of the unconditional covenant made with Abraham, all blessings in the covenant of Mosaic law were conditioned upon obedience (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 26:25'>Lv 26:25</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 26:16'>26:16</a> <b>consumption.</b> Perhaps tuberculosis or leprosy is in view (the subject of much legislation in <a ref='Le 13-14'>Lv 13–14</a> ), but no certain identification is possible. <b>your enemies will eat it.</b> They will be conquered by their enemies at a time when those enemies will enjoy Israel’s harvest. <a ref='Leviticus 26:22'>26:22</a> <b>roads lie desolate.</b> The activity on a nation’s roadway, i.e., messengers, merchants, and people traveling, reflected the well-being of that country. This is a picture of extreme economic siege. <a ref='Leviticus 26:25'>26:25</a> <b>vengeance for the covenant.</b> God’s retribution for Israel’s breaking the conditional Mosaic Covenant is pledged. <a ref='Leviticus 26:29'>26:29</a> <b>eat the flesh.</b> There will be widespread famine in the land and thus the people will even resort to cannibalism, which actually came to pass (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 6:28–29'>2Ki 6:28–29</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 19:9'>Jer 19:9</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 2:20'>Lam 2:20</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 4:10'>4:10</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 26:30'>26:30</a> <b>high places.</b> These were natural shrines for the worship of idols. Solomon disobeyed God by worshiping Him on the high places ( <a ref='1 Kings 3:4'>1Ki 3:4</a> ), and not long afterward, he was serving the gods of his foreign wives ( <a ref='1 Kings 11:1–9'>1Ki 11:1–9</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 26:31–35'>26:31–35</a> All this occurred in the terrible invasion of the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 BC by the Assyrians and the destruction of the southern kingdom of Judah in 605–586 BC by the Babylonians. In the case of Judah, it was a 70-year captivity to rest the land for all the Sabbath years that had been violated. See <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:17–21'>2Chr 36:17–21</a> . <a ref='Leviticus 26:35'>26:35</a> <b>rest which it did not observe.</b> By implication, because they had violated the Sabbath repeatedly. This violation became the basis of the later 70-year Babylonian captivity (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:20–21'>2Chr 36:20–21</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 26:38'>26:38</a> The 10 tribes of the northern kingdom of Israel never returned directly from captivity. See <a ref='2 Kings 17:7–23'>2Ki 17:7–23</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 26:7'>Ac 26:7</a></i> . <a ref='Leviticus 26:40–42'>26:40–42</a> <b>If they confess. … will remember My covenant.</b> God’s covenant was rooted in the relationship He had initiated with His people. True repentance would be honored by Him. <a ref='Leviticus 26:42'>26:42</a> <b>Jacob … Isaac … Abraham.</b> The reverse order is a look in retrospect as opposed to the actual historical sequence. <a ref='Leviticus 26:46'>26:46</a> Much of the content of Leviticus came during Moses’ two “forty day and night” visits to Sinai (cf. <a ref='Exodus 24:16–32:6'>Ex 24:16—32:6</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 34:2–28'>34:2–28</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 7:37–38'>Lv 7:37–38</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 25:1'>25:1</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 27:34'>27:34</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 27:1–34'>27:1–34</a> Standard legislation is given for dedicated persons, animals, houses, and lands. <a ref='Leviticus 27:2–7'>27:2–7</a> <b>makes a … vow.</b> This sets the gift apart from the rest of his household and possessions as a gift to Yahweh and His service. <a ref='Leviticus 27:3'>27:3</a> <b>the shekel of the sanctuary.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Leviticus 5:15'>5:15</a> .</i> <a ref='Leviticus 27:26'>27:26</a> <b>a firstborn.</b> The firstborn already belonged to Yahweh ( <a ref='Exodus 13:2'>Ex 13:2</a> ), so the worshiper could not dedicate it a second time. <a ref='Leviticus 27:29'>27:29</a> <b>No one … devoted.</b> A person under the ban, like Achan in <a ref='Jos 7'>Jos 7</a> . <a ref='Leviticus 27:30–32'>27:30–32</a> <b>tithe.</b> This general tithe was given to the Levites. Cf. <a ref='Numbers 18:21–32'>Nu 18:21–32</a> . This is the only mention of tithe or 10 percent in Leviticus. However, along with this offering, there were two other OT tithes which totaled about 23 percent annually (cf. the second tithe— <a ref='Deuteronomy 14:22'>Dt 14:22</a> ; and the third tithe every 3 years— <a ref='Deuteronomy 14:28–29'>Dt 14:28–29</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:12'>26:12</a> ).",
