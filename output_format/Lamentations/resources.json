    "content": "The Lamentations of Jeremiah Title “Lamentations” was derived from a translation of the title as found in the Latin Vulgate (Vg.) translation of the Greek OT, the Septuagint (LXX), and conveys the idea of “loud cries.” The Hebrew exclamation <i>‘ekah</i> (“How,” which expresses “dismay”), used in <a ref='Lamentations 1:1'>1:1</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 2:1'>2:1</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 4:1'>4:1</a> , gives the book its Hebrew title. However, the rabbis began early to call the book “loud cries” or “lamentations” (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 7:29'>Jer 7:29</a> ). No other entire OT book contains only laments, as does this distressful dirge, marking the funeral of the once beautiful city of Jerusalem (cf. <a ref='Lamentations 2:15'>2:15</a> ). This book keeps alive the memory of that fall and teaches all believers how to deal with suffering. Author and Date The author of Lamentations is not named within the book, but there are internal and historical indications that it was Jeremiah. The LXX introduces <a ref='Lamentations 1:1'>Lam 1:1</a> , “And it came to pass, after Israel had been carried away captive … Jeremiah sat weeping [cf. <a ref='Lamentations 3:48–49'>3:48–49</a> , etc.] … lamented … and said.…” God had told Jeremiah to have Judah lament ( <a ref='Jeremiah 7:29'>Jer 7:29</a> ), and Jeremiah also wrote laments for Josiah ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:25'>2Chr 35:25</a> ). Jeremiah wrote Lamentations as an eyewitness (cf. <a ref='Lamentations 1:13–15'>1:13–15</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 2:6'>2:6</a> , <a ref='Lamentations 2:9'>9</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 4:1–12'>4:1–12</a> ), possibly with Baruch’s secretarial help (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:4'>Jer 36:4</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 45:1'>45:1</a> ), during or soon after Jerusalem’s fall in 586 BC. It was mid-July when the city fell and mid-August when the temple was burned. Likely, Jeremiah saw the destruction of walls, towers, homes, palace, and temple; he wrote while the event remained painfully fresh in his memory, but before his forced departure to Egypt ca. 583 BC (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 43:1–7'>Jer 43:1–7</a> ). The language used in Lamentations closely parallels that used by Jeremiah in his much larger prophetic book (cf. <a ref='Lamentations 1:2'>1:2</a> with <a ref='Jeremiah 30:14'>Jer 30:14</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 1:15'>1:15</a> with <a ref='Jeremiah 8:21'>Jer 8:21</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 1:6'>1:6</a> and <a ref='Lamentations 2:11'>2:11</a> with <a ref='Jeremiah 9:1'>Jer 9:1</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 9:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 2:22'>2:22</a> with <a ref='Jeremiah 6:25'>Jer 6:25</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 4:21'>4:21</a> with <a ref='Jeremiah 49:12'>Jer 49:12</a> ). Background and Setting The prophetic seeds of Jerusalem’s destruction were sown through Joshua 800 years in advance ( <a ref='Joshua 23:15–16'>Jos 23:15–16</a> ). Now, for over 40 years, Jeremiah had prophesied of coming judgment and been scorned by the people for preaching doom (ca. 645–605 BC). When that judgment came on the disbelieving people from Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian army, Jeremiah still responded with great sorrow and compassion toward his suffering and obstinate people. Lamentations relates closely to the book of Jeremiah, describing the anguish over Jerusalem’s receiving God’s judgment for unrepentant sins. In the book that bears his name, Jeremiah had predicted the calamity in chaps. <a ref='Je 1-29'>1–29</a> . In Lamentations, he concentrates in more detail on the bitter suffering and heartbreak that was felt over Jerusalem’s devastation (cf. <a ref='Psalms 46:4–5'>Ps 46:4–5</a> ). So critical was Jerusalem’s destruction that the facts are recorded in 4 separate OT chapters: <a ref='2Ki 25'>2Ki 25</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 39:1–11'>Jer 39:1–11</a> ; <a ref='Je 52'>52</a> ; and <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:11–21'>2Chr 36:11–21</a> . All 154 verses have been recognized by the Jews as a part of their sacred canon. Along with Ruth, Esther, Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes, Lamentations is included among the OT books of the Megilloth, or “five scrolls,” which were read in the synagogue on special occasions. Lamentations is read on the 9th of Ab (July/Aug.) to remember the date of Jerusalem’s destruction by Nebuchadnezzar. Interestingly, this same date later marked the destruction of Herod’s temple by the Romans in AD 70. Historical and Theological Themes The chief focus of Lamentations is on God’s judgment in response to Judah’s sin. This theme can be traced throughout the book ( <a ref='Lamentations 1:5'>1:5</a> , <a ref='Lamentations 1:8'>8</a> , <a ref='Lamentations 1:18'>18</a> , <a ref='Lamentations 1:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 3:42'>3:42</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 4:6'>4:6</a> , <a ref='Lamentations 4:13'>13</a> , <a ref='Lamentations 4:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 5:16'>5:16</a> ). A second theme which surfaces is the hope found in God’s compassion (as in <a ref='Lamentations 3:22–24'>3:22–24</a> , <a ref='Lamentations 3:31–33'>31–33</a> ; cf. <a ref='Psalms 30:3–5'>Ps 30:3–5</a> ). Though the book deals with disgrace, it turns to God’s great faithfulness ( <a ref='Lamentations 3:22–25'>3:22–25</a> ) and closes with grace as Jeremiah moves from lamentation to consolation ( <a ref='Lamentations 5:19–22'>5:19–22</a> ). God’s sovereign judgment represents a third current in the book. His holiness was so offended by Judah’s sin that He ultimately brought the destructive calamity. Babylon was chosen to be His human instrument of wrath ( <a ref='Lamentations 1:5'>1:5</a> , <a ref='Lamentations 1:12'>12</a> , <a ref='Lamentations 1:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 2:1'>2:1</a> , <a ref='Lamentations 2:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 3:37–38'>3:37–38</a> ; cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:23'>Jer 50:23</a> ). Jeremiah mentions Babylon more than 150 times from <a ref='Jeremiah 20:4'>Jer 20:4</a> to <a ref='Jeremiah 52:34'>52:34</a> , but in Lamentations he never once explicitly names Babylon or its king, Nebuchadnezzar. Only the Lord is identified as the One who dealt with Judah’s sin. Fourth, because the sweeping judgment seemed to be the end of every hope of Israel’s salvation and the fulfillment of God’s promises (cf. <a ref='Lamentations 3:18'>3:18</a> ), much of the book appears in the mode of prayer: 1) <a ref='Lamentations 1:11'>1:11</a> , which represents a wailing confession of sin (cf. v. <a ref='Lamentations 1:18'>18</a> ); 2) <a ref='Lamentations 3:8'>3:8</a> , with its anguish when God “shuts out my prayer” (cf. <a ref='Lamentations 3:43–54'>3:43–54</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 7:16'>Jer 7:16</a> ); 3) <a ref='Lamentations 3:55–59'>3:55–59</a> , where Jeremiah cries to God for relief, or <a ref='Lamentations 3:60–66'>3:60–66</a> , where he seeks for recompense to the enemies (which <a ref='Je 50-51'>Jer 50–51</a> guarantees); and 4) <a ref='Lamentations 5:1–22'>5:1–22</a> , with its appeal to heaven for restored mercy (which <a ref='Je 30-33'>Jer 30–33</a> assures), based on the confidence that God is faithful ( <a ref='Lamentations 3:23'>3:23</a> ). A fifth feature relates to Christ. Jeremiah’s tears ( <a ref='Lamentations 3:48–49'>3:48–49</a> ) compare with Jesus’ weeping over the same city of Jerusalem ( <a ref='Matthew 23:37–39'>Mt 23:37–39</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:41–44'>Lk 19:41–44</a> ). Though God was the judge and executioner, it was a grief to Him to bring this destruction. The statement “In all their distress He [God] was distressed” ( <a ref='Isaiah 63:9'>Is 63:9</a> ) was true in principle. God will one day wipe away all tears ( <a ref='Isaiah 25:8'>Is 25:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 7:17'>Rev 7:17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 21:4'>21:4</a> ) when sin shall be no more. A sixth theme is an implied warning to all who read this book. If God did not hesitate to judge His beloved people ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:10'>Dt 32:10</a> ), what will He do to the nations of the world who reject His Word? Interpretive Challenges Certain details pose initial difficulties. Among them are: 1) imprecatory prayers for judgment on other sinners ( <a ref='Lamentations 1:21–22'>1:21–22</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 3:64–66'>3:64–66</a> ); 2) the reason for God shutting out prayer ( <a ref='Lamentations 3:8'>3:8</a> ); and 3) the necessity of judgment that is so severe (cf. <a ref='Lamentations 1:1'>1:1</a> , <a ref='Lamentations 1:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 3:8'>3:8</a> ). Outline In the first 4 chapters, each verse begins in an acrostic pattern, i.e., using the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet in sequence. Chapters <a ref='La 1-2'>1–2</a> , and <a ref='La 4'>4</a> have 22 verses corresponding to 22 letters, while chap. <a ref='La 3'>3</a> employs each letter for 3 consecutive verses until there are 22 trios, or 66 verses. Chapter <a ref='La 5'>5</a> is not written alphabetically, although it simulates the pattern in that it has 22 verses. An acrostic order, such as in <a ref='Ps 119'>Ps 119</a> (where all 22 Hebrew letters are used in series of 8 verses each), was used to aid memorization. The structure of the book ascends and descends from the great confession in <a ref='Lamentations 3:22–24'>3:22–24</a> , “Great is Your faithfulness,” which is the literary center of the book. I.

The multitude of sins (vv. <a ref='Lamentations 1:5'>5</a> , <a ref='Lamentations 1:8'>8</a> ) had brought this judgment from the righteous God (v. <a ref='Lamentations 1:18'>18</a> ). <a ref='Lamentations 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>like a widow.</b> Verses <a ref='Lamentations 1:1–11'>1–11</a> vividly portray the city like a bereft and desolate woman, as often in other Scriptures (cf. <a ref='Eze 16'>Eze 16</a> , <a ref='Eze 23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:10'>Mic 4:10</a> , <a ref='Micah 4:13'>13</a> ). <b>a forced laborer!</b> Judah was taken captive to serve as slaves in Babylon. <a ref='Lamentations 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>She has none to comfort her.</b> This ominous theme is mentioned 4 other times (vv. <a ref='Lamentations 1:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Lamentations 1:16–17'>16–17</a> , <a ref='Lamentations 1:21'>21</a> ). <b>lovers … friends … have become her enemies.</b> This refers to the heathen nations allied to Judah, and their idols whom Judah “loved” ( <a ref='Jeremiah 2:20–25'>Jer 2:20–25</a> ). Some later joined as enemies against her ( <a ref='2 Kings 24:2'>2Ki 24:2</a> , <a ref='2 Kings 24:7'>7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 137:7'>Ps 137:7</a> ). <a ref='Lamentations 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>exile.</b> Ca. 586 BC as in <a ref='Je 39-40'>Jer 39–40</a> , <a ref='Je 52'>52</a> . There had been two deportations earlier, in 605 BC and 597 BC (cf. Introduction: Author and Date ). <a ref='Lamentations 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>Zion.</b> This represents the place where Jehovah dwells, the mount on which the temple was built. <b>appointed times.</b> Passover, Pentecost (Feast of Weeks), and Booths, or Tabernacles (cf. <a ref='Ex 23'>Ex 23</a> ; <a ref='Le 23'>Lv 23</a> ). <b>priests are sighing.</b> These were among those left in Judah before fleeing to Egypt ( <a ref='Je 43'>Jer 43</a> ), or possibly exiles in Babylon who mourned from afar (cf. v. <a ref='Lamentations 1:3'>3</a> ). <a ref='Lamentations 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>the greatness of her transgressions.</b> This was the cause of the judgment (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 40:3'>Jer 40:3</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:7'>Da 9:7</a> , <a ref='Daniel 9:16'>16</a> ). <a ref='Lamentations 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>become an impure thing.</b> This could refer to either the vile, wretched estate of continued sin and its ruinous consequences through judgment, or to being “moved, removed,” as the LXX and Vg. translate it. Probably the former is correct, as befits the third and fourth lines, i.e., a despised, shameful, naked condition in contrast to her former splendor (cf. v. <a ref='Lamentations 1:6'>6b</a> ). <a ref='Lamentations 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>Her uncleanness was in her skirts.</b> A graphic description of the flow of spiritual uncleanness reaching the bottom of her dress (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 15:19–33'>Lv 15:19–33</a> ). <a ref='Lamentations 1:10'>1:10</a> <b>enter her sanctuary.</b> This was true of the Ammonites and Moabites ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:3'>Dt 23:3</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 13:1–2'>Ne 13:1–2</a> ). If the heathen were not allowed to enter for worship, much less were they tolerated to loot and destroy. On a future day, the nations will come to worship ( <a ref='Zechariah 14:16'>Zec 14:16</a> ). <a ref='Lamentations 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>See, O Yahweh.</b> The description of the devastated widow ends with a plea for God’s mercy. <a ref='Lamentations 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>all you who pass this way?</b> Here was the pathetic appeal of Jerusalem for some compassion even from strangers! <a ref='Lamentations 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>fire into my bones.</b> This emphasizes the penetrating depth of the judgment. <b>turned me back.</b> God’s purpose was to bring repentance. <a ref='Lamentations 1:14'>1:14</a> <b>yoke of my transgressions … By His hand.</b> Once the farmer had put the yoke on the animal’s neck, he would control it with the reins in his hands. So God, who has brought Jerusalem under yoke-bondage to Babylon, still controlled His people. <a ref='Lamentations 1:15'>1:15</a> <b>an appointed time against me.</b> Not the usual assembly for a solemn feast; rather the army of Babylon for destruction. in <b>a wine press.</b> Speaks of forcing blood to burst forth like juice from crushed grapes. Comparable language is used in <a ref='Revelation 14:20'>Rev 14:20</a> and <a ref='Revelation 19:15'>19:15</a> in regard to God’s final wrath. <a ref='Lamentations 1:17'>1:17</a> <b>impure.</b> This refers to a menstruous woman, shamed, separated from her husband and the temple (cf. vv. <a ref='Lamentations 1:8–9'>8–9</a> and <a ref='Leviticus 15:19'>Lv 15:19ff.</a> ). <a ref='Lamentations 1:18'>1:18</a> <b>Yahweh is righteous. … have rebelled.</b> The true sign of repentance was to justify God and condemn oneself. <a ref='Lamentations 1:21–22'>1:21–22</a> <b>brought the day.</b> A prayer that God will likewise bring other ungodly people into judgment, especially Babylon ( <a ref='Lamentations 3:64–66'>3:64–66</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 4:21–22'>4:21–22</a> ). Such prayers are acceptable against the enemies of God (cf. <a ref='Psalms 109:14–15'>Ps 109:14–15</a> ). <a ref='Lamentations 1:22'>1:22</a> <b>come before You.</b> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 16:19'>Rev 16:19</a> . <a ref='Lamentations 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>How Yahweh has.</b> Much in <a ref='La 2'>Lam 2</a> depicts God’s judgment in vivid portrayals. He covered the Judeans with a cloud (v. <a ref='Lamentations 2:1'>1</a> ), withdrew His hand of protection (v. <a ref='Lamentations 2:3'>3</a> ), bent His bow and had slain with His arrows (v. <a ref='Lamentations 2:4'>4</a> ), and stretched out a surveyor’s line to mark walls to be destroyed (v. <a ref='Lamentations 2:8'>8</a> ). He will work a rebuilding of Jerusalem in the future kingdom ( <a ref='Zechariah 2:1–13'>Zec 2:1–13</a> ). <b>The beauty of Israel.</b> Likely refers to Mt. Zion and the temple (cf. <a ref='Psalms 48:2'>Pss 48:2</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 50:2'>50:2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:13'>Is 60:13</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 64:11'>64:11</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 16:14'>Eze 16:14</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 11:45'>Da 11:45</a> ). <b>the footstool of His feet.</b> Refers to the ark of the covenant as indicated by <a ref='1 Chronicles 28:2'>1Chr 28:2</a> and <a ref='Psalms 99:5'>Pss 99:5</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 132:7'>132:7</a> . <a ref='Lamentations 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>He has pulled down.</b> Yahweh had cast down the bastions of Judah’s defense, as He told Jeremiah He would do from the outset of his ministry ( <a ref='Jeremiah 1:10'>Jer 1:10</a> ). <a ref='Lamentations 2:6–11'>2:6–11</a> Tragedy comes to everything and everyone through sin. The account mentions the temple or tabernacle where Israelites came to worship (v. <a ref='Lamentations 2:6'>6</a> ), feasts and Sabbaths (v. <a ref='Lamentations 2:6'>6</a> ), leaders such as the king and priests (v. <a ref='Lamentations 2:6'>6</a> ), His altar and holy places (v. <a ref='Lamentations 2:7'>7</a> ), city walls (v. <a ref='Lamentations 2:8'>8</a> ), the law (v. <a ref='Lamentations 2:9'>9</a> ), and children in the family (v. <a ref='Lamentations 2:11'>11</a> ). <a ref='Lamentations 2:6–7'>2:6–7</a> Cf. <a ref='Lamentations 1:4'>1:4</a> . <a ref='Lamentations 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>noise … house of Yahweh … day of an appointed time.</b> A shout of triumph in the captured temple resembled the joyous celebrations in the same place at the solemn feasts. <a ref='Lamentations 2:11–12'>2:11–12</a> This description of Babylon’s invasion depicted the reality of a hungry child dying in its mother’s arms as a result. <a ref='Lamentations 2:14'>2:14</a> <b>Worthless and ineffective</b> visions <b>.</b> As <a ref='Jeremiah 23:16–17'>Jer 23:16–17</a> indicates, these lies spoke of peace and comfort, not judgment. Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 23:30–40'>Jer 23:30–40</a> to see how such lying led to destruction. <a ref='Lamentations 2:17'>2:17</a> <b>He has completed His word.</b> The enemy that gloats in vv. <a ref='Lamentations 2:15–16'>15–16</a> should recognize that the destruction was the work of a sovereign God. This verse is the focal point of the chapter (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:12'>Jer 51:12</a> ). <a ref='Lamentations 2:18'>2:18</a> <b>wall of the daughter of Zion.</b> The penetrated walls of Jerusalem cried out in anguish that they had been broached by the Babylonians. <a ref='Lamentations 2:20'>2:20</a> <b>See, O Yahweh, and look!</b> The chapter closes by placing the issue before God. <b>women eat their offspring.</b> Hunger became so desperate in the 18-month siege that women resorted to the unbelievable—even eating their children (cf. <a ref='Lamentations 4:10'>4:10</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 26:29'>Lv 26:29</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:53'>Dt 28:53</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:56–57'>56–57</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 19:9'>Jer 19:9</a> ). <a ref='Lamentations 2:21'>2:21</a> <b>the day of Your anger.</b> This describes the complete slaughter, as does <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:17'>2Chr 36:17</a> . <a ref='Lamentations 3:1–20'>3:1–20</a> <b>the man who has seen affliction.</b> Jeremiah’s distress in such tragedy comes from God, referred to as “He” throughout this section. Even the righteous experience “the rod of His wrath.” <a ref='Lamentations 3:8'>3:8</a> <b>He shuts out my prayer.</b> Cf. v. <a ref='Lamentations 3:44'>44</a> . God’s nonresponse to Jeremiah’s prayers was not because Jeremiah was guilty of personal sin (cf. <a ref='Psalms 66:18'>Ps 66:18</a> ); rather, it was due to Israel’s perpetual sin without repentance ( <a ref='Jeremiah 19:15'>Jer 19:15</a> ). God’s righteousness to judge that sin must pursue its course ( <a ref='Jeremiah 7:16'>Jer 7:16</a> , and <i>see note there</i> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 11:14'>11:14</a> ).
