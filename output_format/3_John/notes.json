The term “beloved” is only used of Christians in the NT ( Col 3:12 ; Phm 1–2 ; 2Pe 3:14 ; 1Jn 4:1 ). Gaius. Nothing is known of Gaius beyond the mention of his name in the salutation. The name was one of 18 common names from which Roman parents usually chose a name for one of their sons, making any specific identification doubtful. John, his fellow believers, and even strangers to whom Gaius extended hospitality held him in great esteem for his Christian walk and conduct (vv. 1–6 ). John conveyed his own appreciation for Gaius by calling him “beloved” 4 times in the letter (vv. 1–2 , 5 , 11 ). He probably was a member of a church somewhere in Asia Minor that was under John’s sphere of influence. The apostle planned to visit him sometime in the near future (v. 13 ). whom I love in truth. Because Christians have common knowledge of the truth, they have the common source of love ( 2Jn 1 ). While some have taken the phrase to mean simply “truly” ( Mk 12:32 ), John’s usage of this phrase elsewhere in these letters where truth takes on such a significant meaning suggests that the elder intended the kind of love that is consistent with the fundamental truths of the faith (cf. v. 4 ; 1Jn 2:21 ; 3:19 )."

John’s commendation of him is one of the greatest given in the NT, since the commendation centers not only in the fact that he knew the truth but that he faithfully practiced it. Gaius’ actions were in stark contrast to Diotrephes’ negative reputation (v. 10 )."

    "content": "<b><a>7–8</a></b> John gives several grounds for practicing hospitality in a “manner worthy of God” (v. 6 ). First, one must show hospitality to those who have pure motives. These itinerant missionaries went out “for the sake of the Name” (v. 7 ; cf. Ro 1:5 ). They must be doing their ministry for God’s glory, not their own. Second, one must show hospitality to those who are not in ministry for money. Since the missionaries were “receiving nothing from the Gentiles” (v. 7 ), the church was their only means of support. They were free from avarice ( 2Co 2:17 ; 1Ti 5:17–18 ). Third, those who show hospitality participate in the ministries of those to whom hospitality is shown (v. 8 ). Verse 8 gives the same reason to demonstrate hospitality to genuine teachers as does 2Jn 10 in forbidding hospitality toward false teachers, i.e., that those who extend hospitality share in the deeds (i.e., good or bad) of those receiving it."

Perhaps Diotrephes never read it to the church because he rejected John’s authority (cf. vv. 9–10 ). Diotrephes, who loves to be first. In the second part of his epistle, John condemned the violation of hospitality toward faithful ministers of the Word. The word “first” conveys the idea of someone who is selfish, self-centered, and self-seeking. The language suggests a self-promoting demagogue, who served no one, but wanted all to serve only him. Diotrephes’ actions directly contradict Jesus’ and the NT’s teaching on servant-leadership in the church (cf. Mt 20:20–28 ; Php 2:5–11 ; 1Ti 3:3 ; 1Pe 5:3 ). does not welcome what we say. Diotrephes modeled the opposite of kindness and hospitality to God’s servants, even denying John’s apostolic authority over the local congregation, and as a result, denying the revelation of God that came through that authority. His pride endeavored to supplant the rule of Christ through John in the church. Diotrephes’ character was the very opposite of the gentle and loving Gaius who readily showed hospitality."

John’s apostolic authority meant that Diotrephes had to answer for his behavior. The apostle did not overlook this usurping of Christ’s place in the church. Verse 10 indicates that Diotrephes was guilty of 4 things: 1) “unjustly disparaging us.” The charges against John were completely unjustified; 2) “with wicked words.” Not only were Diotrephes’ charges false, they were evil; 3) “does not welcome the brothers.” He not only slandered John but also deliberately defied other believers; and 4) “puts them out of the church.” The original language indicates that Diotrephes’ habit was to excommunicate those who resisted his authority. does not welcome the brothers. To accept John’s authority (v. 9 ), as well as being hospitable to the traveling ministers, directly threatened the authority that Diotrephes coveted."
