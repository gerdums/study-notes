    "content": "The Book of Ezra Title Even though Ezra’s name does not enter the account of Judah’s post-Exilic return to Jerusalem until <a ref='Ezra 7:1'>7:1</a> , the book bears his name (“Jehovah helps”) as a title. This is because both Jewish and Christian tradition attribute authorship to this famous scribe-priest. New Testament writers do not quote the book of Ezra. Author and Date Ezra is most likely the author of both Ezra and Nehemiah, which might have originally been one book. <a ref='Ezra 4:8–6:18'>Ezra 4:8—6:18</a> and <a ref='Ezra 7:12–26'>7:12–26</a> are written in Aramaic. Although Ezra never states his authorship, internal arguments favor him strongly. After his arrival in Jerusalem (ca. 458 BC), he changed from writing in the third person to writing in the first person. In the earlier section it is likely that he had used the third person because he was quoting his memoirs. Ezra is believed to possibly be the author of the books of the Chronicles. It would have been natural for the same author to continue the OT narrative by showing how God fulfilled His promise by returning His people to the land after 70 years of captivity. There is also a strong priestly tone in Chronicles, and Ezra was a priestly descendant of Aaron (cf. <a ref='Ezra 7:1–5'>7:1–5</a> ). The concluding verses of 2 Chronicles ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:22–23'>36:22–23</a> ) are virtually identical to the beginning verses of Ezra ( <a ref='Ezra 1:1–3'>1:1–3a</a> ), affirming his authorship of both. Ezra was a scribe who had access to the myriad of administrative documents found in Ezra and Nehemiah, especially those in the book of Ezra. Very few people would have been allowed access to the royal archives of the Persian Empire, but Ezra proved to be the exception (cf. <a ref='Ezra 1:2–4'>Ezr 1:2–4</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 4:9–22'>4:9–22</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 5:7–17'>5:7–17</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 6:3–12'>6:3–12</a> ). His role as a scribe of the law is spelled out in <a ref='Ezra 7:10'>7:10</a> : “For Ezra had set his heart to study the law of Yahweh, and to practice <i>it</i> , and to teach <i>His</i> statute and judgment in Israel.” He was a strong and godly man who lived at the time of Nehemiah (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 8:1–9'>Ne 8:1–9</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 12:36'>12:36</a> ). Tradition says he was founder of the Great Synagogue, where the complete OT canon was first formally recognized. Ezra led the second return from Persia (ca. 458 BC), so the completed book was written sometime in the next several decades (ca. 457–444 BC). Background and Setting God had originally brought Israel out of the slave markets of Egypt in the Exodus (ca. 1445 BC). Hundreds of years later, before the events of Ezra, God told His people that if they chose to break their covenant with Him, He would again allow other nations to take them into slavery ( <a ref='Jeremiah 2:14–25'>Jer 2:14–25</a> ). In spite of God’s repeated warnings from the mouths of His prophets, Israel and Judah chose to reject their Lord and to participate in the worship of foreign gods, in addition to committing the abominable practices which accompanied idolatry (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 17:7–18'>2Ki 17:7–18</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 2:7–13'>Jer 2:7–13</a> ). True to His promise, God brought the Assyrians and Babylonians to issue His chastisement upon wayward Israel and Judah. In 722 BC the Assyrians deported the 10 northern tribes and scattered them all over their empire (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 17:24–41'>2Ki 17:24–41</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 7:8'>Is 7:8</a> ). Several centuries later, in 605–586 BC, God used the Babylonians to sack and nearly depopulate Jerusalem. Because Judah persisted in her unfaithfulness to the covenant, God chastened His people with 70 years of captivity ( <a ref='Jeremiah 25:11'>Jer 25:11</a> ), from which they returned to Jerusalem as reported by Ezra and Nehemiah. Cyrus, the Persian, overthrew Babylon in 539 BC, and the book of Ezra begins with the decree of Cyrus one year later for the Jews to return to Jerusalem (ca. 538 BC), and it chronicles the reestablishment of Judah’s national calendar of feasts and sacrifices, including the rebuilding of the second temple (begun in 536 BC and completed in 516 BC). As there had been 3 waves of deportation from Israel into Babylon (605 BC, 597 BC, and 586 BC), so there were actually 3 returns to Jerusalem over a 9-decade span. Zerubbabel first returned in 538 BC. He was followed by Ezra, who led the second return in 458 BC. Nehemiah did likewise 13 years later, in 445 BC. Complete uncontested political autonomy, however, never returned. The prophets Haggai and Zechariah preached during Zerubbabel’s time, about 520 BC and following. Historical and Theological Themes The Jews’ return from the Babylonian captivity seemed like a second Exodus, sovereignly patterned in some ways after Israel’s first redemption from Egyptian bondage. The return trip from Babylon involved activities similar to those of the original Exodus: 1) the rebuilding of the temple and the city walls; 2) the reinstitution of the law, which made Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah collectively seem like a second Moses; 3) the challenge of the local enemies; and 4) the temptation to intermarry with non-Jews, resulting in idolatry. Other parallels between the original Exodus and the return from Babylon must have seemed to the returnees as though they had been given a fresh start by God. In his account of the return, Ezra drew upon a collection of Persian administrative documents to which he had access as a scribe. The presence of actual royal administrative documents carries a powerful message when accompanied by the resounding line “the hand of Yahweh his/my God <i>was</i> upon him/me” ( <a ref='Ezra 7:6'>7:6</a> , <a ref='Ezra 7:28'>28</a> ). The decrees, proclamations, letters, lists, genealogies, and memoranda, many of them written by the Persian administration, attest to the sovereign hand of God in Israel’s restoration. The primary message of the book is that God orchestrated the past grim situation (captivity) and would continue to work through a pagan king and his successors to give Judah hope for the future (return). God’s administration overrides that of any of the kings of this world, and thus the book of Ezra is a message of God’s continuing covenant grace to Israel. Another prominent theme which surfaces in Ezra is opposition from the local Samaritan residents whose ancestors had been imported from Assyria ( <a ref='Ezra 4:2'>4:2</a> ; cf. <a ref='John 4:4–42'>Jn 4:4–42</a> ). For reasons of spiritual sabotage, Israel’s enemies requested to participate in rebuilding the temple ( <a ref='Ezra 4:1–2'>4:1–2</a> ). After being shunned, the enemies hired counselors against the Jews (cf. <a ref='Ezra 4:4–5'>4:4–5</a> ). But the Lord, through the preaching of Haggai and Zechariah, rekindled the spirit of the people and their leaders to build, with the words “… be strong … and work; for I am with you” ( <a ref='Haggai 2:4'>Hag 2:4</a> ; cf. <a ref='Ezra 4:24–5:2'>Ezr 4:24—5:2</a> ). The reconstruction resumed (ca. 520 BC) and the temple was soon finished, dedicated, and back in service to God (ca. 516 BC). Interpretive Challenges First, how do the post-Exilic historical books of 1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther relate to the post-Exilic prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi? For the chronology of Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther, <i>see the notes on <a ref='Ezra 6:22–7:1'>Ezr 6:22—7:1</a></i> . The two books of Chronicles were written by Ezra as a reminder of the promised Davidic kingship, the Aaronic priesthood, and appropriate temple worship. Haggai and Zechariah prophesied in the period of <a ref='Ezr 4-6'>Ezr 4–6</a> when temple construction was resumed. Malachi wrote during Nehemiah’s revisit to Persia (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 13:6'>Ne 13:6</a> ). Second, what purpose does the book serve? Ezra historically reports the first two of three post-Exilic returns to Jerusalem from the Babylonian captivity. The first return (chaps. <a ref='Ezr 1-6'>1–6</a> ) was under Zerubbabel (ca. 538 BC) and the second (chaps. <a ref='Ezr 7-10'>7–10</a> ) was led by Ezra himself (ca. 458 BC). Spiritually, Ezra reestablished the importance of the Aaronic priesthood by tracing his ancestry to Eleazar, Phinehas, and Zadok (cf. <a ref='Ezra 7:1–5'>Ezr 7:1–5</a> ). He reported on the rebuilding of the second temple (chaps. <a ref='Ezr 3-6'>3–6</a> ). How he dealt with the gross sin of intermarriage with foreigners is presented in chaps. <a ref='Ezr 9-10'>9–10</a> . Most importantly, he reports how the sovereign hand of God moved kings and overcame varied opposition to reestablish Israel as Abraham’s seed, nationally and individually, in the land promised to Abraham, David, and Jeremiah. Third, the temple was built during the reign of Cyrus. Mention of Ahasuerus ( <a ref='Ezra 4:6'>4:6</a> ) and Artaxerxes ( <a ref='Ezra 4:7–23'>4:7–23</a> ) might lead one to conclude that the temple could also have been built during their reigns. Such a conclusion, however, violates history. Ezra was not writing about the construction accomplishments of Ahasuerus or Artaxerxes, but rather he continued to chronicle their oppositions after the temple was built, which continued even to Ezra’s day. It is apparent, then, that <a ref='Ezra 4:1–5'>Ezr 4:1–5</a> and <a ref='Ezra 4:24–5:2'>4:24—5:2</a> deal with rebuilding the temple under Zerubbabel, while <a ref='Ezra 4:6–23'>4:6–23</a> is a parenthesis recounting the history of opposition in the times of Ezra and Nehemiah. Fourth, the interpreter must decide where Esther fits in to the time of Ezra. A careful examination indicates it took place between the events of chaps. <a ref='Ezr 6'>6</a> and <a ref='Ezr 7'>7</a> . <i>See notes on Esther.</i> Fifth, how does divorce in <a ref='Ezr 10'>Ezr 10</a> correlate with the fact that God hates divorce ( <a ref='Malachi 2:16'>Mal 2:16</a> )? Ezra does not establish the norm, but rather deals with a special case in history. It seems to have been decided ( <a ref='Ezra 10:3'>Ezr 10:3</a> ) on the principle that the lesser wrong (divorce) would be preferable to the greater wrong of the Jewish race being polluted by intermarriage, so that the nation and the messianic line of David would not be ended by being mingled with Gentiles. To solve the problem this way magnifies the mercy of God in that the only other solution would have been to kill all of those involved (husband, wives, and children) by stoning, as was done during the first Exodus at Shittim ( <a ref='Numbers 25:1–9'>Nu 25:1–9</a> ).

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Ezra 1:1–3'>1:1–3a</a> These verses are almost identical to <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:22–23'>2Chr 36:22–23</a> . The pre-Exilic history of 1 and 2 Chronicles gave the post-Exilic returnees direction regarding the Davidic kingship, the Aaronic priesthood, and temple worship. This book continues the story. <a ref='Ezra 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>first year.</b> Ca. 538 BC. <b>Cyrus king of Persia.</b> Ca. 550–530 BC. Yahweh had prophesied through Isaiah, who said of Cyrus, <i>“He is</i> My shepherd,” and declares of Jerusalem, “She will be built,” and to the temple, “Your foundation will be laid” ( <a ref='Isaiah 44:28'>Is 44:28</a> ). The historian Josephus records an account of the day when Daniel read Isaiah’s prophecy to Cyrus, and in response he was moved to declare the proclamation of <a ref='Ezra 1:2–4'>1:2–4</a> (538 BC). <b>from the mouth of Jeremiah.</b> Jeremiah had prophesied the return of the exiles after a 70-year captivity in Babylon ( <a ref='Jeremiah 25:11'>Jer 25:11</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 29:10–14'>29:10–14</a> ; cf. <a ref='Daniel 9:2'>Da 9:2</a> ). This was no isolated event, but rather an outworking of the covenant promises made to Abraham in <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> . <b>Yahweh stirred up.</b> A strong expression of the fact that God sovereignly works in the lives of kings to effect His purposes ( <a ref='Proverbs 21:1'>Pr 21:1</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 2:21'>Da 2:21</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 4:17'>4:17</a> ). <b>had a proclamation.</b> This was the most common form of spoken, public communication, usually from the central administration. The king would dispatch a herald, perhaps with a written document, into the city. In order to address the people, he would either go to the city gate, where people often congregated for social discourse, or gather the people together in a square, occasionally by the blowing of a horn. The herald would then make the proclamation to the people. A document called the Cyrus Cylinder, recovered in reasonably good condition by archeologists, commissions people from many lands to return to their cities to rebuild the temples to their gods, apparently as some sort of general policy of Cyrus. Whether or not this document was an extension of the proclamation made to the exiles in this passage must remain a matter of speculation (cf. <a ref='Ezra 6:2–5'>6:2–5</a> ). put it <b>in writing.</b> Proclamations were oral statements, usually made by a herald, which were often written down for recordkeeping. <a ref='Ezra 1:2–4'>1:2–4</a> It is possible that Daniel played a part in the Jews’ receiving such favorable treatment (cf. <a ref='Daniel 6:25–28'>Da 6:25–28</a> ). According to the Jewish historian Josephus, he was Cyrus’ prime minister who shared Isaiah’s prophecies with Cyrus ( <a ref='Isaiah 44:28'>Is 44:28</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 46:1–4'>46:1–4</a> ). The existence of such documents, written over a century before Cyrus was born, led him to acknowledge that all his power came from the God of Israel and prompted him to fulfill the prophecy. <a ref='Ezra 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>Yahweh, the God of heaven.</b> The God of Israel was recognized as the utmost divine authority (cf. <a ref='Ezra 5:12'>5:12</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 6:9–10'>6:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 7:12'>7:12</a> , <a ref='Ezra 7:21'>21</a> , <a ref='Ezra 7:23'>23</a> ), who sovereignly dispenses authority to human monarchs. <b>a house.</b> This refers to the second temple, which would be built after the return to the land by Zerubbabel. <a ref='Ezra 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>whose spirit God had stirred.</b> The primary underlying message of Ezra and Nehemiah is that the sovereign hand of God is at work in perfect keeping with His plan at His appointed times. The 70 years of captivity were complete, so God stirred up not only the spirit of Cyrus to make the decree, but His own people to go and build up Jerusalem and the temple (cf. <a ref='Ezra 1:1'>1:1</a> ).

One can hear faint echoes of the Egyptians supplying treasures in order to provide splendor for the tabernacle (cf. <a ref='Exodus 11:2'>Ex 11:2</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 12:35–36'>12:35–36</a> ). Here other nations around Israel are called to contribute. They were assisted by some of their captive countrymen, who had been born in Babylon and chose to remain, and perhaps by some Babylonians and Assyrians who were favorably disposed to Cyrus and/or the Jews. <a ref='Ezra 1:7'>1:7</a> <b>the articles of the house of Yahweh.</b> Cf. <a ref='Ezra 6:5'>Ezr 6:5</a> . These were the vessels which Nebuchadnezzar removed when he sacked the temple (ca. 605–586 BC; <a ref='2 Kings 24:13'>2Ki 24:13</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 25:14–15'>25:14–15</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 1:2'>Da 1:2</a> ). God had preserved them ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:7'>2Chr 36:7</a> ) with the Babylonians (cf. <a ref='Daniel 5:1–4'>Da 5:1–4</a> ) for the return as prophesied by Jeremiah ( <a ref='Jeremiah 27:22'>Jer 27:22</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</b> Cf. <a ref='Ezra 1:11'>1:11</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 5:14'>5:14</a> , <a ref='Ezra 5:16'>16</a> . Nothing is said about this man biblically except in Ezra. Most likely, he was a political appointee of Cyrus to oversee Judah. He is not to be confused with Zerubbabel, who was the leader recognized by the Jews (cf. <a ref='Ezra 2:2'>2:2</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 3:2'>3:2</a> , <a ref='Ezra 3:8'>8</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 4:2–3'>4:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 5:2'>5:2</a> ) and by God (cf. <a ref='Hag 1-2'>Hag 1–2</a> ; <a ref='Zec 4'>Zec 4</a> ). While Zerubbabel did not serve as king, he was in the Davidic line of Messiah (cf. <a ref='Haggai 2:23'>Hag 2:23</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 1:12'>Mt 1:12</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 1:9–11'>1:9–11</a> The 2,499 articles counted in vv. <a ref='Ezra 1:9–10'>9–10</a> are only representative of the total of 5,400 mentioned in v. <a ref='Ezra 1:11'>11</a> . <a ref='Ezra 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>exiles.</b> Those whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into Babylonian captivity from Jerusalem, whose return probably occurred early in the reign of Cyrus (ca. 538/537 BC). <b>Babylon to Jerusalem.</b> A journey taking 3–5 months (cf. <a ref='Ezra 7:8–9'>Ezr 7:8–9</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 2:1–70'>2:1–70</a> This list is given almost identically in <a ref='Nehemiah 7:6–73'>Ne 7:6–73</a> ( <i>see notes there</i> ). <a ref='Ezra 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>the province.</b> This refers to Judah, reduced from an illustrious, independent, and powerful kingdom to an obscure, servile province of the Persian Empire. The returning Jews were still considered subjects of Cyrus living in a Persian province. <a ref='Ezra 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>Zerubbabel.</b> This man was the rightful leader of Judah in that he was of the lineage of David through Jehoiachin (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 3:17'>1Chr 3:17</a> ). He did not serve as king (cf. the curse on Jehoiachin’s line, <a ref='Jeremiah 22:24–30'>Jer 22:24–30</a> ), but was still in the messianic line because the curse was bypassed (cf. <a ref='Matthew 1:12'>Mt 1:12</a> ; <a ref='Luke 3:27'>Lk 3:27</a> ). The curse of the messianic line for Christ was bypassed in Luke’s genealogy by tracing the lineage through David’s son Nathan. His name means “offspring of Babylon,” indicating his place of birth. He, rather than Cyrus’ political appointee Sheshbazzar (cf. <a ref='Ezra 1:11'>1:11</a> ), led Judah according to God’s will. <b>Jeshua.</b> The High Priest of the first return whose name means “Jehovah saves.” He is called Joshua in <a ref='Haggai 1:1'>Hag 1:1</a> and <a ref='Zechariah 3:1'>Zec 3:1</a> . His father Jozadak ( <a ref='Ezra 3:2'>Ezr 3:2</a> ) had been exiled (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:15'>1Chr 6:15</a> ). He came from the lineage of Levi, Aaron, Eleazar, and Phinehas; thus he was legitimately in the line of the High Priest (cf. <a ref='Numbers 25:10–13'>Nu 25:10–13</a> ). <b>Nehemiah … Mordecai.</b> These are not the same men in Nehemiah or Esther. <a ref='Ezra 2:3–20'>2:3–20</a> Various Jewish families are listed. <a ref='Ezra 2:21–35'>2:21–35</a> These were people from various Judean cities. <a ref='Ezra 2:36–42'>2:36–42</a> Priests and Levites. See <a ref='Nehemiah 12:1–9'>Ne 12:1–9</a> for additional details. <a ref='Ezra 2:43–54'>2:43–54</a> <b>temple servants.</b> These were descendants of the Gibeonites who performed servile duties at the temple. <a ref='Ezra 2:55–58'>2:55–58</a> Here are descendants of Solomon’s servants. <a ref='Ezra 2:59–62'>2:59–62</a> Those whose genealogical information could not be verified. <a ref='Ezra 2:63'>2:63</a> <b>Urim and Thummim.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Exodus 28:30'>Ex 28:30</a> .</i> These objects, kept in the breastpiece of the High Priest, were used to determine God’s will. <a ref='Ezra 2:64–65'>2:64–65</a> This gross amount is 12,000 more than the particular numbers given in the catalogue, when added together. Reckoning up the smaller numbers, we will find they amount to 29,818 in this chapter, and to 31,089 in the parallel chapter of Nehemiah. Ezra also mentions 494 persons omitted by Nehemiah, and Nehemiah mentions 1,765 not noticed by Ezra. If, therefore, Ezra’s surplus is added to the sum in Nehemiah, and Nehemiah’s surplus to the number in Ezra, they will both become 31,583. Subtracting this from 42,360, there is a deficiency of 10,777. These are omitted because they did not belong to Judah and Benjamin, or to the priests, but to the other tribes. The servants and singers, male and female, are reckoned separately (v. <a ref='Ezra 2:65'>65</a> ), so that putting all these items together, the number of all who went with Zerubbabel amounted to 50,000 with 8,000 beasts of burden. <a ref='Ezra 2:69'>2:69</a> <b>drachmas … minas.</b> “Drachma” probably refers to a Persian coin, the daric, named after Darius I. This would have amounted to approximately 1,100 lbs. of gold. A mina weighed about 1.2 lbs., so this would represent 3 tons of silver (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 29:7'>1Chr 29:7</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 2:70'>2:70</a> <b>temple servants.</b> <i>See note on vv. <a ref='Ezra 2:43–54'>43–54</a> .</i> The Return from Exile Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Ezra 3:1–13'>3:1–13</a> The worship and regular calendar resumed. The altar was probably rebuilt in 537 BC. <a ref='Ezra 3:1'>3:1</a> After their arrival, they were occupied with their own dwellings in and around Jerusalem. After that work was done, they turned to building the altar of burnt offering in time for the feasts, resolved to celebrate as if the temple had been completed. The month (ca. Sept.–Oct. 537 BC) of the Feasts of Trumpets, Atonement, and Booths, or Tabernacles (cf. v. <a ref='Ezra 3:4'>4</a> ) was the seventh month. Such an assembly had not convened for 70 years. They obeyed according to <a ref='Leviticus 23:24–44'>Lv 23:24–44</a> . Over 90 years later, Nehemiah and Ezra would lead a similar celebration (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 8:13–18'>Ne 8:13–18</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 3:2'>3:2</a> <b>Jeshua … and Zerubbabel.</b> The recognized spiritual and civil leaders, respectively. <i>See notes on <a ref='Ezra 2:2'>2:2</a> .</i> <b>as it is written in the law of Moses.</b> The burnt offerings were in accord with <a ref='Leviticus 1:3–17'>Lv 1:3–17</a> . <a ref='Ezra 3:3'>3:3</a> <b>set up the altar.</b> This was all that was needed to reestablish temple worship (cf. v. <a ref='Ezra 3:6'>6</a> ).

The nation was small and weak, the temple smaller and less beautiful by far. There were no riches as in David and Solomon’s days. The ark was gone. But most disappointing was the absence of God’s Shekinah glory. Thus the weeping. <b>shouts with gladness.</b> For those who did not have a point of comparison, this was a great moment. Possibly <a ref='Ps 126'>Ps 126</a> was written and sung for this occasion. <a ref='Ezra 4:1'>4:1</a> <b>the adversaries.</b> Cf. <a ref='Ezra 5:3–17'>5:3–17</a> . These were Israel’s adversaries in the region, who resisted their reestablishment. <a ref='Ezra 4:2'>4:2</a> <b>we have been sacrificing to Him.</b> This false claim represented the syncretistic worship of the Samaritans, whose ancestry came from intermarriage with foreign immigrants in Samaria after 722 BC (cf. v. <a ref='Ezra 4:10'>10</a> ). In the British Museum is a large cylinder and inscribed on it are the annals of Esarhaddon, an Assyrian king (ca. 681–669 BC), who deported a large population of Israelites from Israel. A consequent settlement of Babylonian colonists took their place and intermarried with remaining Jewish women and their descendants. The result was the mongrel race called Samaritans. They had developed a superstitious form of worshiping God (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 17:26–34'>2Ki 17:26–34</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 4:3'>4:3</a> <b>we ourselves.</b> Idolatry had been the chief cause for Judah’s deportation to Babylon, and they wanted to avoid it altogether. While they still had their spiritual problems ( <a ref='Ezr 9-10'>Ezr 9–10</a> ), they rejected any form of mixed religion, particularly this offer of cooperation which had sabotage as its goal (cf. vv. <a ref='Ezra 4:4–5'>4–5</a> ). <b>King Cyrus … commanded us.</b> Cf. <a ref='Ezra 1:2–4'>Ezr 1:2–4</a> (ca. 538 BC).

As a result, the people took more interest in their personal affairs than spiritual matters (cf. <a ref='Haggai 1:2–6'>Hag 1:2–6</a> ). <b>Darius.</b> Darius ruled Persia ca. 521–486 BC. <a ref='Ezra 4:6–23'>4:6–23</a> This section represents later opposition which Ezra chose to put here as a parenthetical continuation of the theme “opposition to resettling and rebuilding Judah” (see Introduction: Interpretive Challenges ). He first referred to the opposition from Israel’s enemies under King Ahasuerus (a regal title) or Xerxes (ca. 486–464 BC), who ruled at the time of Esther ( <a ref='Ezra 4:6'>4:6</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 4:7–23'>Ezr 4:7–23</a> then recounts opposition in Nehemiah’s day under Artaxerxes I (ca. 464–423 BC) expressed in a detailed letter of accusation against the Jews (vv. <a ref='Ezra 4:7–16'>7–16</a> ). It was successful in stopping the work, as the king’s reply indicates (vv. <a ref='Ezra 4:17–23'>17–23</a> ). Most likely, this opposition is that also spoken of in <a ref='Nehemiah 1:3'>Ne 1:3</a> . All this was the ongoing occurrence of severe animosity between the Israelites and Samaritans, which was later aggravated when the Samaritans built a rival temple on Mt. Gerizim (cf. <a ref='John 4:9'>Jn 4:9</a> ). The opposition to Zerubbabel picks up again at <a ref='Ezra 4:24–5:2'>4:24—5:2</a> during the reign of Darius I, who actually reigned before either Ahasuerus or Artaxerxes. <a ref='Ezra 4:6'>4:6</a> <b>they wrote an accusation.</b> The word translated “accusation” means “a complaint.” Satan, meaning “legal adversary” or “opponent,” is a related term. <a ref='Ezra 4:7–8'>4:7–8</a> <b>letter … letter.</b> Two different words are used here. The first is an official document as opposed to a simple letter. The second is the generic term for letter.

Part of its message is addressed specifically to Zerubbabel, the political leader, and Joshua, the religious leader, telling them to “be strong … and work” on the temple because God was with them ( <a ref='Haggai 2:4'>Hag 2:4</a> ). These two prophets gave severe reproaches and threats if the people did not return to the building and promised national prosperity if they did. Not long after the exiles heard this message, the temple work began afresh after a 16-year hiatus. <i>See notes on Haggai and Zechariah.</i> <a ref='Ezra 5:2'>5:2</a> <b>prophets of God.</b> These would be in addition to Haggai and Zechariah. <a ref='Ezra 5:3'>5:3</a> <b>Tattenai.</b> Most likely a Persian official. <b>Who issued you a decree…?</b> In other words, “Who gave you royal permission to build?” Cf. <a ref='Ezra 5:9'>Ezr 5:9</a> . <a ref='Ezra 5:5'>5:5</a> <b>But the eye of their God was on the elders.</b> God’s hand of protection which led this endeavor allowed the work to continue while official communication was going on with Darius, the Persian king ( <i>see note on <a ref='Ezra 4:5'>4:5</a></i> ). <a ref='Ezra 5:8'>5:8</a> <b>huge stones, and timber.</b> This technique of using beams and stone blocks was a well-known form of wall construction.

The point here is that God, as King of the universe, satisfied His wrath by relinquishing the authority for this administrative action to Nebuchadnezzar. The greatest king the ancient Near East has ever known was merely a petty official in the administration of the sovereign Lord. <a ref='Ezra 5:13'>5:13</a> <b>Cyrus … decree.</b> Cf. <a ref='Ezra 1:2–4'>Ezr 1:2–4</a> . <a ref='Ezra 5:14'>5:14</a> , <a ref='Ezra 5:16'>16</a> <b>Sheshbazzar … laid the foundations.</b> This seems to contradict the statement in <a ref='Ezra 3:8–10'>Ezr 3:8–10</a> that Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the Jewish workmen laid the foundation, but it actually does not, since Sheshbazzar was the political appointee of the Persian king over the Jews and thus is given official credit for work actually done by them. <i>See note on <a ref='Ezra 1:8'>1:8</a> .</i> <a ref='Ezra 6:1'>6:1</a> <b>King Darius issued a decree.</b> Rather than a public edict, this was a simple order issued to a small group of officials. <a ref='Ezra 6:1–2'>6:1–2</a> <b>Babylon … Ecbatana.</b> Ecbatana was one of the Persian capitals, 300 mi. northeast of Babylon in the foothills, where Cyrus and others had their summer homes. <a ref='Ezra 6:2'>6:2</a> <b>there was written.</b> A particular kind of document called a memorandum ( <a ref='Ezra 4:15'>Ezr 4:15</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 3:16'>Mal 3:16</a> ).

The Jews could draw from the provincial treasury. <a ref='Ezra 6:10'>6:10</a> <b>pray for the life of the king and his sons.</b> This was essentially the same self-serving motive that prompted Cyrus to decree that all captured peoples should return to their countries, rebuild the temples that Nebuchadnezzar and others had destroyed, and placate the offended deities.

It was the decree from God, the Sovereign of the universe, which gave administrative authority to rebuild the temple. The decrees (same word) of three of the greatest monarchs in the history of the ancient Near East were only a secondary issue. God rules the universe and He raises up kings, then pulls them from their thrones when they have served His administration. <b>Artaxerxes.</b> Although he did not contribute to the project under Zerubbabel, he did under Ezra (cf. <a ref='Ezra 7:11–26'>7:11–26</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 6:15'>6:15</a> <b>Adar … sixth year.</b> The 12th month (Feb./Mar.) in 516 BC. <a ref='Ezra 6:18'>6:18</a> <b>sections.</b> Cf. <a ref='1Ch 24'>1Chr 24</a> , where the priestly sections are delineated.

The title “King of Assyria” was held by every king who succeeded the great Neo-Assyrian Empire regardless of what country they may have come from. <a ref='Ezra 6:22–7:1'>6:22—7:1</a> The book of Esther fits in this 59-year gap between the completion of the temple (ca. 516 BC) under Zerubbabel ( <a ref='Ezr 1-6'>Ezr 1–6</a> ) and the second return (ca. 458 BC) under Ezra ( <a ref='Ezr 7-10'>Ezr 7–10</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 4:6'>Ezra 4:6</a> provides a glimpse into this period also. <a ref='Ezra 7:1–10:44'>7:1—10:44</a> This section covers the return of the second group to Judah, led by Ezra (ca. 458 BC). <a ref='Ezra 7:1'>7:1</a> <b>Artaxerxes.</b> King of Persia from 464–423 BC. <b>Ezra.</b> See Introduction: Author and Date . <b>son of.</b> Ezra traced his lineage back through such notable High Priests as Zadok ( <a ref='1 Kings 2:35'>1Ki 2:35</a> ), Phinehas ( <a ref='Numbers 25:10–13'>Nu 25:10–13</a> ), and Eleazar ( <a ref='Numbers 3:4'>Nu 3:4</a> ). The Times of Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Ezra 7:6'>7:6</a> <b>a scribe skilled in the law.</b> Ezra’s role as a scribe was critical to reinstate the nation since the leaders had to go back to the law and interpret it. This was no small task because many aspects of life had changed in the intervening 1,000 years since the law was first given. Tradition says Ezra had the law memorized and could write it from recall. <b>the hand of Yahweh his God</b> was <b>upon him.</b> This refrain occurs throughout the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Its resounding presence assures the reader that it was not by the shrewd leadership skills of a few men that Judah, with its temple and walls, was rebuilt in the midst of a powerful Medo-Persian Empire. Rather it was the sovereign hand of the wise and powerful King of the universe that allowed this to happen. <a ref='Ezra 7:7'>7:7</a> <b>temple servants.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Ezra 2:43–54'>2:43–54</a> .</i> <b>seventh year.</b> Ca. 458 BC. <a ref='Ezra 7:8–9'>7:8–9</a> The 4-month journey from Babylon to Jerusalem, covering almost 1,000 mi., started in Mar./Apr. and ended in Jul./Aug. <a ref='Ezra 7:10'>7:10</a> <b>study … practice … teach.</b> The pattern of Ezra’s preparation is exemplary. He studied before he attempted to live a life of obedience, and he studied and practiced the law in his own life before he opened his mouth to teach that law. But the success of Ezra’s leadership did not come from his strength alone, but most significantly because “the good hand of his God <i>was</i> upon him” ( <a ref='Ezra 7:9'>7:9</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 7:11'>7:11</a> <b>copy of the letter.</b> The original was usually kept for a record.

The effect of this decision would be to offer a measure of local autonomy to the Jews. <a ref='Ezra 8:1–14'>8:1–14</a> <b>from Babylon.</b> The list that follows no doubt includes those who lived in the surrounding areas. The total number of males in this section is 1,496 plus the men named, so with the addition of the women and children the number easily approaches 7,000 to 8,000. Just as these had not gone with the first group of returnees, so many Jews remained in Babylon after this group had departed. During the 70 years, many of the exiles had settled into a comfortable lifestyle. No small conflict arose between those who returned and those who stayed in Babylon. <a ref='Ezra 8:15'>8:15</a> <b>river … Ahava.</b> An unknown location where a canal/river flowed into the Euphrates. This was in Babylon and chosen for the place where the returning Jews would render vows for several days in preparation to leave. <b>not find any Levites.</b> There were no Levites who chose to return, so Ezra pursued such needed men by sending a command to Iddo, who was chief of the temple servants. Iddo’s influence brought 38 Levites and 220 temple servants (vv. <a ref='Ezra 8:16–20'>16–20</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 8:21–23'>8:21–23</a> <b>I called for a fast.</b> They would soon begin the long journey.

In the first settlement, Israel was warned not to make covenants with the nations, which would result in intermarriages and inevitably the worship of foreign gods ( <a ref='Exodus 34:10–17'>Ex 34:10–17</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:1–5'>Dt 7:1–5</a> ). To a great extent, the continual violation of this precipitated the 70-year exile from which they had just returned. Ezra found out it had happened again and called for immediate repentance. Nehemiah ( <a ref='Nehemiah 13:23–27'>Ne 13:23–27</a> ) and Malachi ( <a ref='Malachi 2:14–16'>Mal 2:14–16</a> ) later encountered the same sin. It is unthinkable that the Jews would so quickly go down the same disastrous path of idolatry. Neither wrath from God in the exile to Babylon, nor grace from God in the return was enough to keep them from defecting again. <b>Canaanites … Amorites.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Joshua 3:10'>Joshua 3:10</a> .</i> <a ref='Ezra 9:2'>9:2</a> <b>holy seed.</b> The seed of Abraham that God had set apart (cf. <a ref='Genesis 13:15–16'>Ge 13:15–16</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 17:4–14'>17:4–14</a> ) was not to be mixed with other nations; and if so, it violated God’s covenant (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:2–3'>Dt 7:2–3</a> ). This marriage with Gentile women would bring idolatry into the next generation for certain, so Ezra reacted strongly. <a ref='Ezra 9:3'>9:3</a> <b>tore … pulled … sat.</b> An outward expression of a grieving, disturbed spirit over sin (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 34:27'>2Chr 34:27</a> ) characterized Ezra as he saw the people returning to their old ways which would bring judgment again. <a ref='Ezra 9:4'>9:4</a> <b>trembled at the words.</b> In contrast to those who participated in the intermarriage, there were those who saw it as an abomination. They greatly feared Yahweh’s judgment on them again (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 66:2'>Is 66:2</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 66:5'>5</a> ) and sat with Ezra until the gathering of the people for the evening sacrifice, when there was surely public prayer and confession as Ezra fasted, lamented, and prayed (v. <a ref='Ezra 9:5'>5</a> ) in an effort to lead the leaders and people to repent. <a ref='Ezra 9:5–15'>9:5–15</a> Ezra’s priestly prayer of intercession and confession is like Daniel’s ( <a ref='Daniel 9:1–20'>Da 9:1–20</a> ) and Nehemiah’s ( <a ref='Nehemiah 1:4–11'>Ne 1:4–11</a> ), in that he used plural pronouns that identified himself with the people’s sin, even though he did not participate in it. The use of “we,” “our” and “us” demonstrates Ezra’s understanding that the sin of the few is sufficient to contaminate the many. <a ref='Ezra 9:8'>9:8</a> <b>a peg in His holy place.</b> A figure of speech that indicated permanence and prominence. <a ref='Ezra 9:8–9'>9:8–9</a> <b>grace … lovingkindness.</b> God had been true to His character and His covenant (cf. <a ref='Lamentations 3:22–23'>Lam 3:22–23</a> ) in restoring Israel, Jerusalem, and the temple. <a ref='Ezra 9:9'>9:9</a> <b>a wall.</b> As a people scattered all over the Fertile Crescent, the Jews were vulnerable to the nations. Together in Judah, with God as protector, they were safe. The wall does not exclude the walls of Jerusalem yet to be built, but it speaks more broadly of God’s provision for protection. <a ref='Ezra 9:10–12'>9:10–12</a> <b>Your commandments.</b> This is not a quotation of any single text of Scripture, but rather a summation of God’s commands on the subject (cf. <a ref='Exodus 34:15–17'>Ex 34:15–17</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:1–6'>Dt 7:1–6</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 9:13–14'>9:13–14</a> Cf. a similar situation in the first Exodus, when the Israelites engaged in idolatry and immorality led by Aaron, who was then confronted by Moses ( <a ref='Exodus 32:1–35'>Ex 32:1–35</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 9:14'>9:14</a> <b>no remnant.</b> Ezra feared that this sin would provoke the ultimate judgment of God and the abrogation of God’s unconditional covenants. While God would judge sin, the coming of Messiah and Paul’s insights on God’s continued faithfulness in His promise to the Jews ( <a ref='Ro 9-11'>Ro 9–11</a> ) assures that God’s calling of Israel as a beloved people and nation is irrevocable ( <a ref='Romans 11:25–29'>Ro 11:25–29</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 9:15'>9:15</a> <b>no one can stand before You.</b> All were reckoned guilty and had no right to stand in God’s presence, yet they came penitently seeking the grace of forgiveness. <a ref='Ezra 10:1'>10:1</a> <b>praying and making confession, weeping and prostrating.</b> Ezra’s contrite spirit before the people was evident and they joined him. These extreme expressions of contrition demonstrated the seriousness of the sin and the genuineness of their repentance. <a ref='Ezra 10:2'>10:2</a> <b>Shecaniah.</b> This leader, not involved in the mixed marriages since his name does not appear in the list in vv. <a ref='Ezra 10:18–44'>18–44</a> (though his father and 5 paternal uncles do appear in v. <a ref='Ezra 10:26'>26</a> ), was bold and chose to obey God rather than please his relatives. <b>hope for Israel in spite of this.</b> This hope is centered in God’s covenant love and forgiveness of truly repentant sinners. <a ref='Ezra 10:3'>10:3</a> <b>cut a covenant.</b> Shecaniah calls for the people and leaders to accomplish the specific action of divorcing the wives and children and acknowledges that Ezra has counseled a course of action consistent with Scripture (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 29:10'>2Chr 29:10</a> ). <b>those who tremble.</b> Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 66:2'>Is 66:2</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 66:5'>5</a> . This refers to those who take the Word of God seriously, especially His judgment on their sin. <b>according to the law.</b> They wanted to get in line with God’s law as revealed in <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:2–3'>Dt 7:2–3</a> . <a ref='Ezra 10:4'>10:4</a> <b>your responsibility.</b> Ezra is acknowledged as the chief spiritual leader with appropriate divine authority and human responsibility to take on the execution of this formidable task of dealing with divorces for so many (cf. vv. <a ref='Ezra 10:18–44'>18–44</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 10:5'>10:5</a> <b>swear</b> an oath <b>.</b> The oath in relation to the covenant specified in <a ref='Ezra 10:3'>10:3</a> . Cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 10:28–39'>Ne 10:28–39</a> for the content of a later oath under similar conditions. <a ref='Ezra 10:7'>10:7</a> <b>they made a proclamation.</b> A proclamation was delivered orally by a herald. It often had the force of law as did this one. Not participating in the assembly, as some might have been tempted to do, meant not just losing your property, but being ostracized from Israel. <a ref='Ezra 10:8'>10:8</a> <b>three days.</b> The message had to go out, and the people were required to respond within 72 hours. Since only the territories of Judah and Benjamin were involved, the greatest distance would have been no more than 40–50 mi. <a ref='Ezra 10:9'>10:9</a> <b>all the men.</b> Serious consequences highlighted the gravity of the situation, and thus everyone came. <b>Ninth month.</b> Dec./Jan., the time of the heaviest rains and coldest weather, especially in Jerusalem, which is over 2,500 ft. in elevation. <a ref='Ezra 10:11'>10:11</a> <b>confession … separate.</b> Here are the two essential elements of repentance—agreeing with God and taking righteous action to separate from sin. <a ref='Ezra 10:12–14'>10:12–14</a> <b>all … many people.</b> This demonstrates how widespread this sin was among the people. With the heavy rain and the large number of people to be processed, the whole operation could go long, so the people made an administrative suggestion for dealing with the magnitude of the problem. For each unlawful marriage, a questioning or court session could be locally conducted. All of these details had to be treated with great care; thus, delegating the court process was a suggestion much like Jethro’s back in the wilderness (cf. <a ref='Ex 18'>Ex 18</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 10:15'>10:15</a> <b>stood against this.</b> It is unclear whether these 4 stood against the delay in dealing with the situation or whether they stood against dealing with the sin at all. It was, however, a good plan and brought about a reasonably fast resolution. <a ref='Ezra 10:16–17'>10:16–17</a> <b>tenth month … first month.</b> It took 3 months to rectify the situation in all cases, after which the people were prepared to celebrate Passover with a clear conscience. <a ref='Ezra 10:18'>10:18</a> <b>the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers.</b> At the head of the list of those who had intermarried were the descendants and other relatives of the High Priest who first returned with Zerubbabel and led in the temple reconstruction. They set the example for all the people in giving the appropriate trespass offering (v. <a ref='Ezra 10:19'>19</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 10:18–44'>10:18–44</a> Given the fact that it took 3 months to resolve the situation, this list of 113 men could represent only those in leadership (cf. “many people,” <a ref='Ezra 10:13'>10:13</a> ). There were apparently more violators among the people. Even though the problem was dealt with directly, it would eventually reappear (cf. <a ref='Ne 9-10'>Ne 9–10</a> , <a ref='Ne 13'>13</a> ). <a ref='Ezra 10:44'>10:44</a> An appropriate provision was doubtlessly made for the divorced wives and the children.",
