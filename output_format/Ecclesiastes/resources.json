    "content": "The Book of Ecclesiastes Title The English title, Ecclesiastes, comes from the Greek and Latin translations of Solomon’s book. The LXX used the Greek term <i>ekklēsiastēs</i> for its title. It means “preacher,” derived from the word <i>ekklēsia</i> , translated “assembly” or “congregation” in the NT. Both the Greek and Latin versions derive their titles from the Hebrew title, <i>Qoheleth</i> , which means “one who calls or gathers” the people. It refers to the one who addresses the assembly; hence, the preacher (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:1–2'>1:1–2</a> , <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:27'>7:27</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:8–10'>12:8–10</a> ). Along with Ruth, Song of Songs, Esther, and Lamentations, Ecclesiastes stands with the OT books of the Megilloth, or “five scrolls.” Later rabbis read these books in the synagogue on 5 special occasions during the year—Ecclesiastes being read on Pentecost. Author and Date The autobiographical profile of the book’s writer unmistakably points to Solomon. Evidence abounds such as: 1) the titles fit Solomon, “son of David, king in Jerusalem” ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:1'>1:1</a> ) and “king over Israel in Jerusalem” ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:12'>1:12</a> ); 2) the author’s moral odyssey chronicles Solomon’s life ( <a ref='1Ki 2-11'>1Ki 2–11</a> ); and 3) the role of one who “taught the people knowledge” and wrote “many proverbs” ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:9'>12:9</a> ) corresponds to his life. All point to Solomon, the son of David, as the author. Once Solomon is accepted as the author, the date and occasion become clear. Solomon was writing, probably in his latter years (no later than ca. 931 BC), primarily to warn the young people of his kingdom, without omitting others. He warned them to avoid walking through life on the path of human wisdom; he exhorted them to live by the revealed wisdom of God ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:9–14'>12:9–14</a> ). Background and Setting Solomon’s reputation for possessing extraordinary wisdom fits the Ecclesiastes profile. David recognized his son’s wisdom ( <a ref='1 Kings 2:6'>1Ki 2:6</a> , <a ref='1 Kings 2:9'>9</a> ) before God gave Solomon an additional measure. After he received a “wise and discerning heart” from the Lord ( <a ref='1 Kings 3:7–12'>1Ki 3:7–12</a> ), Solomon gained renown for being exceedingly wise by rendering insightful decisions ( <a ref='1 Kings 3:16–28'>1Ki 3:16–28</a> ), a reputation that attracted “all the kings of the earth” to his courts ( <a ref='1 Kings 4:34'>1Ki 4:34</a> ). In addition, he composed songs and proverbs ( <a ref='1 Kings 4:32'>1Ki 4:32</a> ; cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:9'>12:9</a> ), activity befitting only the ablest of sages. Solomon’s wisdom, like Job’s wealth, surpassed the wisdom “of all the sons of the east” ( <a ref='1 Kings 4:30'>1Ki 4:30</a> ; <a ref='Job 1:3'>Job 1:3</a> ). The book is applicable to all who would listen and benefit, not so much from Solomon’s experiences, but from the principles he drew as a result. Its aim is to answer some of life’s most challenging questions, particularly where they seem contrary to Solomon’s expectations. This has led some unwisely to take the view that Ecclesiastes is a book of skepticism. But in spite of amazingly unwise behavior and thinking, Solomon never let go of his faith in God ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:13–14'>12:13–14</a> ). Historical and Theological Themes As is true with most biblical Wisdom literature, little historical narrative occurs in Ecclesiastes, apart from Solomon’s own personal pilgrimage. The kingly sage studied life with high expectations but repeatedly bemoaned its shortcomings, which he acknowledged were due to the curse ( <a ref='Genesis 3:14–19'>Ge 3:14–19</a> ). Ecclesiastes represents the painful autobiography of Solomon who, for much of his life, squandered God’s blessings on his own personal pleasure rather than God’s glory. He wrote to warn subsequent generations not to make the same tragic error, in much the same manner as Paul wrote to the Corinthians (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:18–31'>1Co 1:18–31</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:13–16'>2:13–16</a> ). The Hebrew word translated “vanity,” “vanities,” and “vain life” expresses the futile attempt to be satisfied apart from God. This word is used 38 times expressing the many things hard to understand about life. All earthly goals and ambitions when pursued as ends in themselves produce only emptiness. Paul was probably echoing Solomon’s dissatisfaction when he wrote, “… the creation was subjected to futility” (Solomon’s “vanity”; <a ref='Romans 8:19–21'>Ro 8:19–21</a> ). Solomon’s experience with the effects of the curse (see <a ref='Genesis 3:17–19'>Ge 3:17–19</a> ) led him to view life as “chasing after the wind.” Solomon asked, “What advantage does man have in all his labor…?” ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:3'>1:3</a> ), a question he repeated in <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:22'>2:22</a> and <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:9'>3:9</a> . The wise king gave over a considerable portion of the book to addressing this dilemma. The impossibility of discovering both the inner workings of God’s creation and the personal providence of God in Solomon’s life was also deeply troubling to the king, as it was to Job. But the reality of judgment for all, despite many unknowns, emerged as the great certainty. In light of this judgment by God, the only fulfilled life is one lived in proper recognition of God and service to Him. Any other kind of life is frustrating and pointless. A proper balance of the prominent “enjoy life” theme with that of “divine judgment” tethers the reader to Solomon’s God with the sure cord of faith. For a time, Solomon suffered from the imbalance of trying to enjoy life without regard for the fear of Yahweh’s judgment holding him on the path of obedience. In the end, he came to grasp the importance of obedience. The tragic results of Solomon’s personal experience, coupled with the insight of extraordinary wisdom, make Ecclesiastes a book from which all believers can be warned and grow in their faith (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:1–26'>2:1–26</a> ). This book shows that if one perceives each day of existence, labor, and basic provision as a gift from God, and accepts whatever God gives, then that person lives an abundant life (cf. <a ref='John 10:10'>Jn 10:10</a> ). However, one who looks to be satisfied apart from God will live with futility regardless of their accumulations. Interpretive Challenges The author’s declaration that “all is vanity” envelops the primary message of the book (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:2'>1:2</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:8'>12:8</a> ). The word translated “vanity” is used in at least 3 ways throughout the book. In each case, it looks at the nature of man’s activity “under the sun” as: 1) “fleeting,” which has in view the vapor-like (cf. <a ref='James 4:14'>Jas 4:14</a> ) or transitory nature of life; 2) “futile” or “meaningless,” which focuses on the cursed condition of the universe and the debilitating effects it has on man’s earthly experience; or 3) “incomprehensible” or “enigmatic,” which gives consideration to life’s unanswerable questions. Solomon draws upon all 3 meanings in Ecclesiastes. While the context in each case will determine which meaning Solomon is focusing upon, the most recurring meaning of <i>vanity</i> is “incomprehensible” or “unknowable,” referring to the mysteries of God’s purposes. Solomon’s conclusion to “fear God and keep His commandments” ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:13–14'>12:13–14</a> ) is more than the book’s summary; it is the only hope of the good life and the only reasonable response of faith and obedience to sovereign God. He precisely works out all activities under the sun, each in its time according to His perfect plan, but also discloses only as much as His perfect wisdom dictates and holds all men accountable. Those who refuse to take God and His Word seriously are doomed to lives of the severest vanity. Outline The book chronicles Solomon’s investigations and conclusions regarding man’s lifework, which combine all of his activity and its potential outcomes including limited satisfaction. The role of wisdom in experiencing success surfaces repeatedly, particularly when Solomon must acknowledge that God has not revealed all of the details. This leads Solomon to the conclusion that the primary issues of life after the Edenic fall involve divine blessings to be enjoyed and the divine judgment for which all must prepare. I.

A very important and repeated word for Solomon (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:19'>3:19</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:9'>5:9</a> , <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 6:7'>6:7</a> , <a ref='Ecclesiastes 6:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:11–12'>7:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 10:10'>10:10</a> ). Solomon looks at the fleeting moments of life and the seemingly small gain for man’s activity under the sun. The only lasting efforts are those designed to accomplish God’s purposes for eternity. <b>labor.</b> Work is not just one’s livelihood, but all of man’s activity in life. <b>under the sun.</b> The phrase appears about 30 times to describe daily life. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:4–7'>1:4–7</a> These pictures from God’s creation illustrate and underscore the futile repetition of human activity. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>generation … earth.</b> The essence of this comparison is permanence/impermanence without profit or “advantage.” The observer perceives life as an endless cycle of activity which, by itself, does not bring security or meaning to man’s experience. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:8–11'>1:8–11</a> This is a summary of sorts. Solomon looks at the effect of repetitious, enduring activity in God’s creation over many generations as compared to the brief, comparatively profitless activity of one man which fails to produce an enduring satisfaction, and he concludes that it is wearisome. Another harsh reality comes with the realization that nothing is new and nothing will be remembered. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>no remembrance.</b> A written record or some other object which serves as a reminder of these events, people, and things will be short-lived. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:12–6:9'>1:12—6:9</a> This section records Solomon’s ill-advised quest for greater wisdom. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>king over Israel.</b> See Introduction: Author and Date . <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>wisdom.</b> Solomon’s use of the term, in typical Hebrew fashion, is more practical than philosophical and implies more than knowledge. It carries notions of ability for proper behavior, success, common sense, and wit. <b>grievous endeavor.</b> Man’s search to understand is at times difficult, yet God-given (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:26'>2:26</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:10'>3:10</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:16–19'>5:16–19</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 6:2'>6:2</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:11'>8:11</a> , <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:9'>9:9</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:11'>12:11</a> ). <b>God.</b> The covenant name, Lord, is never used in Ecclesiastes. However, “God” is found almost 40 times. The emphasis is more on God’s sovereignty in creation and providence than His covenant relationship through redemption. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:14'>1:14</a> <b>striving after wind.</b> One aspect of life’s vanity is its fleeting character. Like the wind, much of what is desirable in life cannot be held in one’s hand (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:14'>1:14</a> , <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:11'>2:11</a> , <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:17'>17</a> , <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:26'>26</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 4:4'>4:4</a> , <a ref='Ecclesiastes 4:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Ecclesiastes 4:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:16'>5:16</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 6:9'>6:9</a> ).

In spite of man’s grandest efforts, some crooked matters will remain unstraightened. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:16'>1:16</a> <b>wisdom.</b> Cf. Introduction: Background and Setting . <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:17'>1:17</a> <b>I gave my heart to know.</b> When Solomon depended on empirical research rather than divine revelation to understand life, he found it to be an empty experience. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:18'>1:18</a> <b>wisdom … much vexation.</b> The expected outcome of wisdom is success. Success, in turn, should bring happiness. But Solomon concluded that there were no guarantees. This grieves the one who places his hope in human achievement alone. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:1–11'>2:1–11</a> Pleasure, although not necessarily evil, has its shortcomings, much like human wisdom. Solomon reflected upon his tragic experiences in attempting to draw satisfaction purely out of pleasure. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:1–2'>2:1–2</a> <b>test.</b> The investigation or test was crucial for Solomon. But the test was not scientific; rather it was a practical experiment to see what worked. He was interested in what a given act accomplished. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:3'>2:3</a> <b>stimulate.</b> In further tests on the human level, Solomon overemphasized human gratification at the expense of God’s glory. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:4–8'>2:4–8</a> Cf. <a ref='1Ki 4-10'>1Ki 4–10</a> for an amplified account of Solomon’s riches. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:8'>2:8</a> <b>many concubines.</b> This fits Solomon’s 700 wives and 300 concubines ( <a ref='1 Kings 11:3'>1Ki 11:3</a> ). Most likely this should be translated “harem,” which would refer to Solomon’s many women (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 11:3'>1Ki 11:3</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:10'>2:10</a> <b>reward.</b> Solomon’s portion in life. This was what he received for all his activity and effort. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:11'>2:11</a> <b>no advantage.</b> “Vanity” is defined in this context. The futility of the labor process is that Solomon had nothing of enduring and satisfying substance to show for it. Wisdom is no guarantee that one will achieve satisfaction, even in accomplishments comparable to Solomon’s. To expend God-given resources for human accomplishment alone is empty. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:12–17'>2:12–17</a> Human wisdom suffers another crucial shortcoming—it leaves both the wise and the fool empty-handed at the threshold of death. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:14'>2:14</a> <b>fool walks in darkness.</b> The fool is not one who is mentally deficient, but is morally bankrupt. It is not that he cannot learn wisdom, but that he won’t. He refuses to know, fear, and obey God. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:17'>2:17</a> <b>for the work which had been done.</b> Since it had no more lasting value than the folly of a fool, Solomon viewed even the great reward of his labor as a source of pain. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:18–22'>2:18–22</a> Cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 4:7–8'>4:7–8</a> . <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:18'>2:18</a> <b>hated all … my labor.</b> Solomon left the kingdom divided to Jeroboam and his son Rehoboam, both of whom squandered their opportunities ( <a ref='1Ki 12-14'>1Ki 12–14</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:21'>2:21</a> <b>portion.</b> The portion of one’s life that he must leave behind at death. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:24'>2:24</a> <b>nothing better.</b> Even with the limitations of this present life (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:12–13'>3:12–13</a> , <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:18–19'>5:18–19</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:15'>8:15</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:7'>9:7</a> ), humanity should rejoice in its temporal goodness. <b>from the hand of God.</b> Solomon’s strong view of God’s sovereignty brings comfort after an honest critique of what life in a cursed world entails. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:25'>2:25</a> <b>outside of Him.</b> Or “without Him” (i.e., God). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:26'>2:26</a> <b>give to one who is good.</b> The qualifier “before God” makes God’s prerogative the standard. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:1–8'>3:1–8</a> <b>an appointed time.</b> Not only does God fix the standard and withhold or dispense satisfaction ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:26'>2:26</a> ), but He also appoints “times.” Earthly pursuits are good in their proper place and time, but unprofitable when pursued as the chief goal (cf. vv. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:9–10'>9–10</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:9–10'>3:9–10</a> Earthly pursuits (vv. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:1–8'>1–8</a> ) are unprofitable when considered as life’s chief good, which was never intended by God. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:11'>3:11</a> <b>everything.</b> Every activity or event for which a culmination point may be fixed. <b>beautiful.</b> The phrase echoes “God saw … it was … good” ( <a ref='Genesis 1:31'>Ge 1:31</a> ). Even in a cursed universe, activity should not be meaningless. Its futility lies in the fickle satisfaction of man and his failure to trust the wisdom of sovereign God. <b>set eternity in their heart.</b> God made men for His eternal purpose, and nothing in post-Fall time can bring them complete satisfaction. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:12'>3:12</a> <b>to be glad and to do good.</b> These words capture the goal of Solomon’s message which he echoes and elaborates on in <a ref='Ecclesiastes 11:9–10'>11:9–10</a> and again in <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:13–14'>12:13–14</a> . <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:13'>3:13</a> <b>sees good in all his labor.</b> In accepting everything as a gift of his Creator, even in a cursed world, man is enabled to see “good” in all his work (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:24–25'>2:24–25</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:19'>5:19</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:14'>3:14</a> <b>fear Him.</b> Acknowledging God’s enduring and perfect work becomes grounds for reverence, worship, and meaning. Apart from God, man’s works are pitifully inadequate. The theme, “fear God,” also appears in <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:7'>5:7</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:12–13'>8:12–13</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:13'>12:13</a> . Solomon Reflects on Genesis Toward the end of his life, the penitent King Solomon pondered life in the wake of the fall and the outworking of man’s sin. Solomon drew the following conclusions, possibly from his own study of Genesis: 1. God created the heavens and earth with laws of design and regularity ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:2–7'>Ecc 1:2–7</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:1–8'>3:1–8</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 1:1–31'>Ge 1:1–31</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 8:22'>8:22</a> ). 2. Man is created from dust and returns to dust ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:20'>Ecc 3:20</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:7'>12:7</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 2:7'>Ge 2:7</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 3:19'>3:19</a> ). 3. God placed in man His life-giving breath ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:7'>Ecc 12:7</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 2:7'>Ge 2:7</a> ). 4. As God ordained it, marriage is one of life’s most enjoyable blessings ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:9'>Ecc 9:9</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 2:18–25'>Ge 2:18–25</a> ). 5. Divine judgment results from the fall ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:14–22'>Ecc 3:14–22</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 11:9'>11:9</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:14'>12:14</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 2:17'>Ge 2:17</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 3:1–19'>3:1–19</a> ). 6. The effect of the curse on creation is “vanity,” i.e., futility ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:5–8'>Ecc 1:5–8</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 3:17–19'>Ge 3:17–19</a> ). 7. Labor after the fall is difficult and yields little profit ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:3'>Ecc 1:3</a> , <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:13'>13</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:3'>2:3</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:9–11'>3:9–11</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 3:17–19'>Ge 3:17–19</a> ). 8. Death overcomes all creatures after the fall ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:8'>Ecc 8:8</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:4–5'>9:4–5</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 2:17'>Ge 2:17</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 3:19'>3:19</a> ). 9. After the fall, man’s heart is desperately wicked ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:20'>Ecc 7:20</a> , <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:29'>29</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:11'>8:11</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:3'>9:3</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 3:22'>Ge 3:22</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 6:5'>6:5</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 8:21'>8:21</a> ). 10. God withholds certain knowledge and wisdom from man for His wise, but unspoken, reasons ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 6:12'>Ecc 6:12</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:17'>8:17</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 3:22'>Ge 3:22</a> ). Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:17'>3:17</a> <b>God will judge … for a time … is there.</b> The culminating issue of Solomon’s “appointed time” discussion is that there is a time for judgment (cf. <a ref='John 5:28–29'>Jn 5:28–29</a> ). God’s judgment is a central theme in Solomon’s message for this book (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 11:9'>11:9</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:14'>12:14</a> ). Even where the word “judgment” is absent, the greater issue of divine retribution is often pervasive. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:18–19'>3:18–19</a> <b>fate.</b> The ultimate fate of man and beast is to die. Solomon isn’t looking at eternal destinies, but rather at what all earthly flesh shares in common. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:20'>3:20</a> <b>from the dust … to the dust.</b> <a ref='Genesis 3:19'>Genesis 3:19</a> is alluded to in the broadest sense, i.e., all of living creation will die and go to the grave. Neither heaven nor hell is considered here. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:21'>3:21</a> <b>the breath.</b> Man’s breath or physical life appears on the surface to be little different than that of an animal. In reality, man’s soul differs in that God has made him eternal (cf. v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:11'>11</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:22'>3:22</a> <b>after him.</b> Once again, death becomes the overshadowing reality. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 4:1–3'>4:1–3</a> The oppressiveness of some lives renders death more appealing. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 4:3'>4:3</a> <b>evil work.</b> Earthly life can be so disheartening as to make nonexistence preferable. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 4:4'>4:4</a> the result of <b>jealousy.</b> The lack of satisfaction with life leads some to conclude that everyone else has it better. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 4:5'>4:5</a> <b>folds his hands … consumes his own flesh.</b> Even the man who settles into idleness, living on what he takes from others, is self-tormented and never satisfied (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 9:20'>Is 9:20</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 44:20'>44:20</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 4:7–12'>4:7–12</a> The futility of labor alone without satisfaction and without any heir to experience its value is addressed (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:18–22'>2:18–22</a> , a complementary message). Life is better with companionship. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 4:13–16'>4:13–16</a> The cherished popularity of kings is precarious and short-lived. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 4:15'>4:15</a> <b>second lad.</b> This refers to the legitimate successor to the “old and foolish king,” as opposed to the “poor yet wise lad” (cf. v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 4:13'>13</a> ) who rises on his ability to reign. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:1–7'>5:1–7</a> A prelude to the book’s concluding admonition to approach God with reverence. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:1'>5:1</a> <b>the house of God.</b> The temple Solomon built in Jerusalem (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 8:15–21'>1Ki 8:15–21</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:2'>5:2</a> <b>heaven … earth.</b> Because God is in heaven and man is on earth, rash promises and arguments before Him are foolish. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:4–5'>5:4–5</a> <b>vow and not pay.</b> Promises made to God have serious implications. The OT background for this admonition is found in <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:21–23'>Dt 23:21–23</a> ; <a ref='Judges 11:35'>Jdg 11:35</a> . Ananias and Sapphira learned the hard way (cf. <a ref='Acts 5:1–11'>Ac 5:1–11</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:6'>5:6</a> <b>mouth to cause your flesh to sin.</b> Don’t vow something that your fleshly desire will cause you to break. <b>messenger.</b> The priest in the house of God (cf. <a ref='Malachi 2:7'>Mal 2:7</a> ). Both priests and prophets are called messengers, commissaries who deliver and report back messages for the Heavenly King (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 6:1–13'>Is 6:1–13</a> ). Don’t tell them your broken vow was a small thing. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:7'>5:7</a> <b>fear God.</b> Cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:14'>3:14</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:12–13'>8:12–13</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:13'>12:13</a> . <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:8–9'>5:8–9</a> Officials have an unfair advantage to attain wealth. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:10'>5:10</a> The love of money is never satisfied (cf. <a ref='1 Timothy 6:9–10'>1Ti 6:9–10</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:11'>5:11</a> <b>those who consume them increase.</b> This refers to the rich man’s dependents. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:12–17'>5:12–17</a> Earthly treasures are precarious and bring disadvantages; they produce anxiety (v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:12'>12</a> ) and pain (v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:13'>13</a> ). They disappear through bad business (v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:14'>14</a> ) and are left at death (v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:15'>15</a> ). They can even produce fear (v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:17'>17</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:18–20'>5:18–20</a> In contrast to the anxiety of those just described (vv. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:12–17'>12–17</a> ), for those who consider God as the source of wealth, there are pleasures, riches, and the ability to enjoy them (see <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:24'>2:24</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:18'>5:18</a> <b>beautiful.</b> The same word translated in <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:11'>3:11</a> “beautiful.” Once again, Solomon uses an admonition to enjoy the richness of life that God gives. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:19'>5:19</a> <b>the gift of God.</b> To understand this is to enjoy the satisfaction of His good gifts. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:20'>5:20</a> <b>God allows him to occupy himself.</b> When a person recognizes the goodness of God, he rejoices and does not dwell unduly on the troubles detailed in the previous context. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 6:2'>6:2</a> <b>God does not empower him to eat.</b> Yahweh gives and takes away for His own purposes. So, the blessings of God cannot be assumed or taken for granted. But they should be enjoyed with thankfulness while they are available. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 6:3–6'>6:3–6</a> Not having a burial, as in the case of King Jehoiakim ( <a ref='Jeremiah 22:18–19'>Jer 22:18–19</a> ), indicated complete disrespect and disregard for one’s life. To die without mourners or honors was considered worse than being born dead, even if one had many children and a full life. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 6:3'>6:3</a> This is hyperbole. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 6:7–12'>6:7–12</a> Lack of soul satisfaction comes from working only for what is consumed (v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 6:7'>7</a> ), seeing little difference in the end between the wise and foolish (v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 6:8'>8</a> ), not knowing the future (v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 6:9'>9</a> ), realizing that God alone controls everything (v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 6:10'>10</a> ), and true understanding of the present and future is limited (vv. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 6:11–12'>11–12</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:1'>7:1</a> <b>good name.</b> Where a man has so lived to earn a good reputation, the day of his death can be a time of honor. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:2–6'>7:2–6</a> The point of this section is to emphasize that more is learned from adversity than from pleasure. True wisdom is developed in the crucible of life’s trials, though the preacher wishes that were not the case when he writes “this too is vanity” (v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:6'>6</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:10'>7:10</a> <b>former days.</b> In the midst of trouble and discontent, it is easy to lose touch with reality. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:12'>7:12</a> <b>wisdom is …</b> protection <b>.</b> Wisdom is better than money because it provides the fulfilled life. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:13'>7:13</a> <b>straighten what He has bent?</b> Man should consider God’s activity because God is sovereign, decreeing and controlling everything under the sun (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:15'>1:15</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:14'>7:14</a> there is <b>good …</b> there is <b>evil.</b> God ordains both kinds of days and withholds knowledge of the future. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:15–18'>7:15–18</a> The focus on the nature of righteousness is made clear in the statement “For the one who fears God comes forth with both of them” (v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:18'>18</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:15'>7:15</a> <b>perishes … prolongs.</b> The fact that some righteous men die young and some wicked men live long is enigmatic (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:11–12'>8:11–12</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:16'>7:16</a> <b>excessively righteous … overly wise.</b> Solomon has already exhorted his readers to be righteous and wise (cf. v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:19'>19</a> ). The warning here is against being self-righteous or pharisaical. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:19'>7:19</a> <b>Wisdom strengthens.</b> The measure of wisdom is its ability to bring good outcomes in life. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:20'>7:20</a> <b>does good … never sins.</b> Solomon gave great emphasis to the general effects of sin (cf. <a ref='Genesis 3:1–24'>Ge 3:1–24</a> ) and also pointed out the universality of personal transgressions. Paul may have recalled this passage when he wrote <a ref='Romans 3:10'>Ro 3:10</a> . <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:21–22'>7:21–22</a> <b>words which are spoken.</b> Since you have many offensive words to be forgiven, don’t keep strict accounts of other’s offensive words against you. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:23–24'>7:23–24</a> <b>“I will be wise” … Who can find it?</b> The already wise king resolves to be even wiser. But upon further investigation, the limitations of wisdom become apparent. Some things are unknowable. This realization quickly dampens his enthusiasm. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:26'>7:26</a> <b>the woman.</b> This is the seductress about whom Solomon warns young men in Proverbs ( <a ref='Proverbs 2:16–19'>Pr 2:16–19</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 5:1–14'>5:1–14</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 6:24–29'>6:24–29</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 7:1–27'>7:1–27</a> ). Elsewhere, Solomon exalts the virtues of man’s lifetime companion ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:9'>Ecc 9:9</a> ; cf. <a ref='Proverbs 5:15–23'>Pr 5:15–23</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 31:10–31'>31:10–31</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:27–29'>7:27–29</a> Empirical acquisition of knowledge, that is man seeking righteousness through his many schemes, fails. Only God can make man upright. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 7:29'>7:29</a> <b>many devices.</b> The same word is translated “intent” and reflects the evil imaginations of all human beings since Adam and Eve. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:2–3'>8:2–3</a> <b>the oath … before God.</b> This refers to Israel’s promises to serve King Solomon ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 29:24'>1Chr 29:24</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:5–6'>8:5–6</a> proper <b>time and custom.</b> A wise man knows when to apply the proper course of action for the best outcome, whether in an earthly sense before the king ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:2'>8:2</a> ) or an eternal sense before God (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:13–14'>12:13–14</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:7'>8:7</a> <b>what … when.</b> God has appointed a time for everything, but man knows neither the time nor the outcome. These uncertainties can increase his misery. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:8'>8:8</a> <b>wind.</b> Death is as precarious and uncontrollable as the wind. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:10'>8:10</a> <b>the holy place.</b> This refers to the temple at Jerusalem (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:1'>5:1</a> ). <b>vanity.</b> Lessons that should be gained from the death of the hypocritically wicked are quickly forgotten. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:11'>8:11</a> <b>the sentence.</b> The gracious delay of God’s retribution leads to further disobedience. This delay, in actuality, in no way diminishes the certainty of final judgment. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:12–13'>8:12–13</a> <b>those who fear God … the wicked man.</b> There is no real advantage for the wicked, although at times it might seem so (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:7'>5:7</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:13–14'>12:13–14</a> ). Temporal patience does not eliminate eternal judgment. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:14'>8:14</a> <b>vanity.</b> Temporally speaking, God generally rewards obedience and punishes disobedience. Solomon regards the exceptions to this principle as enigmatic and discouraging (see <a ref='Ps 73'>Ps 73</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:15'>8:15</a> <b>gladness.</b> In no way does Solomon commend unbridled, rampant indulgence in sin, which is implied in Christ’s account of the man whose barns were full. That man may have justified his sin by quoting this passage (cf. <a ref='Luke 12:19'>Lk 12:19</a> ). His focus here is on the resolve to enjoy life in the face of the injustice which surrounded him (see <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:24'>2:24</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:16–17'>8:16–17</a> <b>every work of God.</b> God’s work is wonderful, but at times incomprehensible. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:1'>9:1</a> <b>in the hand of God.</b> There will be no inequities in the final judgment of the righteous or the wicked, because God remembers both in perfect detail. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:2–3'>9:2–3</a> <b>one fate for all.</b> Death because of universal depravity. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:7'>9:7</a> <b>eat … drink.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:24'>2:24</a> .</i> <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:9'>9:9</a> <b>the woman.</b> Cf. <a ref='Proverbs 5:15–19'>Pr 5:15–19</a> and Solomon’s Song. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:11'>9:11</a> <b>time and misfortune.</b> Wisdom cannot guarantee good outcomes because of what appear to be so many unpredictable contingencies. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:12'>9:12</a> <b>his time.</b> The time of his misfortune, especially death (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 11:8'>11:8</a> , “days of darkness”; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:1'>12:1</a> , “evil days”). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:13–15'>9:13–15</a> Wisdom may not receive its due in this life. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:16'>9:16</a> This is true because he lacks status and position. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 10:1–20'>10:1–20</a> Solomon draws together assorted examples of the wisdom he has both scrutinized and touted. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 10:2'>10:2</a> <b>right … left.</b> This proverb is based on the fact that, commonly, the right hand is more deft than the left. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 10:3'>10:3</a> <b>fool.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:14'>2:14</a> .</i> <b>walks.</b> A person lacking wisdom will manifest that in daily conduct. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 10:5'>10:5</a> It is a great and far-reaching evil when leaders make bad judgments. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 10:6–7'>10:6–7</a> <b>rich men … princes.</b> Life presents some strange ironies and is not, in this world, always fair. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 10:8–10'>10:8–10</a> <b>digs … does not sharpen.</b> Dangers and uncertainties abound in life. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 10:10'>10:10</a> <b>Wisdom … giving success.</b> A little wisdom will ease the efforts of life. Even though life’s experiences often don’t turn out the way one would have hoped, wise living usually produces a good outcome. This is a very important conclusion for Solomon’s testing of wisdom. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 10:12–14'>10:12–14</a> <b>Words.</b> Man demonstrates wisdom in words as well as works. Foolish words yield unfavorable outcomes. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 10:15'>10:15</a> <b>to go to a city.</b> A proverb for ignorance with regard to the most ordinary matters, which extends even to spiritual realities. If a fool can’t find a town, how could he possibly locate God? <a ref='Ecclesiastes 10:18'>10:18</a> <b>beams sag … house leaks.</b> This is likely an analogy for the kingdom of a lazy monarch. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 10:19'>10:19</a> <b>money is the answer to everything.</b> The partying king of v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 10:18'>18</a> thinks he can fix all the disasters of his inept reign by raising taxes. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 11:1'>11:1</a> <b>Cast your bread.</b> Take a calculated and wise step forward in life, like a farmer who throws his seed on the wet or marshy ground and waits for it to grow (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 32:20'>Is 32:20</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 11:2'>11:2</a> <b>Divide.</b> Be generous while there is plenty, and make friends while time remains, because one never knows when he might need them to return the favor. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 11:3–6'>11:3–6</a> The world is full of things over which one has no control, including the purposes of God. There is no virtue in wishful wondering, but there is hope for those who get busy and do their work. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 11:7–12:8'>11:7—12:8</a> Solomon crystallizes the book’s message. Death is imminent and with it comes retribution. Enjoyment and judgment, though strange partners, come together in this section because both clamor for man’s deepest commitment. Surprisingly, one does not win out over the other. In a world created for enjoyment but damaged by sin, judgment and enjoyment/pleasure are held in tension. With too much pleasure, judgment stands as a threatening force; with too much judgment, enjoyment suffers. In the final analysis, both are prominent themes of life that are resolved in our relationship to God, the primary issue of life and this book. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 11:7'>11:7</a> <b>light.</b> Good times in contrast to “darkness” (v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 11:8'>8</a> ), meaning bad times. Cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:1'>12:1</a> . <a ref='Ecclesiastes 11:9'>11:9</a> <b>Be glad … judgment.</b> The two terms seem to cancel out the other. How can this be explained? Enjoy life but do not commit iniquity. The balance that is called for ensures that enjoyment is not reckless, sinful abandonment. Pleasure is experienced in faith and obedience, for as Solomon has said repeatedly, one can only receive true satisfaction as a gift from God. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 11:10'>11:10</a> <b>vanity.</b> Enjoy childhood and youth while you can because they are soon gone. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:1'>12:1</a> <b>Remember … your Creator … evil days.</b> Remember you are God’s property, so serve Him from the start of your years, not the end of your years, when service is very limited. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:2–6'>12:2–6</a> Solomon uses the imagery of aging, incorporating elements of a dilapidated house, nature, and a funeral procession to heighten the emphasis of <a ref='Ecclesiastes 11:7–12:1'>11:7—12:1</a> . <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:2'>12:2</a> <b>sun … moon … clouds.</b> Youth is typically the time of dawning light, old age the time of twilight’s gloom. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:3'>12:3</a> <b>watchmen of the house tremble.</b> The hands and arms which protect the body, as guards do a palace, shake in old age. <b>valiant men bend down.</b> The legs, like supporting pillars, weaken. <b>grinding ones.</b> Teeth. <b>those who look through windows.</b> Eyes. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:4'>12:4</a> <b>doors.</b> Lips that do not have much to say. <b>sound of the grinding.</b> This refers to little eating, when the sound of masticating is low. <b>arise.</b> Light sleep. <b>daughters of song.</b> The ear and voice that once loved music. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:5'>12:5</a> <b>afraid of a high place.</b> For fear of falling. <b>almond tree blooms.</b> A white blossoming tree among dark trees speaks of hair. <b>mourners.</b> The funeral is near. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:6–7'>12:6–7</a> Here are the images of death. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:6'>12:6</a> <b>silver cord is snapped.</b> Perhaps this pictures a lamp hanging from a silver chain, which breaks with age, smashing the lamp. Some suggest this refers to the spinal cord. <b>golden bowl.</b> Possibly this refers to the brain. <b>pitcher … spring … wheel.</b> Springs (wells) required a wheel with a rope attached in order to lower the pitcher for water. Perhaps this pictures the fountain of blood, the heart. <b>snapped … crushed … broken … crushed.</b> All of these actions portray death as tragic and irreversible. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:7'>12:7</a> <b>dust … spirit.</b> Solomon recalls <a ref='Genesis 2:7'>Ge 2:7</a> and <a ref='Genesis 3:19'>3:19</a> as he contemplates the end of the aging process. <b>spirit … return to … who gave it.</b> The sage ends his message with the culmination of a human life. “Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away” ( <a ref='Job 1:21'>Job 1:21</a> ; cf. <a ref='1 Timothy 6:7'>1Ti 6:7</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:7–8'>12:7–8</a> This gloomy picture of old age does not negate the truth that old age can be blessed for the godly ( <a ref='Proverbs 16:31'>Pr 16:31</a> ), but it does remind the young that they will not have the ability to enjoy that blessing of a godly old age and a life of strong service to God if they do not remember their Creator while young (v. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:1'>1</a> ). <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:9–14'>12:9–14</a> Solomon’s final words of advice. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:11'>12:11</a> <b>goads … well-driven nails.</b> Two shepherd’s tools are in view: one used to motivate reluctant animals, the other to secure those who might otherwise wander into dangerous territory. Both goads and nails picture aspects of applied wisdom. <b>one Shepherd.</b> True wisdom has its source in God alone. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:12'>12:12</a> <b>books.</b> Books written on any other subject than God’s revealed wisdom will only proliferate the uselessness of man’s thinking. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:13–14'>12:13–14</a> <b>fear God.</b> Solomon’s final word on the issues raised in this book, as well as life itself, focuses on one’s relationship to God. All of the concern for a life under the sun, with its pleasures and uncertainties, was behind Solomon. Such things seemed comparatively irrelevant to him as he faced the end of his life. But death, in spite of the focused attention he had given to it in Ecclesiastes, was not the greatest equalizer. Judgment/retribution is the real equalizer as Solomon saw it, for God will bring every person’s every act to judgment. Unbelievers will stand at the Great White Throne judgment (cf. <a ref='Revelation 20:11–15'>Rev 20:11–15</a> ) and believers before Christ at the Bema judgment (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:10–15'>1Co 3:10–15</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:9–10'>2Co 5:9–10</a> ). When all is said and done, the certainty and finality of retribution give life the meaning for which David’s oft-times foolish son had been searching. Whatever may be one’s portion in life, accountability to God, whose ways are often mysterious, is both eternal and irrevocable.",
