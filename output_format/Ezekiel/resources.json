    "content": "The Book of Ezekiel Title The book has always been named for its author, Ezekiel ( <a ref='Ezekiel 1:3'>1:3</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 24:24'>24:24</a> ), who is nowhere else mentioned in Scripture. His name means “strengthened by God,” which, indeed, he was for the prophetic ministry to which God called him ( <a ref='Ezekiel 3:8–9'>3:8–9</a> ). Ezekiel uses visions, prophecies, parables, signs, and symbols to proclaim and dramatize the message of God to His exiled people. Author and Date If the “thirtieth year” of <a ref='Ezekiel 1:1'>1:1</a> refers to Ezekiel’s age, he was 25 when taken captive and 30 when called into ministry. Thirty was the age when priests commenced their office, so it was a notable year for Ezekiel. His ministry began in 593/92 BC and extended at least 22 years until 571/70 BC (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 25:17'>25:17</a> ). He was a contemporary of both Jeremiah (who was about 20 years older) and Daniel (who was the same age), whom he names in <a ref='Ezekiel 14:14'>14:14</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 14:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 28:3'>28:3</a> as an already well-known prophet. Like Jeremiah ( <a ref='Jeremiah 1:1'>Jer 1:1</a> ) and Zechariah (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 1:1'>Zec 1:1</a> with <a ref='Nehemiah 12:16'>Ne 12:16</a> ), Ezekiel was both a prophet and a priest ( <a ref='Ezekiel 1:3'>1:3</a> ). Because of his priestly background, he was particularly interested in and familiar with the temple details; so God used him to write much about them ( <a ref='Ezekiel 8:1–11:25'>8:1—11:25</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 40:1–47:12'>40:1—47:12</a> ). Ezekiel and his wife (who is mentioned in <a ref='Ezekiel 24:15–27'>24:15–27</a> ) were among 10,000 Jews taken captive to Babylon in 597 BC ( <a ref='2 Kings 24:11–18'>2Ki 24:11–18</a> ). They lived in Tel-abib ( <a ref='Ezekiel 3:15'>3:15</a> ) on the bank of the Chebar River, probably southeast of Babylon. Ezekiel writes of his wife’s death in exile ( <a ref='Ezekiel 24:18'>Eze 24:18</a> ), but the book does not mention Ezekiel’s death, which rabbinical tradition suggests occurred at the hands of an Israelite prince whose idolatry he rebuked around 560 BC. The author received his call to prophesy in 593 BC ( <a ref='Ezekiel 1:2'>1:2</a> ), in Babylon (“the land of the Chaldeans”), during the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity, which began in 597 BC. Frequently, Ezekiel dates his prophecies from 597 BC ( <a ref='Ezekiel 8:1'>8:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 20:1'>20:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 24:1'>24:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 26:1'>26:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 29:1'>29:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 30:20'>30:20</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 31:1'>31:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 32:1'>32:1</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 32:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 33:21'>33:21</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 40:1'>40:1</a> ). He also dates the message in <a ref='Ezekiel 40:1'>40:1</a> as 573/72, the 14th year after 586 BC, i.e., Jerusalem’s final fall. The last dated utterance of Ezekiel was in 571/70 BC ( <a ref='Ezekiel 29:17'>29:17</a> ). Prophecies in chaps. <a ref='Eze 1-28'>1–28</a> are in chronological order. In <a ref='Ezekiel 29:1'>29:1</a> , the prophet regresses to a year earlier than in <a ref='Ezekiel 26:1'>26:1</a> . But from <a ref='Ezekiel 30:1'>30:1</a> on (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 31:1'>31:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 32:1'>32:1</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 32:17'>17</a> ), he is close to being strictly chronological. Background and Setting From the historical perspective, Israel’s united kingdom lasted more than 110 years (ca. 1043–931 BC), through the reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon. Then the divided kingdom, Israel (north) and Judah (south), extended from 931 BC to 722/21 BC. Israel fell to Assyria in 722/21 BC, leaving Judah, the surviving kingdom for 135 years, which fell to Babylon in 605–586 BC. In the more immediate setting, several features were strategic. Politically, Assyria’s vaunted military might crumbled after 626 BC, and the capital, Nineveh, was destroyed in 612 BC by the Babylonians and Medes (cf. Nahum). The neo-Babylonian Empire had flexed its muscles since Nabopolassar took the throne in 625 BC, and Egypt, under Pharaoh Neco II, was determined to conquer what she could. Babylon smashed Assyria in 612–605 BC, and registered a decisive victory against Egypt in 605 BC at Carchemish, leaving, according to the Babylonian Chronicle, no survivors. Also in 605 BC, Babylon, led by Nebuchadnezzar, began the conquest of Jerusalem and the deportation of captives, among them Daniel ( <a ref='Daniel 1:2'>Da 1:2</a> ). In Dec., 598 BC, he again besieged Jerusalem, and on Mar. 16, 597 BC he took possession. This time, he took captive Jehoiachin and a group of 10,000, including Ezekiel ( <a ref='2 Kings 24:11–18'>2Ki 24:11–18</a> ). The final destruction of Jerusalem and the conquest of Judah, including the third deportation, came in 586 BC. Religiously, King Josiah (ca. 640–609 BC) had instituted reforms in Judah (cf. <a ref='2Ch 34'>2Chr 34</a> ). Tragically, despite his effort, idolatry had so dulled the Judeans that their awakening was only “skin deep” overall. The Egyptian army killed Josiah as it crossed Israel in 609 BC, and the Jews plunged on in sin toward judgment under Jehoahaz (609 BC), Jehoiakim [Eliakim] (609–598 BC), Jehoiachin (598–597 BC), and Zedekiah (597–586 BC). Domestically, Ezekiel and the 10,000 lived in exile in Babylonia ( <a ref='2 Kings 24:14'>2Ki 24:14</a> ), more as colonists than captives, being permitted to farm tracts of land under somewhat favorable conditions ( <a ref='Je 29'>Jer 29</a> ). Ezekiel even had his own house ( <a ref='Ezekiel 3:24'>3:24</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 20:1'>20:1</a> ). Prophetically, false prophets deceived the exiles with assurances of a speedy return to Judah ( <a ref='Ezekiel 13:3'>13:3</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 13:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 29:1'>Jer 29:1</a> ). From 593–585 BC, Ezekiel warned that their beloved Jerusalem would be destroyed and their exile prolonged, so there was no hope of immediate return. In 585 BC, an escapee from Jerusalem, who had evaded the Babylonians, reached Ezekiel with the first news that the city had fallen in 586 BC, about 6 months earlier ( <a ref='Ezekiel 33:21'>33:21</a> ). That dashed the false hopes of any immediate deliverance for the exiles, so the remainder of Ezekiel’s prophecies related to Israel’s future restoration to its homeland and the final blessings of the messianic kingdom. Historical and Theological Themes The “glory of Yahweh” is central to Ezekiel, appearing in <a ref='Ezekiel 1:28'>1:28</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 3:12'>3:12</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 3:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 10:4'>10:4</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 10:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 11:23'>11:23</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 43:4–5'>43:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 44:4'>44:4</a> . The book includes graphic descriptions of the disobedience of Israel and Judah, despite God’s kindness (chap. <a ref='Eze 23'>23</a> ; cf. chap. <a ref='Eze 16'>16</a> ). It shows God’s desire for Israel to bear fruit which He can bless; however, selfish indulgence had left Judah ready for judgment, like a torched vine (chap. <a ref='Eze 15'>15</a> ). References are plentiful to Israel’s idolatry and its consequences, such as Pelatiah dropping dead ( <a ref='Ezekiel 11:13'>11:13</a> ), a symbolic illustration of overall disaster for the people. Many picturesque scenes illustrate spiritual principles. Among these are Ezekiel eating a scroll (chap. <a ref='Eze 2'>2</a> ); the faces on 4 angels representing aspects of creation over which God rules ( <a ref='Ezekiel 1:10'>1:10</a> ); a “barbershop” scene ( <a ref='Ezekiel 5:1–4'>5:1–4</a> ); graffiti on temple walls reminding readers of what God really wants in His dwelling place, namely holiness and not ugliness ( <a ref='Ezekiel 8:10'>8:10</a> ); and sprinkled hot coals depicting judgment ( <a ref='Ezekiel 10:2'>10:2</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 10:7'>7</a> ). Chief among the theological themes are God’s holiness and sovereignty. These are conveyed by frequent contrast of His bright glory against the despicable backdrop of Judah’s sins ( <a ref='Ezekiel 1:26–28'>1:26–28</a> ; often in chaps. <a ref='Eze 8-11'>8–11</a> ; and <a ref='Ezekiel 43:1–7'>43:1–7</a> ). Closely related is God’s purpose of glorious triumph so that all may “know that I am Yahweh.” This divine monogram, God’s signature authenticating His acts, is mentioned more than 60 times, usually with a judgment ( <a ref='Ezekiel 6:7'>6:7</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 7:4'>7:4</a> ), but occasionally after the promised restoration ( <a ref='Ezekiel 34:27'>34:27</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 36:11'>36:11</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 36:38'>38</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 39:28'>39:28</a> ). Another feature involves God’s angels carrying out His program behind the scenes ( <a ref='Ezekiel 1:5–25'>1:5–25</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 10:1–22'>10:1–22</a> ). A further important theme is God’s holding each individual accountable for pursuing righteousness ( <a ref='Ezekiel 18:3–32'>18:3–32</a> ). Ezekiel also stresses sinfulness in Israel ( <a ref='Ezekiel 2:3–7'>2:3–7</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 8:9–10'>8:9–10</a> ) and other nations (throughout chaps. <a ref='Eze 25-32'>25–32</a> ). He deals with the necessity of God’s wrath to deal with sin ( <a ref='Ezekiel 7:1–8'>7:1–8</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 15:8'>15:8</a> ); God’s frustration of man’s devices to escape from besieged Jerusalem ( <a ref='Ezekiel 12:1–13'>12:1–13</a> ; cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 39:4–7'>Jer 39:4–7</a> ); and God’s grace pledged in the Abrahamic Covenant ( <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> ) being fulfilled by restoring Abraham’s people to the land of the covenant (chaps. <a ref='Eze 34'>34</a> , <a ref='Eze 36-48'>36–48</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 12:7'>Ge 12:7</a> ). God promises to preserve a remnant of Israelites through whom He will fulfill His restoration promises and keep His inviolate Word. Interpretive Challenges Ezekiel uses extensive symbolic language, as did Isaiah and Jeremiah. This raises the question as to whether certain portions of Ezekiel’s writings are to be taken literally or figuratively, e.g., being bound with ropes, <a ref='Ezekiel 3:25'>3:25</a> ; whether the prophet was taken bodily to Jerusalem, <a ref='Ezekiel 8:1–3'>8:1–3</a> ; how individual judgment can be worked out in chap. <a ref='Eze 18'>18</a> when the wicked elude death in <a ref='Ezekiel 14:22–23'>14:22–23</a> and some of the godly die in an invasion, <a ref='Ezekiel 21:3–4'>21:3–4</a> ; how God would permit a faithful prophet’s wife to die ( <a ref='Ezekiel 24:15–27'>24:15–27</a> ); when some of the judgments on other nations will occur (chaps. <a ref='Eze 25-32'>25–32</a> ); whether the temple in chaps. <a ref='Eze 40-46'>40–46</a> will be a literal one and in what form; and how promises of Israel’s future relate to God’s program with the church. These issues will be treated in the study notes. Outline The book can be largely divided into sections about condemnation/retribution and then consolation/restoration. A more detailed look divides the book into 4 sections. First, are prophecies on the ruin of Jerusalem (chaps. <a ref='Eze 1-24'>1–24</a> ). Second, are prophecies of retribution on nearby nations (chaps. <a ref='Eze 25-32'>25–32</a> ), with a glimpse at God’s future restoration of Israel ( <a ref='Ezekiel 28:25–26'>28:25–26</a> ). Thirdly, there is a transition chapter ( <a ref='Eze 33'>33</a> ) which gives instruction concerning a last call for Israel to repent. Finally, the fourth division includes rich expectations involving God’s future restoration of Israel (chaps. <a ref='Eze 34-48'>34–48</a> ). I.

The number 4 may have respect to the 4 corners of the earth, implying that God’s angels execute His commands everywhere. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:6'>1:6</a> <b>four faces.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:10'>10</a> .</i> <b>four wings.</b> Four wings instead of two symbolize speed in performing God’s will (cf. v. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 1:7'>1:7</a> <b>legs.</b> They were not bent like an animal’s, but “straight” like pillars, showing strength. <b>calf’s hoof.</b> This points to their stability and firm stance. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>hands of a man.</b> This is a symbol of their skillful service. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>did not turn.</b> They were able to move in any direction without needing to turn, giving swift access to do God’s will. Apparently, all were in harmony as to the way they moved (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:12'>12</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 1:10'>1:10</a> <b>faces.</b> These symbols identify the angels as intelligent (“man”), powerful (“lion”), servile (“bull”), and swift (“eagle”). <a ref='Ezekiel 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>the spirit.</b> This refers to the divine impulse by which God moved them to do His will (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:20'>1:20</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>like … fire … torches.</b> Their appearance conveyed God’s glory and pure, burning justice (cf. <a ref='Is 6'>Is 6</a> ) which they assisted in carrying out even on Israel, who had for so long hardened themselves against His patience. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:14'>1:14</a> Intense, relentless motion signifies God’s constant work of judgment. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:15–25'>1:15–25</a> This section looks at the glory of God’s throne in heaven. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:15'>1:15</a> <b>one wheel.</b> This depicts God’s judgment as a war machine (like a massive chariot) moving where He is to judge. The cherubim above the ark are called chariots in <a ref='1 Chronicles 28:18'>1Chr 28:18</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 1:16'>1:16</a> <b>as if one wheel were within another.</b> This depicted the gigantic (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:15'>15</a> , “on the earth” and “lofty,” v. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:18'>18</a> ) energy of the complicated revolutions of God’s massive judgment machinery bringing about His purposes with unerring certainty. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:17'>1:17</a> <b>without turning.</b> Cf. vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 1:12'>12</a> . The judgment machine moved where the angels went (cf. vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:19–20'>19–20</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 1:18'>1:18</a> <b>eyes.</b> These may picture God’s omniscience, i.e., perfect knowledge, given to these angelic servants so that they can act in judgment unerringly. God does nothing by blind impulse. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:20'>1:20</a> <b>spirit.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Ezekiel 1:12'>1:12</a> .</i> <a ref='Ezekiel 1:24'>1:24</a> <b>sound of many waters.</b> This imagery could have in mind a thunderous rush of heavy rain or the washing of surf on rocks (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 43:2'>43:2</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 1:15'>Rev 1:15</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:2'>14:2</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:6'>19:6</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 1:25'>1:25</a> <b>sound.</b> No doubt this is the “sound of the Almighty” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:24'>24</a> ), since God’s throne (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:25'>25</a> ) was “over their heads.” <a ref='Ezekiel 1:26'>1:26</a> <b>a throne.</b> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 103:19'>Ps 103:19</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 4:2–8'>Rev 4:2–8</a> . <b>a man.</b> The Godhead appears in the likeness of humanity, though God is a spirit ( <a ref='John 4:24'>Jn 4:24</a> ). The Messiah, God incarnate, is the representative of the “fullness of Deity” ( <a ref='Colossians 2:9'>Col 2:9</a> ), so this can be a prelude to the incarnation of Messiah in His character as Savior and Judge (cf. <a ref='Revelation 19:11–16'>Rev 19:11–16</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 1:28'>1:28</a> <b>the glory of Yahweh.</b> That glory shines fully in the person of Jesus Christ (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:6'>2Co 4:6</a> ), which is a constant theme in Ezekiel. <b>fell on my face.</b> John, in <a ref='Revelation 1:17'>Rev 1:17</a> , had the same reaction (“fell at His feet”) to seeing the glory of Yahweh. <a ref='Ezekiel 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>Son of man.</b> A term used over 90 times by Ezekiel to indicate his humanness. <a ref='Ezekiel 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>the Spirit entered me.</b> What God commands a servant to do (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 2:1'>1</a> ), He gives power to fulfill by His Spirit (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:14'>3:14</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 4:6'>Zec 4:6</a> ). This pictures the selective empowering by the Holy Spirit to enable an individual for special service to Yahweh, which occurred frequently in the OT. For examples see <a ref='Ezekiel 11:5'>11:5</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 37:1'>37:1</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 24:2'>Nu 24:2</a> ; <a ref='Judges 3:10'>Jdg 3:10</a> ; <a ref='Judges 6:34'>6:34</a> ; <a ref='Judges 11:29'>11:29</a> ; <a ref='Judges 13:25'>13:25</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 10:10'>1Sa 10:10</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 16:13–14'>16:13–14</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 19:20'>19:20</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 15:1'>2Chr 15:1</a> ; <a ref='Luke 4:18'>Lk 4:18</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 2:5'>2:5</a> The people cannot plead ignorance. <a ref='Ezekiel 2:6'>2:6</a> <b>thistles and briers … scorpions.</b> Cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:7'>3:7</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 3:9'>9</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 22:29'>22:29</a> . These are figures of speech God used to describe the people of Judah, whose obstinate rejection of His Word was like the barbs of thorns and stings of scorpions to Ezekiel. The wicked were often so called (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 23:6'>2Sa 23:6</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:2'>SS 2:2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 9:18'>Is 9:18</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 2:8'>2:8</a> <b>Open your mouth and eat.</b> Ezekiel was to obey the command, not literally eating a scroll (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 2:9–10'>9–10</a> ), but in a spiritual sense by receiving God’s message so that it became an inward passion. Cf. also <a ref='Ezekiel 3:1–3'>3:1–3</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 3:10'>10</a> and <a ref='Jeremiah 15:16'>Jer 15:16</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 2:10'>2:10</a> <b>written on the front and back.</b> Scrolls were normally written on one side only, but this judgment message was so full it required all the available space (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 5:3'>Zec 5:3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 5:1'>Rev 5:1</a> ) to chronicle the suffering and sorrow that sin had brought, as recorded in chaps. <a ref='Eze 2-32'>2–32</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 3:1–3'>3:1–3</a> <b>eat this scroll … Then I ate.</b> God’s messenger must first internalize God’s truth for himself, then preach it. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:3'>3:3</a> <b>as honey.</b> Even though the message was judgment on Israel, the scroll was sweet because it was God’s Word (cf. <a ref='Psalms 19:10'>Pss 19:10</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 119:103'>119:103</a> ) and because it vindicated God in holiness, righteousness, glory, and faithfulness, in which Jeremiah also delighted ( <a ref='Jeremiah 15:16'>Jer 15:16</a> ). Bitterness also was experienced by the prophet ( <a ref='Ezekiel 3:14'>3:14</a> ) in this message of judgment confronting Judah’s rebellion (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:9'>9</a> ). The apostle John records a similar bittersweet experience with the Word of God in <a ref='Revelation 10:9–10'>Rev 10:9–10</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 3:7'>3:7</a> Cf. <a ref='John 15:20'>Jn 15:20</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 3:8–9'>3:8–9</a> <b>I have made your face … strong.</b> What God commands (“Do not be afraid”) He gives sufficiency to do (“I have made”), so God will enable the prophet to live up to his name (which means “strengthened by God”). Cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 2:2'>2:2</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 3:14'>3:14</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 3:24'>24</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 41:10'>Is 41:10</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 1:8'>Jer 1:8</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 1:17'>17</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 3:9'>3:9</a> <b>rebellious.</b> It is sad to observe that the exile and affliction did not make the Jews more responsive to God; rather, they were hardened by their sufferings. God gave Ezekiel a “strength” to surpass the people and sustain his ministry as prophet to the exiles. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:12'>3:12</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 3:14'>14</a> <b>the Spirit lifted me up.</b> This is a phrase used to describe the prophet being elevated to a heavenly vision, as in the experiences of <a ref='Ezekiel 8:3'>8:3</a> and <a ref='Ezekiel 11:1'>11:1</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 3:14'>3:14</a> <b>embittered.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Ezekiel 3:3'>3:3</a> .</i> <a ref='Ezekiel 3:15'>3:15</a> <b>the exiles.</b> Tel-abib was the main city for the Jewish captives, who may have included some of the 10 tribes taken long before in the conquering of the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 BC, as <a ref='2 Kings 17:6'>2Ki 17:6</a> may indicate (“Habor” is the same river as Chebar). <b>sat there seven days.</b> Ezekiel sat with the sorrowing people for 7 days, the usual period for manifesting deep grief (cf. <a ref='Job 2:13'>Job 2:13</a> ). He identified with them in their suffering (cf. <a ref='Psalms 137:1'>Ps 137:1</a> ), thus trying to win their trust when he spoke God’s Word. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:17'>3:17</a> <b>a watchman.</b> This role was spiritually analogous to the role of watchmen on a city wall, vigilant to spot the approach of an enemy and warn the residents to muster a defense. The prophet gave timely warnings of approaching judgment. The work of a watchman is vividly set forth in <a ref='2 Samuel 18:24–27'>2Sa 18:24–27</a> and <a ref='2 Kings 9:17–20'>2Ki 9:17–20</a> . <i>See notes on <a ref='Ezekiel 33:1–20'>33:1–20</a> .</i> <a ref='Ezekiel 3:18–21'>3:18–21</a> Cf. chap. <a ref='Eze 18'>18</a> , and <i>see notes there</i> . <a ref='Ezekiel 3:18'>3:18</a> <b>the wicked … him … his.</b> The emphasis of singular pronouns was on individuals. The ministries of Habakkuk ( <a ref='Habakkuk 2:1'>2:1</a> ), Jeremiah ( <a ref='Jeremiah 6:17'>6:17</a> ), and Isaiah ( <a ref='Isaiah 56:10'>56:10</a> ) were more national than individual. Ezekiel’s ministry was more personal, focused on individual responsibility to trust and obey God. Disobedience or obedience to God’s messages was a matter of life or death; <a ref='Ezekiel 18:1–20'>Eze 18:1–20</a> is particularly devoted to this emphasis. <b>do not warn … die.</b> Men are not to assume that ignorance, even owing to the negligence of preachers, will be any excuse to save them from divine punishment. Cf. <a ref='Romans 2:12'>Ro 2:12</a> . <b>that he may live.</b> This refers to physical death, not eternal damnation, though that would be a consequence for many. In the Pentateuch, God had commanded death for many violations of His law and warned that it could be a consequence of any kind of consistent sin (cf. <a ref='Joshua 1:16–18'>Jos 1:16–18</a> ). The people of Israel had long abandoned that severe standard of purification, so God took execution back into His own hands, as in the destruction of Israel, Judah, and Jerusalem. On the other hand, God had also promised special protection and life to the obedient. Cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 18:9–32'>18:9–32</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 33:11–16'>33:11–16</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 4:4'>Pr 4:4</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 7:2'>7:2</a> ; <a ref='Amos 5:4'>Am 5:4</a> , <a ref='Amos 5:6'>6</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 3:18'>3:18</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 3:20'>20</a> <b>his blood I will require.</b> Though each sinner is responsible for his own sin (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 18:1–20'>18:1–20</a> ), the prophet who is negligent in his duty to proclaim the warning message becomes, in God’s sight, a manslayer when God takes that person’s life. The responsibility of the prophet is serious (cf. <a ref='James 3:1'>Jas 3:1</a> ), and he is responsible for that person’s death in the sense of <a ref='Genesis 9:5'>Ge 9:5</a> . The apostle Paul had this passage (and <a ref='Ezekiel 33:6'>Eze 33:6</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 33:8'>8</a> ) in view in <a ref='Acts 18:6'>Ac 18:6</a> and <a ref='Acts 20:26'>20:26</a> . Even for preachers today, there is such a warning in <a ref='Hebrews 13:17'>Heb 13:17</a> . Certainly the consequence for such unfaithfulness on the preacher’s part includes divine chastening and loss of eternal reward (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 4:1–5'>1Co 4:1–5</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 3:20'>3:20</a> <b>a righteous man.</b> Here is a person who was obeying God by doing what was right, but fell into sin and God took his life in chastisement. The “stumbling block” was a stone of judgment that kills. <a ref='Psalms 119:165'>Ps 119:165</a> says: “Those who love Your law have much peace, and nothing causes them to stumble.” The crushing stone always falls on the disobedient. <a ref='Hebrews 12:9'>Hebrews 12:9</a> says it is better to obey and “live.” Cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 11:30'>1Co 11:30</a> ; <a ref='James 1:21'>Jas 1:21</a> ; <a ref='1 John 5:16'>1Jn 5:16</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 3:21'>3:21</a> <b>delivered yourself.</b> The prophet had done his duty. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:23'>3:23</a> <b>the glory of Yahweh.</b> See Introduction: Historical and Theological Themes . Ezekiel’s Sign Experiences (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 24:24'>Eze 24:24</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 24:27'>27</a> ) 1. Ezekiel was housebound, tied up, and mute ( <a ref='Ezekiel 3:23–27'>3:23–27</a> ). 2. Ezekiel used a brick and an iron plate as illustrations in his preaching ( <a ref='Ezekiel 4:1–3'>4:1–3</a> ). 3. Ezekiel had to lie on his left side for 390 days and his right side for 40 days ( <a ref='Ezekiel 4:4–8'>4:4–8</a> ). 4. Ezekiel had to eat in an unclean manner ( <a ref='Ezekiel 4:9–17'>4:9–17</a> ). 5. Ezekiel had to shave his head and beard ( <a ref='Ezekiel 5:1–4'>5:1–4</a> ). 6. Ezekiel had to pack his bags and dig through the wall of Jerusalem ( <a ref='Ezekiel 12:1–14'>12:1–14</a> ). 7. Ezekiel had to eat his bread with trembling and drink water with quivering ( <a ref='Ezekiel 12:17–20'>12:17–20</a> ). 8. Ezekiel brandished a sharp sword and struck his hands together ( <a ref='Ezekiel 21:8–17'>21:8–17</a> ). 9. Ezekiel portrayed Israel in the smelting furnace ( <a ref='Ezekiel 22:17–22'>22:17–22</a> ). 10. Ezekiel had to cook a pot of stew ( <a ref='Ezekiel 24:1–14'>24:1–14</a> ). 11. Ezekiel could not mourn at the death of his wife ( <a ref='Ezekiel 24:15–24'>24:15–24</a> ). 12. Ezekiel was mute for a season ( <a ref='Ezekiel 24:25–27'>24:25–27</a> ). 13. Ezekiel put two sticks together and they became one ( <a ref='Ezekiel 37:15–28'>37:15–28</a> ). Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Ezekiel 3:24'>3:24</a> <b>shut yourself up in your house.</b> He was to fulfill much of his ministry at home ( <a ref='Ezekiel 8:1'>8:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 12:1–7'>12:1–7</a> ), thereby limiting it to those who came to hear him there. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:25'>3:25</a> <b>they will put ropes on you.</b> These were not literal, but spiritual. On one hand, they could be the inner ropes of depressing influence which the rebellious Jews exerted on his spirit. Their perversity, like ropes, would repress his freedom in preaching. More likely, they imply the restraint that God placed on him by supernatural power, so that he could only go and speak where and when God chose (cf. vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:26–27'>26–27</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 3:26–27'>3:26–27</a> <b>you will be mute.</b> He was not to speak primarily, but to act out God’s message. The prohibition was only partial, for on any occasion (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:27'>27</a> ) when God did open his mouth, as He often did in chaps. <a ref='Eze 5-7'>5–7</a> , he was to speak ( <a ref='Ezekiel 3:22'>3:22</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 11:25'>11:25</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 12:10'>12:10</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 12:19'>19</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 12:23'>23</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 12:28'>28</a> ). The end of such intermittent dumbness with regard to his own people closely synchronized with Ezekiel’s receiving a refugee’s report of Jerusalem’s fall ( <a ref='Ezekiel 24:25–27'>24:25–27</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 33:21–22'>33:21–22</a> ). He also spoke with regard to judgments on other nations (chaps. <a ref='Eze 25-32'>25–32</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 4:1–7:27'>4:1—7:27</a> Here is the first series of prophecies given over a year’s time, of Jerusalem’s conquest by the Babylonians in 586 BC. <a ref='Ezekiel 4:1–3'>4:1–3</a> <b>inscribe … Jerusalem.</b> Ezekiel’s object lesson was to use a soft tile to create a miniature city layout of Jerusalem with walls and siege objects to illustrate Babylon’s final coming siege of Jerusalem (588–586 BC). <a ref='Ezekiel 4:4–6'>4:4–6</a> <b>lie … on your left side … right side.</b> Lying on his side, likely facing north, illustrated God’s applying judgment to Israel, and facing south pointed to judgment on Judah. It is not necessary to assume that Ezekiel was in the prone position all the time. It was doubtless part of each day, as his need for preparing food (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 4:9'>9</a> ) indicates. <a ref='Ezekiel 4:4'>4:4</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 4:6'>6</a> <b>you shall bear their iniquity.</b> Ezekiel’s action was not to represent the time of Israel’s sinning, but the time of its punishment. <a ref='Ezekiel 4:5'>4:5</a> <b>390.</b> Each day symbolized a year (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 4:6'>6</a> ). Israel in the north was accountable during this span of time whose beginning and end are uncertain. <a ref='Ezekiel 4:6'>4:6</a> <b>forty.</b> Judah was also guilty, but the 40 cannot represent less guilt (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 23:11'>23:11</a> ). It may extend the time beyond the 390 to 430, or they may run concurrently, but the exact timing is uncertain. <a ref='Ezekiel 4:7'>4:7</a> <b>arm bared.</b> A symbol for being ready for action, as a soldier would do (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 52:10'>Is 52:10</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 4:8'>4:8</a> <b>I will set ropes upon you.</b> This was to symbolize the impossibility of the Jews being able to shake off their punishment. <a ref='Ezekiel 4:9–13'>4:9–13</a> <b>make … bread.</b> Scarcity of food in the 18-month siege especially made necessary the mixing of all kinds of grain for bread. The “twenty shekels” would be about 8 ounces, while “the sixth part of a hin” would be less than a quart. There would be minimums for daily rations. It must be noted that the command of v. <a ref='Ezekiel 4:12'>12</a> regarding “human dung” relates only to the fuel used to prepare the food. Bread was baked on hot stones (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 19:6'>1Ki 19:6</a> ) heated by human waste because no other fuel was available. This was repulsive and polluting (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:12–14'>Dt 23:12–14</a> ) and Yahweh calls it “bread unclean” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 4:13'>13</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 4:14–15'>4:14–15</a> <b>never been defiled.</b> Ezekiel, like Daniel, had convictions to be undefiled even in his food (cf. <a ref='Daniel 1:8'>Da 1:8</a> and <i>see note there</i> ). God permitted fuel of dried cow chips for cooking his food in gracious deference to His spokesman’s sensitivity (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 44:31'>44:31</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 4:16–17'>4:16–17</a> They were soon to have neither bread nor water in any amount, and they were to grieve over the famine and their iniquity (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 26:21–26'>Lv 26:21–26</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 5:1–4'>5:1–4</a> <b>a barber’s razor.</b> The sign in shaving his hair illustrated the severe humiliation to come at the hand of enemies, emphasizing calamities to three segments of Jerusalem due to the Babylonian conquest. Some were punished by fire, i.e., plague and famine (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 5:12'>12</a> ), others died by the enemy’s sword, and some were dispersed and pursued by death (cf. v. <a ref='Ezekiel 5:12'>12</a> ). A small part of his hair clinging to his garment (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 5:3'>3</a> ) depicted a remaining remnant, some of whom were subject to further calamity (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 5:4'>4</a> ; cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 6:8'>6:8</a> ; <a ref='Je 41-44'>Jer 41–44</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 5:5'>5:5</a> <b>Jerusalem.</b> Here the great city alone was not meant, but was used as a representative of the whole land which, despite its strategic opportunity and responsibility, rejected God (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 5:6–7'>6–7</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 5:7'>5:7</a> Instead of being a witness to the heathen nations, Israel had exceeded them in idolatrous practices. The nations maintained their familiar idols, while Israel defected from their true and living God. God’s people were worse than the pagans in proportion to spiritual knowledge and privileges. The judgments of God are always relative to light and privilege granted. Since Ezekiel’s people were unique in their disobedience, they were to be outstanding in their punishment. <a ref='Ezekiel 5:8–10'>5:8–10</a> The book of Lamentations reveals how literally these promises were realized when parents ate their children and sons ate their fathers in the times of starvation. Down through the centuries had come the threats of <a ref='Leviticus 26:29'>Lv 26:29</a> and <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:53'>Dt 28:53</a> , taken up by Jeremiah ( <a ref='Jeremiah 19:9'>Jer 19:9</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 2:22'>Lam 2:22</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 4:10'>4:10</a> ; cf. <a ref='Isaiah 9:20'>Is 9:20</a> ), and sealed in the life of the disobedient nation. Even the remnant would be scattered and suffer. <a ref='Ezekiel 5:11'>5:11</a> <b>as I live.</b> Here was a solemn oath pledging the very existence of God for the fulfillment of the prophecy. It is found 16 times in this book. Their greatest sin was defiling the sanctuary, showing the height of their wickedness. <a ref='Ezekiel 5:12'>5:12</a> The 4 well-known judgments (cf. vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 5:2–4'>2–4</a> ) of plague, famine, sword, and scattering were their judgment. They had no place to offer atoning blood, thus bearing their sins without relief. <a ref='Ezekiel 5:13–15'>5:13–15</a> Ezekiel’s purpose was to impress on Israel’s conscience God’s intense hatred of idolatry and apostasy. “Anger” and “wrath” are repeated several times. <a ref='Ezekiel 5:16'>5:16</a> <b>deadly arrows of famine.</b> The evil arrows included hail, rain, mice, locusts, and mildew (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:23–24'>Dt 32:23–24</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 5:17'>5:17</a> <b>I, Yahweh, have spoken.</b> Cf. vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 5:13'>13</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 5:15'>15</a> for the same expression, which was God’s personal signature on their doom. <a ref='Ezekiel 6:3'>6:3</a> <b>says Yahweh Yahweh to the mountains.</b> God had the prophet do this because the people worshiped at idol altars in the “high places” (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 26:30–33'>Lv 26:30–33</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 65:7'>Is 65:7</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 3:6'>Jer 3:6</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 4:13'>Hos 4:13</a> ; <a ref='Micah 6:1–2'>Mic 6:1–2</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 6:7'>6:7</a> <b>you will know that I am Yahweh.</b> This clause recurs in vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 6:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 6:13–14'>13–14</a> and 60 times elsewhere in the book. It shows that the essential reason for judgment is the violation of the character of God. This is repeatedly acknowledged in <a ref='Le 18-26'>Lv 18–26</a> , where the motive for all obedience to God’s law is the fact that He is the Lord God. <a ref='Ezekiel 6:8–10'>6:8–10</a> The mass of people was rejected, but grace and mercy were given to a godly group in the nation. There never has been nor ever will be a complete end to Israel. The doctrine of the remnant can be studied in <a ref='Isaiah 1:9'>Is 1:9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 10:20'>10:20</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 43:5'>Jer 43:5</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 2:7'>Zep 2:7</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 3:13'>3:13</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 10:9'>Zec 10:9</a> ; <a ref='Romans 9:6–13'>Ro 9:6–13</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:5'>11:5</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 6:14'>6:14</a> <b>Diblah.</b> A reference to Diblathaim, a city on the eastern edge of Moab ( <a ref='Numbers 33:46'>Nu 33:46</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 48:22'>Jer 48:22</a> ), near the desert east and south of the Dead Sea. <a ref='Ezekiel 7:1–9'>7:1–9</a> This lament declared that the entire land of Israel was ripe for judgment.

Their “silver and … gold” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 7:19'>19</a> ) and their “ornaments” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 7:20'>20</a> ) were as useless as the idols they made with them. <a ref='Ezekiel 7:22'>7:22</a> <b>My secret place.</b> The Holy of Holies in the temple will be desecrated by pagans, that place where only once a year the High Priest could enter to make atonement in God’s presence. <a ref='Ezekiel 7:23'>7:23</a> <b>Make the chain.</b> Ezekiel is to perform another emblematic act of captivity (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 27:2'>Jer 27:2</a> ; <a ref='Nahum 3:10'>Na 3:10</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 7:24'>7:24</a> <b>the</b> most <b>evil of the nations.</b> Babylonian pagans. <a ref='Ezekiel 7:27'>7:27</a> <b>According to their way.</b> Cf. <a ref='Genesis 18:25'>Ge 18:25</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 8:1'>8:1</a> <b>the sixth year.</b> 592 BC (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:2'>1:2</a> ) in Aug./Sep., a year and two months after the first vision ( <a ref='Ezekiel 1:1'>1:1</a> ). <b>the hand of Yahweh.</b> This ushered the prophet into a series of visions (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 8:3'>3</a> ) stretching to the end of chap. <a ref='Eze 11'>11</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 8:2'>8:2</a> <b>a likeness.</b> He saw the glory of Yahweh (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 8:4'>4</a> ) as in <a ref='Ezekiel 1:26–28'>1:26–28</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 8:3'>8:3</a> <b>the visions of God.</b> <a ref='Eze 8-11'>Ezekiel 8–11</a> deals with details conveyed only to Ezekiel in visions. Ezekiel’s trip to Jerusalem was in spirit only, while his body physically remained in his house. In visions, he went to Jerusalem, and in visions he returned to Babylon ( <a ref='Ezekiel 11:24'>11:24</a> ). After God finished the visions, Ezekiel told his home audience what he had seen. The visions are not a description of deeds done in the past in Israel, but a survey of Israel’s current condition, as they existed at that very time. <b>the seat … figure of jealousy.</b> God represents to Ezekiel the image of an idol (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:16'>Dt 4:16</a> ) in the entrance to the inner court of the temple. It is called “the figure of jealousy” because it provoked Yahweh to jealousy ( <a ref='Ezekiel 5:13'>5:13</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 16:38'>16:38</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 36:6'>36:6</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 38:19'>38:19</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 20:5'>Ex 20:5</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 8:4'>8:4</a> <b>the glory of … God.</b> God was also there in glory, but was ignored while the people worshiped the idol (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 8:6'>6</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 8:6'>8:6</a> <b>so that I would be far.</b> Sin would expel the people from their land and God from His sanctuary. <a ref='Ezekiel 8:7–12'>8:7–12</a> This section describes “great abominations” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 8:6'>6</a> ) of idolatry, namely a secret cult of idolatrous elders. <a ref='Ezekiel 8:8'>8:8</a> <b>dug through the wall … an entrance.</b> This indicates the clandestine (cf. v. <a ref='Ezekiel 8:12'>12</a> ) secrecy of these idolaters, practicing their cult in hiding. <a ref='Ezekiel 8:10'>8:10</a> <b>carved on the wall.</b> The temple’s walls are ugly with graffiti featuring creatures linked with Egyptian animal cults (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:23'>Ro 1:23</a> ) and other idols. Leaders of Israel, who should be worshiping the God of the temple, are offering incense to them (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 8:11'>11</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 8:11'>8:11</a> <b>seventy elders.</b> Obviously not the Sanhedrin, since it was not formed until after the restoration from Babylon, though the pattern had been suggested much earlier (cf. <a ref='Exodus 24:9–10'>Ex 24:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 11:16'>Nu 11:16</a> ). These men were appointed to guard against idolatry! <b>Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan.</b> If he was the son of the Shaphan who read God’s Word to Josiah ( <a ref='2 Kings 22:8–11'>2Ki 22:8–11</a> ), we have some concept of the depth of sin to which the leaders had fallen. He is not to be confused with the man in <a ref='Ezekiel 11:1'>11:1</a> , who had a different father. <a ref='Ezekiel 8:14'>8:14</a> <b>weeping for Tammuz.</b> Yet a greater abomination than the secret cult was Israel’s engaging in the Babylonian worship of Tammuz or Dumuzi (Duzu), beloved of Ishtar, the god of spring vegetation. Vegetation burned in the summer, died in the winter, and came to life in the spring. The women mourned over the god’s demise in July and longed for his revival. The fourth month of the Hebrew calendar still bears the name Tammuz. With the worship of this idol were connected the basest immoralities. <a ref='Ezekiel 8:16'>8:16</a> <b>prostrating … toward the sun.</b> In the most sacred inner court where only priests could go ( <a ref='Joel 2:17'>Joel 2:17</a> ), there was the crowning insult to God. Twenty-five men were worshiping the sun as an idol (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:19'>Dt 4:19</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 23:5'>2Ki 23:5</a> , <a ref='2 Kings 23:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='Job 31:26'>Job 31:26</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 44:17'>Jer 44:17</a> ). These 25 represent the 24 orders of priests plus the High Priest. <a ref='Ezekiel 8:17'>8:17</a> <b>sending forth the twig to their nose.</b> The meaning is uncertain, but it seems to have been some act of contempt toward God. The Greek OT translators rendered it, “they are as mockers.” <a ref='Ezekiel 8:18'>8:18</a> <b>I … will do</b> this <b>in wrath.</b> God must judge intensely due to such horrible sins (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 24:9–10'>24:9–10</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 9:1'>9:1</a> <b>executioners of the city.</b> God summoned His servant angels to carry out His judgments. These angelic executioners (cf. <a ref='Daniel 4:13'>Da 4:13</a> , <a ref='Daniel 4:17'>17</a> , <a ref='Daniel 4:23'>23</a> ) came equipped with weapons of destruction. <a ref='Ezekiel 9:2'>9:2</a> <b>six men.</b> Angels can appear like men when ministering on earth (cf. <a ref='Genesis 18:1'>Ge 18:1</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:20–23'>Da 9:20–23</a> ). <b>a certain man.</b> He was superior to the others. Linen indicates high rank (cf. <a ref='Daniel 10:5'>Da 10:5</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 12:6'>12:6</a> ). Perhaps this was the angel of Yahweh, the preincarnate Christ ( <i>see note on <a ref='Exodus 3:2'>Ex 3:2</a></i> ). He had all the instruments of an oriental scribe to carry out His task (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 9:4'>4</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 9:11'>11</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 9:3'>9:3</a> <b>the glory … went up.</b> The glory of God departs before the destruction of the city and temple. The gradual departure of God from His temple is depicted in stages: the glory resides in the temple’s Most Holy Place, between the wings of the cherubs on each side of the ark of the covenant over the mercy seat, then leaves to the front door ( <a ref='Ezekiel 9:3'>9:3</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 10:4'>10:4</a> ), later to the east gate by the outer wall ( <a ref='Ezekiel 10:18–19'>10:18–19</a> ), and finally to the Mt. of Olives to the east, having fully departed ( <a ref='Ezekiel 11:22–23'>11:22–23</a> ). The glory will return in the future kingdom of Messiah ( <a ref='Ezekiel 43:2–7'>43:2–7</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 9:4'>9:4</a> <b>a mark on the foreheads.</b> Since God’s departure removed all protection and gave the people over to destruction, it was necessary for the angelic scribe (angel of Yahweh) to mark for God’s preservation the righteous who had been faithful to Him. Those left unmarked were subject to death in Babylon’s siege (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 9:5'>5</a> ). The mark was the indication of God’s elect, identified personally by the preincarnate Christ. He was marking the elect (cf. <a ref='Exodus 12:7'>Ex 12:7</a> ). <a ref='Malachi 3:16–18'>Malachi 3:16–18</a> indicates a similar idea. Cf. <a ref='Revelation 7:3'>Rev 7:3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 9:4'>9:4</a> . The marked ones were penitent and were identified for protection. Here was a respite of grace for the remnant. The rest were to be killed (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 9:5–7'>5–7</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 9:8'>9:8</a> <b>Are You destroying…?</b> Ezekiel is fearfully aroused in prayer because the judgment on Jerusalem and Israel is so vast. God replies that pervasive sin demands thorough judgment (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 9:9–10'>9–10</a> ), yet comforts him by the report that the faithful had been marked to be spared (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 9:11'>11</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Romans 11:1–2'>Ro 11:1–2</a> , <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>25–27</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 10:1'>10:1</a> <b>a throne.</b> It rises above God’s angelic servants, the same 4 as in chap. <a ref='Eze 1'>1</a> ( <a ref='Ezekiel 10:20'>10:20</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 10:22'>22</a> ), and is the throne of <a ref='Ezekiel 1:26–28'>1:26–28</a> on which God sits (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 10:20'>10:20</a> ). From it, He directs the operation of His war machine (“wheels,” <i>see notes on <a ref='Ezekiel 1:15–16'>1:15–16</a></i> ) on Jerusalem (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 10:2'>2</a> ). The throne is like a sapphire shining forth representing God’s glory and holiness ( <a ref='Ezekiel 11:22'>11:22</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 10:2'>10:2</a> <b>fill … with coals.</b> God specifies that the marking angel ( <a ref='Ezekiel 9:2'>9:2</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 9:11'>11</a> ) reach into the war machine and fill his hands with fiery coals in the presence of the angels of chap. <a ref='Eze 1'>1</a> . These coals picture the fires of judgment which God’s angels are to “scatter” on Jerusalem. In <a ref='Is 6'>Is 6</a> , “a coal” was used for the purification of the prophet; here coals were for the destruction of the wicked (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 12:29'>Heb 12:29</a> ). Fire did destroy Jerusalem in 586 BC. <a ref='Ezekiel 10:3'>10:3</a> <b>cherubim.</b> These were different from the cherubim of chap. <a ref='Eze 1'>1</a> and here in v. <a ref='Ezekiel 10:4'>4</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 10:4'>10:4</a> This verse explains how the “cloud” of v. <a ref='Ezekiel 10:3'>3</a> “filled … the court.” It repeats what is first described in <a ref='Ezekiel 9:3'>9:3</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 10:6–7'>10:6–7</a> These verses picked up the action of the angelic scribe from v. <a ref='Ezekiel 10:2'>2</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 10:7'>10:7</a> <b>cherub … put</b> it <b>into the hands.</b> One of the 4 cherubim of <a ref='Ezekiel 1:5'>1:5ff.</a> and v. <a ref='Ezekiel 10:1'>1</a> puts the fiery coals into the marking angel’s hand. <a ref='Ezekiel 10:9–17'>10:9–17</a> <b>wheels beside the cherubim.</b> This whole section is similar to <a ref='Ezekiel 1:4–21'>1:4–21</a> . Four wheels on God’s chariot mingled with the 4 angels (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:15–21'>1:15–21</a> ) coordinated with one another in precision, and each with a different one of the cherubim. All looked so much alike that it was as if one wheel blended entirely with another (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:10'>10</a> ). As their appearance was so unified, their action was in unison, and instant (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:11'>11</a> ). The cherubim had bodies like men, and their chariot wheels were full of eyes, denoting full perception both to see the sinners and their fitting judgment. The color tarshish, or beryl, is a sparkling yellow or gold. <a ref='Ezekiel 10:14'>10:14</a> <b>the face of a cherub.</b> This description of one cherub in <a ref='Ezekiel 1:10'>1:10</a> indicates this was the face of an ox. <a ref='Ezekiel 10:15'>10:15</a> <b>rose up.</b> They were all ready to move in unison (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 10:16–17'>16–17</a> ) as the Shekinah glory of God departed (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 10:18'>18</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 10:18–19'>10:18–19</a> <b>glory … departed.</b> There were several stages: <a ref='Ezekiel 9:3'>9:3</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 10:1'>10:1</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 10:3–4'>3–4</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 10:18–19'>10:18–19</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 11:22–23'>11:22–23</a> . There was thus written over the entire structure, as well as Israel’s spiritual life, “Ichabod” (the glory has departed). Cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 4:21'>1Sa 4:21</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 10:18–19'>10:18–19</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 11:1'>11:1</a> <b>twenty-five men.</b> Ezekiel, though at the temple only in the vision (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 8:3'>8:3</a> , and <i>see note there</i> ), saw because God, who was everywhere present and all-knowing, impressed specific details on him in the vision. The wicked leaders (cf. v. <a ref='Ezekiel 11:2'>2</a> ) were part of God’s reason for the judgment (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 11:8'>8</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 11:10'>10</a> ). Ezekiel was taken in spirit to the very place which the glory of God had left in <a ref='Ezekiel 10:19'>10:19</a> and was given a vision of “twenty-five men,” who represented not priests, but influential leaders among the people who gave fatal advice to the people (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 11:2'>2</a> ). <b>Jaazaniah son of Azzur.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Ezekiel 8:11'>8:11</a> .</i> <a ref='Ezekiel 11:3'>11:3</a> <b>pot … flesh.</b> Though this is obscure, it may be that the bad advice these leaders were giving was that the people should not be engaged in business as usual, “to build houses” or to take care of their comfort and futures, when they were about to be cooked like flesh in a pot over a blazing fire. The idea must have been that the people should get ready for battle, and be prepared to fight, not focusing on comfort, but survival. Jeremiah had told the people to surrender to the Babylonians and save their lives, rather than fight and be killed (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 27:9–17'>Jer 27:9–17</a> ). These false leaders, like the prophets and priests whom Jeremiah confronted for telling the people not to submit, scorned Jeremiah’s words from God and would pay for it (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 11:4'>4</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 24:1–14'>24:1–14</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 11:6'>11:6</a> <b>multiplied your slain.</b> Leaders who misled Israel by inciting false expectations of a victorious defense, rather than peaceful surrender, were responsible for the deadly results. Many people died in resisting Babylon. <a ref='Ezekiel 11:7'>11:7</a> <b>I will bring you out.</b> The false leaders thought that unless they fought, they would all be in a boiling pot, i.e., the city. But here Yahweh promised that some would be delivered from the city, only to die on Israel’s border in the wilderness (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 11:8–11'>8–11</a> ). This was literally fulfilled at Riblah (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 25:18–21'>2Ki 25:18–21</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 52:24–27'>Jer 52:24–27</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 11:13'>11:13</a> <b>Pelatiah … died.</b> The death of one leader from v. <a ref='Ezekiel 11:1'>1</a> was a sign that God would indeed carry out His word. Apparently this leader did die suddenly at the time Ezekiel was shown the vision, so that the prophet feared that this death meant death for all Israelites ( <a ref='Ezekiel 9:8'>9:8</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 11:14–15'>11:14–15</a> Ezekiel was told he had a new family, not the priests at Jerusalem to whom he was tied by blood, but his fellow exiles in Babylon, identified as those who were treated as outcasts. The priesthood was about to be ended, and he was to have a new family. <a ref='Ezekiel 11:15'>11:15</a> <b>Go far from.</b> The contemptuous words of those still left in Jerusalem at the carrying away of Jeconiah and the exiles indicated that they felt smugly secure and believed the land was their possession. <a ref='Ezekiel 11:16'>11:16</a> <b>sanctuary.</b> God was to be the protection and provision for those who had been scattered through all the 70 years until they were restored. The exiles may have cast off the Jews, but God had not ( <a ref='Isaiah 8:14'>Is 8:14</a> ). This holds true for the future restoration of the Jews (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 11:17–18'>17–18</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 11:19–20'>11:19–20</a> <b>a new spirit.</b> God pledged not only to restore Ezekiel’s people to their ancient land, but to bring the New Covenant with its blessings.

God, who supernaturally showed him a vision in Jerusalem, caused his sense of awareness to return to Chaldea, thus ending the vision state. Once the vision was completed, Ezekiel was able to tell his exiled countrymen what God had shown him (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 11:25'>25</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 12:2'>12:2</a> <b>rebellious house.</b> The message of Ezekiel was addressed to his fellow exiles who were as hardened as those still in Jerusalem.

His countrymen carried out such baggage when they went into captivity, or sought to escape during Babylon’s takeover of Jerusalem (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 12:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 12:11'>11</a> ). Some attempting to escape were caught as in a net, like King Zedekiah who was overtaken, blinded, and forced into exile (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 12:12–13'>12–13</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 24:18–25:7'>2Ki 24:18—25:7</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 39:4–7'>Jer 39:4–7</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 52:1–11'>52:1–11</a> ). Verse <a ref='Ezekiel 12:7'>7</a> indicates that Ezekiel actually did what he was told. <a ref='Ezekiel 12:5'>12:5</a> This section depicts those in desperation trying to escape from their sun-dried brick homes. <a ref='Ezekiel 12:6'>12:6</a> <b>cover your face.</b> This was to avoid recognition. <a ref='Ezekiel 12:10–13'>12:10–13</a> <b>the prince.</b> This is a reference to King Zedekiah, who was always referred to by Ezekiel as prince, never king. Jehoiachin was regarded as the true king (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 17:13'>17:13</a> ), because the Babylonians never deposed him formally. All the house of Israel, however, shared the calamity to fall on Zedekiah. How literally these prophecies were fulfilled can be seen from the account in <a ref='2 Kings 25:1–7'>2Ki 25:1–7</a> . The “net” and “snare” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 12:13'>13</a> ) were the Babylonian army. He was taken captive to Babylon, but he never saw it because his eyes had been put out at Riblah. <a ref='Ezekiel 12:14–16'>12:14–16</a> God’s hand was to be with the enemy as His rod of correction, with only a few left. <a ref='Ezekiel 12:22'>12:22</a> <b>this proverb.</b> Delay had given the people the false impression that the stroke of judgment would never come. In fact, a saying had become popular, no doubt developed by false prophets who caused the people to reject Ezekiel’s visions and prophecies (cf. v. <a ref='Ezekiel 12:27'>27</a> ) and gave “worthless vision or flattering divination” (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 12:23–24'>23–24</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 12:25'>12:25</a> <b>in your days.</b> The prophet is explicit about the present time for fulfillment, i.e., in their lifetime. <a ref='Ezekiel 13:2'>13:2</a> <b>against the prophets.</b> False prophets had long flourished in Judah and had been transported to Babylon as well. Here God directs Ezekiel to indict those false prophets for futile assurances of peace (as <a ref='Je 23'>Jer 23</a> ) in vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 13:1–16'>1–16</a> . Then His attention turns to lying prophetesses in vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 13:17–23'>17–23</a> . The test of a prophet is found in <a ref='Deuteronomy 13:1–5'>Dt 13:1–5</a> and <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:21–22'>18:21–22</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 13:2–3'>13:2–3</a> <b>heart … spirit.</b> Spurious spokesmen prophesy subjectively out of their minds while claiming to have revelation and authority from Yahweh (cf. v. <a ref='Ezekiel 13:7'>7</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 13:4'>13:4</a> <b>like foxes.</b> False prophets did not do anything helpful. Rather, like foxes, they were mischievous and destructive. <a ref='Ezekiel 13:5'>13:5</a> <b>build the wall.</b> The false prophets did nothing to shore up the spiritual defenses the people so needed in the face of judgment. The enemy had made “breaches” but the false prophets never encouraged the people to repent and return to Yahweh. Those who would were called for in <a ref='Ezekiel 22:30'>22:30</a> . The “day of Yahweh” came in 586 BC when the theocracy fell. <i>See note on <a ref='Isaiah 2:12'>Is 2:12</a> .</i> <a ref='Ezekiel 13:9'>13:9</a> A 3-fold judgment is given to the false prophets: 1) they would not be in the council of God’s people; 2) their names would be wiped from the register of Israel ( <a ref='Ezra 2:62'>Ezr 2:62</a> ); and 3) they would never return to the land (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:38'>20:38</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 13:10–11'>13:10–11</a> <b>builds a wall.</b> False prophets had lulled the people into false security. Phony “peace” promises, while sin continued on the brink of God’s judgment, was a way, so to speak, of erecting a defective “wall” and whitewashing it to make it look good. Such an unsafe “wall” was doomed to collapse (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 13:11'>11</a> ) when God would bring His storm, picturing the invaders’ assault (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 13:11'>11</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 13:11–16'>13:11–16</a> These descriptions are all images belonging to the illustration of the wall, not meant to convey real wind, flood, and hail. The Babylonians were the actual destroyers of Israel’s hypocritical false spirituality. <a ref='Ezekiel 13:17–23'>13:17–23</a> Although women are rebuked by Isaiah ( <a ref='Isaiah 3:16–4:1'>3:16—4:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 32:9–13'>32:9–13</a> ) and Amos ( <a ref='Amos 4:1–3'>4:1–3</a> ), this is the only OT text where false prophetesses are mentioned. Sorcery was practiced mainly by women. Jezebel is called a false prophetess in <a ref='Revelation 2:20'>Rev 2:20</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 13:18–19'>13:18–19</a> <b>bands … veils … handfuls of barley … bread.</b> Apparently, these sorceresses employed all these things in their divinations, hunting down souls for their advantage (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 13:20'>20</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 13:22'>13:22</a> <b>with falsehood.</b> Predators had saddened the righteous by a false message leading to calamity which involved great loss even for them (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:3–4'>21:3–4</a> ). They had encouraged the wicked to expect a bright future, and saw no need to repent to avoid death. <a ref='Ezekiel 13:23'>13:23</a> <b>I will deliver My people.</b> Certainly this was true in the restoration after the 70 years in Babylon, but will be fully true in Messiah’s kingdom. God’s true promise will bring an end to sorcery and false prophecy (cf. <a ref='Micah 3:6–7'>Mic 3:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 13:1–6'>Zec 13:1–6</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 14:1–3'>14:1–3</a> <b>elders … came.</b> These leaders came insincerely seeking God’s counsel (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 14:3'>3</a> ; cf. <a ref='Psalms 66:18'>Ps 66:18</a> ), as God reveals to the prophet, who thus saw through their facade and indicted them for determining to pursue their evil way and defy God’s will. False prophets of chap. <a ref='Eze 13'>13</a> were thriving, as the civil leaders and populace whom they represented set a welcoming climate and inclination for the delusions. <a ref='Ezekiel 14:4'>14:4</a> <b>I Yahweh will … answer.</b> They received no verbal answer, but an answer directly from Yahweh in the action of judgment. <a ref='Ezekiel 14:6'>14:6</a> <b>turn away.</b> Yahweh answered the two-faced inquiry in only one way, by a call to repent. The seekers were turned away from Him to idols (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 14:6'>6b</a> ), and He must be turned away from them (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 14:8'>8a</a> ). The guilty, including both those back at Jerusalem and the exiles tolerating the same things, were to repent, turning away from idols to God. <a ref='Ezekiel 14:8'>14:8</a> The punishment echoed the warnings of <a ref='Leviticus 20:3'>Lv 20:3</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 20:5–6'>5–6</a> and <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:27'>Dt 28:27</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 14:9'>14:9</a> <b>enticed.</b> God will deceive (entice) a false prophet only in a qualified sense. When one willfully rejects His Word, He places a resulting cloud of darkness, or permits it to continue, hiding the truth so that the person is deceived by his own obstinate self-will. This fits with the same principle as when God gives up Israel to evil statutes ( <a ref='Ezekiel 20:25–26'>20:25–26</a> ), counsel that they insist on as they spurn His Word ( <a ref='Ezekiel 20:24'>20:24</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 20:26'>26</a> ). When people refuse the truth, He lets them seek after their own inclinations and gives them over to falsehood ( <a ref='Ezekiel 20:39'>20:39</a> ). This is the wrath of abandonment noted in <a ref='Romans 1:18–32'>Ro 1:18–32</a> (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 22:20–23'>1Ki 22:20–23</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:11'>2Th 2:11</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 14:12'>14:12</a> <b>the word … came.</b> Ezekiel answered a deception that God would never judge the people of Judah, since some righteous were among them. God would honor the presence of the godly (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 14:14'>14</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 14:20'>20</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 14:13–20'>14:13–20</a> <b>My hand against.</b> God promised 4 acts in His drama of judgment (cf. summary, v. <a ref='Ezekiel 14:21'>21</a> ). In none could the 3 heroes avert tragedy as advocates. These were: 1) famine; 2) wild beasts; 3) the sword; and 4) plague. <a ref='Ezekiel 14:14–20'>14:14–20</a> <b>Noah, Daniel, and Job.</b> <a ref='Jeremiah 7:16'>Jeremiah 7:16</a> and <a ref='Jeremiah 15:1–4'>15:1–4</a> provide a close parallel to this passage. According to Jeremiah, even Moses and Samuel, well known for their power in intercessory prayer, would not prevail to deliver Jerusalem and the people. The 3 OT heroes mentioned in this section exhibited power in intercession on behalf of others (cf. <a ref='Genesis 6:18'>Ge 6:18</a> ; <a ref='Job 42:7–10'>Job 42:7–10</a> ; <a ref='Da 1-2'>Da 1–2</a> ) at strategic points in redemptive history, and even they could not deliver anyone but themselves if they were there praying earnestly. Even the presence and prayers of the godly could not stop the coming judgment. <a ref='Genesis 18:22–32'>Genesis 18:22–32</a> and <a ref='Jeremiah 5:1–4'>Jer 5:1–4</a> provide rare exceptions to the principle that one man’s righteousness is no protection for others. <a ref='Ezekiel 14:22–23'>14:22–23</a> <b>their way.</b> An ungodly Jerusalem remnant, brought as captives to join exiled Jews in Babylon, were to be very wicked. Exiles already there, repulsed by this evil, were to realize God’s justness in His severe judgment on Jerusalem. <a ref='Ezekiel 15:1–3'>15:1–3</a> <b>Then the word … came.</b> Israel, often symbolized by a vine ( <a ref='Ezekiel 17:6–10'>17:6–10</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 49:22'>Ge 49:22</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 2:21'>Jer 2:21</a> ), had become useful for nothing. Failing to do the very thing God set her apart to do—bear fruit—she no longer served any purpose and was useless (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 15:2'>2</a> ). Other trees can be used for construction of certain things, but a fruitless vine is useless (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 15:3'>3</a> ). It has no value. In every age the people of God have their value in their fruitfulness. <a ref='Ezekiel 15:4–5'>15:4–5</a> <b>put into the fire.</b> The burning of the fruitless vine symbolized judgment in the deportations of 605 BC and 597 BC leading up to the final conquest in 586 BC. Isaiah made the same analogy in his prophecy ( <a ref='Isaiah 5:1–7'>Is 5:1–7</a> ), saying Israel produced only useless sour berries. <a ref='Ezekiel 15:6–8'>15:6–8</a> <b>Therefore.</b> The prophet applies the symbol to Israel and predicts the desolation of the city and the land. In the time of the Great Tribulation, it will be so again (cf. <a ref='Revelation 14:18'>Rev 14:18</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 16:1–7'>16:1–7</a> This section covers the period from Abraham entering Canaan (cf. <a ref='Ge 12'>Ge 12</a> ) through the exile in Egypt (cf. <a ref='Ex 12'>Ex 12</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 16:1'>16:1</a> <b>the word.</b> This longest chapter in Ezekiel is similar to chap. <a ref='Eze 23'>23</a> , in that both indict Judah as spiritually immoral (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:2'>2</a> ). The story of Israel’s sin and unfaithfulness to the love of God is told in all its sordid, vile character. The chapter is so sad and indicting that some of the ancient rabbis did not allow it to be read in public. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:3–5'>16:3–5</a> Israel was like an abandoned child. In <a ref='Ezekiel 16:4–14'>16:4–14</a> we see the history of Israel from her conception to her glory under Solomon. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:3'>16:3</a> <b>birth … Amorite … Hittite.</b> Cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:45'>16:45</a> . These names identify the residents of Canaan who occupied the land when Abraham migrated there (cf. <a ref='Genesis 12:5–6'>Ge 12:5–6</a> ). Jerusalem had the same moral character as the rest of Canaan. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:4–5'>16:4–5</a> Israel, in the day of its birth, was unwanted and uncared for. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:6'>16:6</a> <b>Live!</b> The time intended here is probably the patriarchal period of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, when God formed His people. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:7'>16:7</a> <b>numerous.</b> This refers more to the people than to the land. It seems to refer to the time of Israel’s growth during the 430-year stay in Egypt; wild but flourishing and beautiful Israel was “naked,” without the benefits of culture and civilization ( <a ref='Ge 46'>Ge 46</a> – <a ref='Ex 12'>Ex 12</a> ; cf. <a ref='Exodus 1:7'>Ex 1:7</a> , <a ref='Exodus 1:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Exodus 1:12'>12</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 16:8–14'>16:8–14</a> This is best taken as the time from the Exodus ( <a ref='Ex 12'>Ex 12ff.</a> ) through David’s reign ( <a ref='1Ki 2'>1Ki 2</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 16:8'>16:8</a> <b>the time for love.</b> This refers to the marriageable state. Spreading his “skirt” was a custom of espousal (cf. <a ref='Ruth 3:9'>Ru 3:9</a> ) and indicates that God entered into a covenant with the young nation at Mt. Sinai (cf. <a ref='Exodus 19:5–8'>Ex 19:5–8</a> ). Making a covenant signifies marriage, the figure of God’s relation to Israel (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 2:2'>Jer 2:2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 3:1'>3:1ff.</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 2:2–23'>Hos 2:2–23</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 16:9–14'>16:9–14</a> These gifts were marriage gifts customarily presented to a queen. The crowning may refer to the reigns of David and Solomon, when Jerusalem became the royal city. Israel was actually a small kingdom but with a great reputation (cf. <a ref='1Ki 10'>1Ki 10</a> ). This refers to the time from Joshua’s conquest of Canaan ( <a ref='Jos 3'>Jos 3ff.</a> ) through David’s reign (cf. <a ref='1Ki 2'>1Ki 2</a> ) and into Solomon’s time (before <a ref='1Ki 11'>1Ki 11</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 16:14'>16:14</a> <b>My majesty.</b> The nation was truly a trophy of God’s grace (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:6–8'>Dt 7:6–8</a> ). The presence and glory of Yahweh provided Jerusalem with her beauty and prominence. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:15–34'>16:15–34</a> Continuing the marriage metaphor, this section describes the spiritual harlotry of Israel from Solomon (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 11:1'>1Ki 11:1</a> ) all the way to Ezekiel’s time. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:15–19'>16:15–19</a> A general summary of the nation’s idolatry as she gave herself to the religious practices of the Canaanites. Every gracious gift from God was devoted to idols. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:20–22'>16:20–22</a> <b>sons and daughters.</b> This refers to the sacrifices of children to pagan gods (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:25–26'>20:25–26</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 20:31'>31</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 16:3'>2Ki 16:3</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 21:6'>21:6</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 23:10'>23:10</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 24:4'>24:4</a> ). God had expressly forbidden this (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:31'>Dt 12:31</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:10'>18:10</a> ). Still, the children were first slain, then burned (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 7:31'>Jer 7:31</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 19:5'>19:5</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 32:35'>32:35</a> ; <a ref='Micah 6:7'>Mic 6:7</a> ) until Josiah’s abolition of it. It had been reinstated in Ezekiel’s day. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:23–30'>16:23–30</a> This section, partly woe and partly lament, spoke to Judah’s obsession with idolatry and her being influenced by Egypt (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:26'>26</a> ), the Philistines (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:27'>27</a> ), Assyria (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:28'>28</a> ), and Chaldea, or Babylon (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:29'>29</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 16:27'>16:27</a> <b>ashamed.</b> The wickedness and gross evil of the Jews even scandalized pagan Philistines. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:29'>16:29</a> <b>Chaldea.</b> They even prostituted themselves with the Babylonians (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 20:12–19'>2Ki 20:12–19</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 16:31–34'>16:31–34</a> It is wicked to solicit and then be paid for immorality. Israel engaged in far worse behavior—she solicited and even paid her idol consorts. This refers to the heavy tribute Israel had to pay to the godless nations. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:35–40'>16:35–40</a> <b>I will … uncover your nakedness.</b> Public exposure of profligate women and the stoning of them were well-known customs in ancient Israel, making them a shameful spectacle. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:42'>16:42</a> By exacting the full penalty on Israel’s sins in the destruction by Babylon, God’s wrath was to be satisfied. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:44–45'>16:44–45</a> <b>Like mother, like daughter.</b> Judah has followed in the pagan footsteps of her beginnings (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:3'>16:3</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 16:46–59'>16:46–59</a> Judah is compared to Samaria and Sodom, whose judgment for sin was great. Judah was more corrupt (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:47'>47</a> ), multiplied Samaria’s and Sodom’s sin (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:51'>51</a> ), and committed more abominable sin (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:52'>52</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 16:60'>16:60</a> <b>I Myself will remember My covenant.</b> God is gracious and He always finds a covenant basis on which He can exercise His grace. Yahweh will remember the Abrahamic Covenant (cf. <a ref='Genesis 12:1'>Ge 12:1ff.</a> ) made with Israel in her youth. Restoration will be by grace, not merit. <b>an everlasting covenant.</b> This is the New Covenant, which is unconditional, saving, and everlasting (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:26'>37:26</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 59:21'>Is 59:21</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 61:8'>61:8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer 31:31–34</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 8:6–13'>Heb 8:6–13</a> ). The basis of God’s grace will not be the Mosaic Covenant, which the Jews could never fulfill, even with the best intentions (cf. <a ref='Exodus 24:1'>Ex 24:1ff.</a> ). When God establishes His eternal covenant, Israel will know that God is Yahweh because of His grace. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:63'>16:63</a> <b>have atoned for.</b> This looks to the cross of Christ (cf. <a ref='Is 53'>Is 53</a> ), by which God’s just wrath on sin was satisfied so that He could grant grace to all who believe (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 17:1'>17:1</a> This chapter is dated about 588 BC (two years before the destruction of Jerusalem).

The benevolent attitude of Nebuchadnezzar helped Zedekiah to prosper, and if he had remained faithful to his pledge to Nebuchadnezzar, Judah would have continued as a tributary kingdom. Instead, he began courting help from Egypt ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:13'>2Chr 36:13</a> ), which Jeremiah protested ( <a ref='Jeremiah 37:5–7'>Jer 37:5–7</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 17:7'>17:7</a> <b>another great eagle.</b> Egypt is meant (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 17:15'>15</a> ), specifically Pharaoh Apries, a.k.a.

Zedekiah broke the agreement (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 17:15'>15</a> ) in which he swore by Yahweh to submit to Babylon ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:13'>2Chr 36:13</a> ), and sought Egypt’s help, thus he was taken to Babylon to live out his life (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 17:16'>16</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 17:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 39:4–7'>Jer 39:4–7</a> ). Egypt was to be no help to him (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 17:17'>17</a> ) or any protector of his army (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 17:21'>21</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 17:22–23'>17:22–23</a> a sprig <b>from the lofty top.</b> This is messianic prophecy stating that God will provide the Messiah from the royal line of David (“the cedar”) and establish Him in His kingdom (like a “mountain,” cf. <a ref='Daniel 2:35'>Da 2:35</a> , <a ref='Daniel 2:44–45'>44–45</a> ). He will be “ <i>a sprig</i> ” reigning in the height of success. “Sprig,” or “branch,” is a name for Messiah (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 34:23–24'>34:23–24</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 37:24–25'>37:24–25</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 4:2'>Is 4:2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:5'>Jer 23:5</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 33:15'>33:15</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 3:8'>Zec 3:8</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 6:12'>6:12</a> ). Messiah will be “a tender one” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 17:22'>22</a> ) growing into a “majestic cedar” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 17:23'>23</a> ). Under His kingdom rule, all nations will be blessed and Israel restored. <a ref='Ezekiel 17:24'>17:24</a> <b>make the dry tree flourish.</b> The Messiah would grow out of the dry tree left after humbling judgment, i.e., Judah’s remnant from which He came of a lowly family (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 6:13'>Is 6:13</a> ), yet would prosper. <a ref='Ezekiel 18:1–32'>18:1–32</a> One of the foundational principles of Scripture is presented in this chapter (also taught in <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:16'>Dt 24:16</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 14:6'>2Ki 14:6</a> ): Judgment is according to individual faith and conduct. He had foretold national punishment, but the reason was individual sin (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:16–21'>3:16–21</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 14:12–20'>14:12–20</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 33:1–20'>33:1–20</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 18:2'>18:2</a> <b>eat the sour grapes.</b> The people of Judah would not acknowledge their guilt worthy of judgment. Though they were themselves wicked and idolatrous, they blamed their forefathers for their state (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 21:15'>2Ki 21:15</a> ). The rationalizing is expressed in a current proverb (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 31:29'>Jer 31:29</a> ) which means, in effect, “They sinned (eat the sour grapes); we inherit the bitterness” (teeth are set on edge). <a ref='Ezekiel 18:3'>18:3</a> <b>not going to use this proverb.</b> God rejected their blame shifting and evasion of responsibility. <a ref='Ezekiel 18:4'>18:4</a> <b>The soul who sins will die.</b> God played no favorites, but was fair in holding each individual accountable for his own sin. The death is physical death which, for many, results in eternal death. <a ref='Ezekiel 18:5–18'>18:5–18</a> Two scenarios are proposed to clarify the matter of personal guilt: 1) a righteous father of an unrighteous son (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 18:5–13'>5–13</a> ); and 2) an unrighteous father of a righteous son (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 18:14–18'>14–18</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 18:5'>18:5</a> <b>if a man is righteous.</b> The definition of “righteous” is given in specifics in vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 18:6–9'>6–9</a> . Such behavior could only characterize a genuine believer who was “faithful” from the heart. <a ref='Ezekiel 18:8'>18:8</a> <b>not lend</b> money <b>on interest.</b> This refers to interest on loans ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:19–20'>Dt 23:19–20</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:10–13'>24:10–13</a></i> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 18:9'>18:9</a> <b>he … will surely live.</b> The righteous do die physically for many reasons that do not contradict this principle, e.g., old age, martyrdom, or death in battle. While there are exceptions to “surely live” as to temporal life (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:3–4'>21:3–4</a> ), and sometimes the ungodly survive, unlike <a ref='Ezekiel 18:13'>18:13</a> (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 14:22–23'>14:22–23</a> ), there can be absolutely no exceptions in God’s ultimate spiritual reckoning. In every case, the just die to live eternally and the unjust, who never possessed spiritual life, shall perish physically and eternally ( <a ref='John 5:28–29'>Jn 5:28–29</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:11–15'>Rev 20:11–15</a> ). The just will live no matter what the character of his parents or children.

The righteous son shall “surely live” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 18:17'>17</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 18:19–20'>18:19–20</a> The prophet restated the principle of personal accountability. <a ref='Ezekiel 18:19–29'>18:19–29</a> Cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 33:12–20'>33:12–20</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 18:21–22'>18:21–22</a> <b>if the wicked man turns.</b> The next case involves an unrighteous person turning to righteousness.

But He invites repentance, so that hope may replace ruin (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 33:10–11'>33:10–11</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 18:31'>18:31</a> <b>make. … new heart.</b> The key to life eternal and triumph over death is conversion.

By contrast, He has no such pleasure when a person dies without repentance. While God is sovereign in salvation, man is responsible for his own sin. <b>turn back and live.</b> This was a call to repent and avoid physical and eternal death (cf. <a ref='Psalms 23:6'>Pss 23:6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 73:24'>73:24</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 26:19–21'>Is 26:19–21</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 12:2–3'>Da 12:2–3</a> , <a ref='Daniel 12:13'>13</a> ).

Though he reigned only 3 months, he was oppressive and unjust. God used the pagan nations of Egypt and Babylon to judge these wicked kings. The Babylonians kept Jehoiachin imprisoned for 37 years, releasing him at the age of 55 ( <a ref='2 Kings 25:27–30'>2Ki 25:27–30</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 52:31–32'>Jer 52:31–32</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 19:10–14'>19:10–14</a> <b>Your mother was like a vine.</b> Judah prospered as a luxuriant vine (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 19:10'>10</a> ), with strong power and eminence (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 19:11'>11</a> ). God plucked up the vine in judgment, desolating her (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 19:12'>12</a> ; cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 13:11–13'>13:11–13</a> ), exiling her (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 13:13'>13</a> ), and leaving no strong king (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 13:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 19:14'>19:14</a> The blame for the catastrophe that came to Judah is laid on one ruler, King Zedekiah, who was responsible for the burning of Jerusalem because of his treachery (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 38:20–23'>Jer 38:20–23</a> ). The house of David ended in shame and, for nearly 2,600 years since, Israel has had no king of David’s line. When Messiah came, they rejected Him and preferred Caesar. Messiah still became their Savior and will return as their King. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:1'>20:1</a> <b>the seventh year.</b> Ca. 591 BC. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:3–44'>20:3–44</a> <b>elders … come to inquire.</b> Cf. the similarity in <a ref='Ezekiel 14:1–3'>14:1–3</a> . The prophet responds with a message from Yahweh that gives a historical survey of Israel, featuring its uniform pattern of sin. Israel rebelled in Egypt (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:5–9'>5–9</a> ), then in the wilderness trek (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:10–26'>10–26</a> ), and the entry into the Land of Promise (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:27–32'>27–32</a> ). Through all this, God kept delivering them to save His reputation (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 20:14'>14</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 20:22'>22</a> ). Yet sinful obstinacy finally led to His judging them (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:45–49'>45–49</a> ). Verses <a ref='Ezekiel 20:33–44'>33–44</a> speak of His regathering Israel to their land in the future time of Christ’s Second Advent. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:5'>20:5</a> <b>I swore.</b> Cf. vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:5–6'>5–6</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 20:15'>15</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 20:23'>23</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 20:28'>28</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 20:42'>42</a> . God promised Israel deliverance from Egypt (cf. <a ref='Exodus 6:2–8'>Ex 6:2–8</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 20:25–26'>20:25–26</a> <b>I … gave them.</b> God allowed the Jews to live in sin.

Like all human beings, the story of the Jews is one long history of rebellion. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:34'>20:34</a> Paul alludes to this in <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:17'>2Co 6:17</a> . God will someday rule over Israel in the glorious kingdom of Messiah, after the people have repented and been saved (cf. <a ref='Zec 12-14'>Zec 12–14</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 20:35'>20:35</a> <b>wilderness of the peoples.</b> Other lands where the scattered people of Israel live are pictured as a wilderness in which the Jews will suffer. This is analogous to God’s bringing His people from Egypt through the wilderness long ago, before thrusting them into the Promised Land (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:36'>36</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 20:37'>20:37</a> <b>pass under the rod.</b> God used a shepherd figure here, apt since He was their Great Shepherd ( <a ref='Ezekiel 34:11–13'>34:11–13</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:5–8'>Jer 23:5–8</a> ). As a shepherd, God brings His sheep home to their fold (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 33:13'>Jer 33:13</a> ), has them file in, separating sheep from goats (cf. <a ref='Mt 25'>Mt 25</a> ), passing under His shepherd’s rod to be noted and checked for injury. He will bring them into the bond of the New Covenant by giving them His Spirit with life ( <a ref='Ezekiel 36:24–27'>36:24–27</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 37:14'>37:14</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 39:29'>39:29</a> ). This is Israel’s final salvation ( <a ref='Romans 11:26–33'>Ro 11:26–33</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 20:38'>20:38</a> <b>I will purge from you the rebels.</b> God will see that no rebel, no one without the renewing by His Spirit in salvation, will come back to Israel to have a part in the messianic kingdom. All whom He permits to return will serve Him (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:40'>40</a> ), in contrast to those who serve idols (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:39'>39</a> ). The purging takes place during the “time of Jacob’s distress” ( <a ref='Jeremiah 30:7'>Jer 30:7</a> ), during the Great Tribulation ( <a ref='Matthew 24:21'>Mt 24:21</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 20:39'>20:39</a> If they persist in their stubborn idolatry, God will allow them to follow it to their doom. He would also rather have them as out-and-out idolaters rather than hypocritical patronizers of His worship as they had been (cf. <a ref='Amos 5:21–26'>Am 5:21–26</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 20:40–42'>20:40–42</a> <b>all … in the land.</b> The promised regathering in Messiah’s earthly kingdom is to the very same land—literal Palestine—from which they were scattered (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:41'>41</a> ), expressly the land given to their fathers ( <a ref='Ezekiel 36:28'>36:28</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 12:7'>Ge 12:7</a> ). They will “all” be there, repentant (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:43'>43</a> ) and saved ( <a ref='Romans 11:26–27'>Ro 11:26–27</a> ), serving Yahweh wholeheartedly, a united nation engaged in purified worship (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 27:22–23'>27:22–23</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:13'>Is 11:13</a> ). Nations and Cities Under Judgment in Ezekiel Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Ezekiel 20:44'>20:44</a> <b>you will know.</b> God purposed all of this great restoration so that repentant, renewed Israel knew that He is Yahweh, a key theme, as in v. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:38'>38</a> . Also, those of other nations will know by this who He is and render Him due reverence (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:41'>41</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 36:23'>36:23</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 36:36'>36</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 20:46–48'>20:46–48</a> <b>speak, dripping out</b> words <b>, against the south.</b> The south is Palestine, particularly Judah, usually invaded from the north. Though Babylonia was to the east ( <a ref='Ezekiel 19:12'>19:12</a> ), its army would swing west toward the Mediterranean Sea and then come south out of the north to invade Judah. The invader (Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC) will overwhelm the land as a sweeping fire (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 15:1–8'>15:1–8</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 19:12'>19:12</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 11:1–3'>Zec 11:1–3</a> ), devouring trees indiscriminately, green or dry (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:3–4'>21:3–4</a> ). Palestine had much more “forest” in biblical times. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:49'>20:49</a> This demonstrates the elders’ (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:1'>1</a> ) refusal to comprehend Ezekiel’s clear message. To the unwilling heart, there was no understanding. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:1–7'>21:1–7</a> <b>the word … came.</b> This is the sign of the sword against Jerusalem (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:1–17'>1–17</a> ). God depicts His judgment in terms of a man unsheathing his polished sword for deadly thrusts. God is the swordsman (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:3–4'>3–4</a> ), but Babylon is His sword (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:19'>19</a> ). The historical background for this prophecy is Nebuchadnezzar’s 588 BC campaign to quell revolts in Judah, as well as Tyre and Ammon. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:3–4'>21:3–4</a> <b>the righteous and the wicked.</b> In Babylon’s indiscrimination as an invader, people in the army’s path die, whether righteous or wicked. This occurs from north to south, through the whole span of Israel’s land, tying in with the judgment pictured by fire ( <a ref='Ezekiel 20:45–49'>20:45–49</a> ). Trees green or dry ( <a ref='Ezekiel 20:47'>20:47</a> ) probably depict people whether righteous or wicked ( <a ref='Ezekiel 21:3–4'>21:3–4</a> ; cf. <a ref='Luke 23:31'>Lk 23:31</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 21:8–17'>21:8–17</a> The sword (Babylon) was “sharpened.” <a ref='Ezekiel 21:10'>21:10</a> <b>the scepter … despises every tree.</b> Cf. also v. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:13'>13</a> . Possibly this affirmed that God’s sword, so overwhelming in v. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:10'>10a</a> , was to despise the Judean royal scepter (cf. <a ref='Genesis 49:9–10'>Ge 49:9–10</a> ), which was powerless to stop it and would soon pass away (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:25–27'>25–27</a> ). God’s judgment was too strong for this object made of (or partly of) wood, as it holds in contempt all such items of wood. “My son” may refer to Judah (cf. <a ref='Exodus 4:22–23'>Ex 4:22–23</a> ), or to the king as God’s “son,” such as was Solomon ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 28:6'>1Chr 28:6</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 21:11'>21:11</a> <b>the one who kills.</b> God is always the judge and executioner, no matter what He uses. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:12'>21:12</a> <b>slap</b> your <b>thigh.</b> Or it can be translated, “beat your breast.” In either wording, it is an emphatic gesture of grief that the prophet acts out. This accompanies further symbols of grief in his “cry out and wail” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:12'>12</a> ) and “strike” of hands (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:14'>14</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 21:17'>17</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 21:18–20'>21:18–20</a> This imagery sees Babylon’s army on the march coming to a crossroads. The sword is the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, who is faced with a decision. One sign points to Jerusalem and Judah, the other to Rabbah, the capital of Ammon. In 593 BC Ammon had conspired with Judah against Babylon. The king had to decide which place to attack, so he sought his gods through divination (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:21'>21</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 21:21'>21:21</a> <b>the king … stands … to use divination.</b> This means to “seek an omen,” to gain guidance from superstitious devices (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 47:8–15'>Is 47:8–15</a> ). Three methods are available to Babylon’s leader. He shook arrows and let them fall, then read a conclusion from the pattern. He looked at Teraphim (idols), or examined an animal liver to gain help from his gods. Actually, the true God controlled this superstition to achieve His will, the attack on Jerusalem and Judah. Later, Nebuchadnezzar attacked Rabbah in Ammon east of the Jordan (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:28–32'>28–32</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 21:22'>21:22</a> All the paraphernalia of war were prepared. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:23'>21:23</a> <b>worthless divination.</b> The people of Jerusalem thought this superstitious decision was not a true divination and would fail. They were wrong (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:24–25'>24–25</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 21:25'>21:25</a> <b>wicked … prince.</b> Zedekiah. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:26'>21:26</a> <b>Remove … turban … crown.</b> God, in the coming judgment on Judah in 588–586 BC, removed the turban representing the priestly leadership, and the crown picturing the succession of kings. Neither office was fully restored after the captivity. This marked the commencement of “the times of the Gentiles” ( <a ref='Luke 21:24'>Lk 21:24</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 21:27'>21:27</a> <b>until He comes.</b> The 3-fold mention of “ruin” expresses the severest degree of unsettled and chaotic conditions. Israel was to experience severe instability and even the kingly privilege will not be Israel’s again until the coming of the Messiah, “to whom the <i>legal</i> judgment belongs” (cf. <a ref='Genesis 49:10'>Ge 49:10</a> ). God will give the kingship to Him (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 23:5–8'>Jer 23:5–8</a> ), the greater “David” ( <a ref='Ezekiel 37:24'>Eze 37:24</a> ). His “ <i>legal</i> judgment” is that perfect combination of priestly and royal offices (cf. <a ref='Heb 5-7'>Heb 5–7</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 21:28–32'>21:28–32</a> <b>concerning the sons of Ammon.</b> The Babylonian armies also were to conquer this people in 582/81 BC (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 25:1–7'>25:1–7</a> ). Their “reproach” was the gleeful disdain they heaped on Jerusalem when the city fell, the temple was profaned, and Judeans were taken captive ( <a ref='Ezekiel 25:3'>25:3</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 21:30'>21:30</a> <b>Return</b> it <b>to its sheath.</b> This called for the Ammonites not to resist Babylon, which would be useless, for they would be slaughtered in their own land. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:32'>21:32</a> <b>You will not be remembered.</b> Israel had a future (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:27'>27</a> ), but God would not give Ammon mercy at the time and let the devastation occur. After this, they were further devastated by Judas Maccabeus’ army, according to an ancient source (1Macc 5:6–7). Later, according to <a ref='Jeremiah 49:6'>Jeremiah 49:6</a> , God permitted exiles to return to their land. Finally, they disappeared from the family of nations altogether. <a ref='Ezekiel 22:2'>22:2</a> <b>the city of blood?</b> Cf. vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 22:3–4'>3–4</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 22:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 22:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 22:12–13'>12–13</a> .

They did all the evil they could, and shedding blood seemed to be the most popular. <a ref='Ezekiel 22:5'>22:5</a> Cf. <a ref='Romans 2:24'>Ro 2:24</a> . God links His honor to the behavior of His people. <a ref='Ezekiel 22:9'>22:9</a> <b>eaten at the mountain</b> shrines <b>.</b> This meant idol worship which the passage clarifies (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 22:4'>4</a> ), i.e., eating meals at idol shrines, accompanied by sexual sins, such as those described in vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 22:10–11'>10–11</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 22:14–16'>22:14–16</a> Ezekiel saw not only the punishment in the immediate future, but the worldwide dispersion of the Jews still going on today, which continues for the purging of Israel’s sins. <a ref='Ezekiel 22:16'>22:16</a> <b>you will know.</b> After the defiling dispersion, when the sin has been purged, Israel will come to know Yahweh. Many Jews do know Him now, but the nation will be saved in the future (cf. <a ref='Zec 12-14'>Zec 12–14</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 22:17–22'>22:17–22</a> <b>bronze and tin and iron and lead.</b> This pictures God’s judgment of Jerusalem as a smelting furnace (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 1:22'>Is 1:22</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 6:28–30'>Jer 6:28–30</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 13:9'>Zec 13:9</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 3:2–3'>Mal 3:2–3</a> ) which burns away dross and impurities, resulting in purified metal. His wrath was the fire (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 22:21'>21</a> ; an apt term for Babylon’s fiery destruction of the city), and His people were to be refined (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 22:20'>20</a> ), with the sinful ones removed (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 21:13–22'>21:13–22</a> ). Even in the ultimate day, God will follow this principle in purging His creation of sin ( <a ref='2 Peter 3:9–14'>2Pe 3:9–14</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 22:25–29'>22:25–29</a> <b>conspiracy.</b> The whole nation was wicked. First, all leaders are indicted for their vicious sin: prophets, priests, princes, then the people in general. <a ref='Ezekiel 22:30'>22:30</a> <b>I searched for a man.</b> Ezekiel and Jeremiah were faithful, but apart from them God sought a man capable of advocacy for Israel when its sin had gone so far. But no one could lead the people to repentance and draw the nation back from the brink of the judgment that came in 586 BC ( <a ref='Jeremiah 7:26'>Jer 7:26</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 7:34'>34</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 19:15'>19:15</a> ). Only God’s Messiah, God Himself, will have the character and the credentials sufficient to do what no man can do, intercede for Israel (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 59:16–19'>Is 59:16–19</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 63:5'>63:5</a> ; <a ref='Rev 5'>Rev 5</a> ). He was rejected by them in His earthly ministry, so the effects of this judgment continue today, until they turn to Him in faith (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 12:10'>Zec 12:10</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 13:1'>13:1</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 23:2–4'>23:2–4</a> <b>two women.</b> This chapter describes the spiritual infidelity of Israel and Judah, pictured as two sisters, to convey the gravity of sin in Judah. “One mother” refers to the united kingdom, while “two women” refers to the divided kingdom. Oholah, meaning “Her own tabernacle,” as she had her separate dwelling-place apart from the temple, represents Samaria. In the northern kingdom, Jeroboam had set up worship, which God rejected. Oholibah, “My tabernacle is in her,” represents Jerusalem, where God did establish worship. <a ref='Ezekiel 23:5–10'>23:5–10</a> <b>Oholah played the harlot.</b> The northern kingdom of Israel was a harlot, in a spiritual sense, by seeking union for fulfillment and security with idolatrous, young, wealthy, attractive Assyria. Assyria turned on her (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 23:10'>10</a> ), conquered her, and deported Israel in 722 BC ( <a ref='2Ki 17'>2Ki 17</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 23:11–21'>23:11–21</a> <b>more corrupt.</b> Cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 16:47'>16:47</a> . The focus is Judah’s (the southern kingdom) craving for Babylonian idolatry that alienated her from God.

Social and political alliance led to spiritual defection. <a ref='Ezekiel 23:17'>23:17</a> <b>to the bed of love.</b> The description portrays spiritual unfaithfulness graphically (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 23:30'>30</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 23:19'>23:19</a> Judah renewed her old sins from the days of Egypt, returning to her first degradation. <a ref='Ezekiel 23:22–35'>23:22–35</a> <b>arouse your lovers.</b> God’s anger at Judah’s sin prompted His bringing Babylonians and others to deal severely with her. The passage sets forth how Judah’s companion nations were the instruments of her judgment. <a ref='Ezekiel 23:23'>23:23</a> <b>Pekod and Shoa and Koa.</b> Three different Aramean tribes. <a ref='Ezekiel 23:25'>23:25</a> <b>remove your nose and your ears.</b> Atrocities by Babylonians would include facial dismemberment, ancient punishment for an adulteress practiced in Egypt, Chaldea, and elsewhere. <a ref='Ezekiel 23:32–34'>23:32–34</a> <b>drink your sister’s cup.</b> Judah was to experience the “cup” of God’s judgment as Samaria had in 722 BC (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 23:46–49'>23:46–49</a> ). Often the idea of “drinking a cup” is symbolic of receiving God’s wrath (cf. <a ref='Psalms 75:8'>Ps 75:8</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 51:17–22'>Is 51:17–22</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 25:15–29'>Jer 25:15–29</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 20:22'>Mt 20:22</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 23:36–42'>23:36–42</a> The prophet detailed a shameful summary of God’s case against the nation—a double arraignment calling for judgment. <a ref='Ezekiel 23:45'>23:45</a> <b>righteous men.</b> This likely refers to the remnant of godly people in the nation who would affirm the justice of judgment. <a ref='Ezekiel 24:1–2'>24:1–2</a> <b>this very day.</b> The time was Jan. 15, 588 BC (dating from 597 as in <a ref='Ezekiel 1:2'>1:2</a> ). The Babylonians began the 18-month siege of Jerusalem ( <a ref='Jeremiah 39:1–2'>Jer 39:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 52:4–12'>52:4–12</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 24:3–5'>24:3–5</a> <b>Speak a parable.</b> The choice cuts of lamb picture God’s flock being boiled in a pot, symbolizing Jerusalem in the heat of the siege. Cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 11:3'>11:3</a> . Animal bones were frequently used for fuel. <a ref='Ezekiel 24:6'>24:6</a> <b>Woe to the city of blood.</b> Jerusalem’s populace was guilty of bloody corruption, which was pictured by the boiled scum or rust in the pot (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 22:2'>22:2</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 24:7'>24:7</a> <b>her blood.</b> The city’s blood (a general symbol of sin) was blatantly open, not hidden, as depicted by exposure on top of a rock. When blood was not covered with dust, the law was violated ( <a ref='Leviticus 17:13'>Lv 17:13</a> ). God’s vengeance would come by Babylon’s army. <a ref='Ezekiel 24:9–10'>24:9–10</a> <b>the pile great … bones be burned.</b> Intensely provoked by sin, God wanted Ezekiel to picture the fire as furious judgment that kills the people. <a ref='Ezekiel 24:11–12'>24:11–12</a> <b>stand it empty.</b> After all pieces (people) were burned up, then the pot was heated empty. This portrayed Yahweh’s thorough follow-through by the besieger to totally destroy the city and the temple, with all its residue (cf. the treatment of a leprous house in <a ref='Leviticus 14:34–45'>Lv 14:34–45</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 24:16–27'>24:16–27</a> Ezekiel’s wife died as a sign to Israel. All personal sorrow was eclipsed in the universal calamity. Just as Ezekiel was not to mourn the death of his wife (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 24:17'>17</a> ), so Israel was not to mourn the death of her families (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 24:19–24'>19–24</a> ). Though the text emphasizes how precious his wife was, the “desire of [his] eyes” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 24:16'>16</a> ), he was obedient and submitted to God’s will. He became a heartbreaking sign to his people. <a ref='Ezekiel 24:25'>24:25</a> <b>on the day.</b> This refers to the destruction of the temple. <a ref='Ezekiel 24:26–27'>24:26–27</a> <b>on that day.</b> One who escaped the destruction of Jerusalem (586 BC) would come to Ezekiel in Babylon and report the story. From that day forward, he was to be silent until the captives arrived; then he could speak of Judah (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:26–27'>3:26–27</a> ). This was about a two-year period (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 33:21'>33:21</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 52:5–7'>Jer 52:5–7</a> ), when there was no need to preach judgment because it had come. He did speak of other nations (as recorded beginning in chap. <a ref='Eze 25'>25</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 25:1'>25:1</a> <b>the word of Yahweh came.</b> <a ref='Ezekiel 25:1–32:32'>Ezekiel 25:1—32:32</a> proclaims judgments on 7 other nations, similar to the series in <a ref='Je 46-51'>Jer 46–51</a> . Four of them are singled out in this chapter for vindictive jealousy and hate toward Israel. After devoting chaps. <a ref='Eze 1-24'>1–24</a> to calamity on His chosen nation, it is fitting that God should reveal His impartiality toward all sinners and give the prophet judgments to proclaim on Gentiles. Israel’s sinful failure had profaned God’s honor in the eyes of these peoples ( <a ref='Ezekiel 36:21–23'>36:21–23</a> ), but these nations had falsely assumed that when Israel was exiled, their God was defeated. <a ref='Ezekiel 25:2–3'>25:2–3</a> <b>toward the sons of Ammon.</b> These people lived on the edge of the desert east of the Jordan River and north of Moab. They had joined Babylon against Judah about 600 BC ( <a ref='2 Kings 24:2'>2Ki 24:2ff.</a> ). In 594 BC, together with other nations, they tried to influence Judah to ally with them against Babylon ( <a ref='Jeremiah 27:2'>Jer 27:2ff.</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 21:18–20'>Ezekiel 21:18–20</a> indicates that Babylon came after them. There is no record of an attack, so they must have surrendered ( <a ref='Ezekiel 21:28'>21:28</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 2:8–11'>Zep 2:8–11</a> ). They were of incestuous origin (cf. <a ref='Genesis 19:37–38'>Ge 19:37–38</a> ) and often hostile toward Judah (cf. <a ref='Jdg 10'>Jdg 10</a> ; <a ref='1Sa 11'>1Sa 11</a> ; <a ref='2Sa 10'>2Sa 10</a> , <a ref='2Sa 12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 49:1–6'>Jer 49:1–6</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 2:15'>Lam 2:15</a> ; <a ref='Amos 1:13–15'>Am 1:13–15</a> ). God judged this people because of their enmity against Israel (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 25:3'>3</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 25:6'>6</a> ). They expressed malicious pleasure at the dishonoring of the temple, desolation of the land, and dispersion of the inhabitants. <a ref='Ezekiel 25:4'>25:4</a> <b>going to give you to the sons of the east.</b> Perhaps this meant the coming of Babylon from the east which would devastate Ammon in either 588–86 BC or 582/81 BC. Or it could refer to their land being occupied by the various nomadic tribes living beyond the Jordan. <a ref='Ezekiel 25:5'>25:5</a> <b>Rabbah.</b> This important Ammonite capital (cf. <a ref='Amos 1:14'>Am 1:14</a> ), now called Amman, is about 25 mi. northeast of the upper tip of the Dead Sea, east of the Jordan River. <a ref='Ezekiel 25:7'>25:7</a> <b>make you perish.</b> Ammonites would be destroyed and eliminated from their land. Yet, <a ref='Jeremiah 49:6'>Jer 49:6</a> assures a later return of a remnant of these scattered people. <a ref='Ezekiel 25:8–11'>25:8–11</a> <b>Moab and Seir.</b> The origin of these people is given in <a ref='Genesis 19:37–38'>Ge 19:37–38</a> . Their land was the area south of the Arnon River along the lower region of the Dead Sea. Cf. <a ref='Is 15-16'>Is 15–16</a> ; <a ref='Je 48'>Jer 48</a> ; <a ref='Amos 2:1–3'>Am 2:1–3</a> . The Babylonians destroyed cities there in 582/81 BC. The reason for judgment (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 25:8'>8</a> ) also included their gloating over Israel’s fall, as well as their scorn in saying Israel was like all other people with no privileged position before God. Both Ammonites and Moabites became absorbed into the Arabian peoples. <a ref='Ezekiel 25:8'>25:8</a> <b>Seir.</b> Another name for the adjacent Edomite area ( <a ref='Genesis 32:3'>Ge 32:3</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 36:20–21'>36:20–21</a> , <a ref='Genesis 36:30'>30</a> ), dominated by Mt. Seir and a mountainous, extremely rugged, rocky country. Her judgments are given in <a ref='Ezekiel 25:12–14'>25:12–14</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 25:12'>25:12</a> <b>Edom.</b> Cf. chap. <a ref='Eze 35'>35</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 21:11–12'>Is 21:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 49:7–22'>Jer 49:7–22</a> ; <a ref='Amos 1:11–12'>Am 1:11–12</a> ; Obadiah; <a ref='Malachi 1:3–5'>Mal 1:3–5</a> . These people lived south of Moab from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqabah. These people had been almost annihilated by David ( <a ref='2 Samuel 8:14'>2Sa 8:14</a> ), but won back independence during the reign of Ahaz (ca. 735–715 BC). Their revenge was hostility to Israel constantly (cf. <a ref='Genesis 27:27–41'>Ge 27:27–41</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 34:5–7'>Is 34:5–7</a> ). The reason for judgment is Edom’s disdain when the Israelites were devastated in 588–86 BC. They acted like a cheering section for Babylon, “Tear it down! Tear it down” ( <a ref='Psalms 137:7'>Ps 137:7</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 4:21–22'>Lam 4:21–22</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 25:13–14'>25:13–14</a> <b>against Edom … by the hand of My people Israel.</b> The Arab tribe called Nabateans invaded Edom in 325 BC; but it was the Jewish forces of Judas Maccabeus in 164 BC and John Hyrcanus in 126 BC who fully subjugated Edom. Jews even compelled Edomites to submit to their religion. All 3 of these nations (Ammon, Moab, and Edom) have disappeared as separate nations into the Arab peoples. <a ref='Ezekiel 25:13'>25:13</a> <b>Teman … Dedan.</b> Reference is to key Edomite towns. Teman (Teima) was possibly 200 mi. east of the Dead Sea in the Arabian Desert in the northern expanse of Edom’s territory. Dedan was maybe located 100 mi. south of Teman, yet far east of the Red Sea. <a ref='Ezekiel 25:15–17'>25:15–17</a> <b>the Philistines.</b> Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 14:29–32'>Is 14:29–32</a> ; <a ref='Je 47'>Jer 47</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:4'>Joel 3:4</a> ; <a ref='Amos 1:6–8'>Am 1:6–8</a> ; <a ref='Obadiah 1:19'>Ob 19</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 2:4–7'>Zep 2:4–7</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 9:5'>Zec 9:5</a> . The reason for their judgment was perpetual enmity and vengefulness against Israel, which perpetuated the “old hatred” from as far back as <a ref='Jdg 13-16'>Jdg 13–16</a> . They constantly harassed and oppressed Israel until David broke their power during Saul’s reign ( <a ref='1Sa 17'>1Sa 17</a> ). They repeatedly rose up and were subdued by Israel. Nebuchadnezzar invaded their land ( <a ref='Je 47'>Jer 47</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 25:16'>25:16</a> <b>Cherethites.</b> They originated in Crete and became part of the Philistine nation ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 Samuel 30:14'>1Sa 30:14</a></i> ), with some serving in David’s bodyguard ( <a ref='2 Samuel 8:18'>2Sa 8:18</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 15:18'>15:18</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 25:17'>25:17</a> <b>great vengeance.</b> This was fulfilled at the time of Babylon’s invasion of 588–86 BC or 582/81 BC (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 25:20'>Jer 25:20</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 47:1–7'>47:1–7</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 26:1'>26:1</a> <b>the eleventh year.</b> In 586 BC, the 11th year of Jehoiachin’s captivity, on the tenth day of the fifth month, Jerusalem was captured. <a ref='Ezekiel 26:3–4'>26:3–4</a> <b>I am against you, O Tyre.</b> The judgment of this city covers 3 chaps. ( <a ref='Eze 26-28'>26–28</a> ), indicating its importance to God. Cf. <a ref='Is 23'>Is 23</a> ; <a ref='Amos 1:9–10'>Am 1:9–10</a> . Tyre was an ancient city of the Phoenicians, appearing for the first time in <a ref='Joshua 19:29'>Jos 19:29</a> . During the reigns of David and Solomon it had great influence. Hiram, its king, was a friend to David ( <a ref='2 Samuel 5:11'>2Sa 5:11</a> ), who helped him and Solomon in building operations (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 5:1–12'>1Ki 5:1–12</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 14:1'>1Chr 14:1</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:3'>2Chr 2:3</a> , <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:11'>11</a> ). Later, Tyrians sold Jews into slavery (cf. <a ref='Joel 3:4–8'>Joel 3:4–8</a> ; <a ref='Amos 1:9–10'>Am 1:9–10</a> ). God would move “many nations” to invade Tyre, the commercial center of the Mediterranean (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 27:3'>27:3</a> ), in successive attacks pictured by wave following wave. Babylon (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 26:7'>7</a> ) besieged Tyre from 585–573 BC; later came Alexander’s Grecian army in 332 BC. Babylon had devastated the coastal city, but many Tyrians escaped to an island fortress which withstood attack. The later Grecian attackers “scraped” all the remaining “debris” and rubble and dumped it into the sea, building a causeway to the island nearly a half mile out. They also brought ships and overcame the fortress defenders in a devastating assault on Tyre. The predictions in chaps. <a ref='Eze 26-28'>26–28</a> have been fulfilled with amazing literal accuracy. <a ref='Ezekiel 26:5'>26:5</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 26:14'>14</a> <b>for the spreading of nets.</b> Tyre became a fishing city, a place to spread fishing nets for centuries, until the Saracens finally destroyed what was left in the fourth century. Since then the once great center of Mediterranean commerce has been a nondescript village. <a ref='Ezekiel 26:7–14'>26:7–14</a> Here is a vivid description of the original devastation by Babylon’s King Nebuchadnezzar called “king of kings” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 26:7'>7</a> ) because so many other rulers were subject to him. God had given him universal rule (cf. <a ref='Daniel 2:37'>Da 2:37</a> ). Verses <a ref='Ezekiel 26:8'>8</a> and <a ref='Ezekiel 26:9'>9</a> describe the siege, vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 26:10–14'>10–14</a> , the devastation. <a ref='Ezekiel 26:12'>26:12</a> <b>they will … spoil.</b> After Nebuchadnezzar in v. <a ref='Ezekiel 26:7'>7</a> and “he” and “his” in vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 26:8–11'>8–11</a> , “they” in v. <a ref='Ezekiel 26:12'>12</a> appears to broaden the reference to others among the “many nations” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 26:3'>3</a> ). At this point, “they” are not only Babylonians, but also Alexander’s army which later heaped debris from the ruins into the sea to advance to the island stronghold (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 9:3–4'>Zec 9:3–4</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 26:13'>26:13</a> <b>songs … harps.</b> According to <a ref='Isaiah 23:16'>Is 23:16</a> , Tyre was famous for musicians. <a ref='Ezekiel 26:15–18'>26:15–18</a> So important a center of commerce could not be destroyed without affecting all the nearby nations. All the nations around the Mediterranean would consider Tyre’s fall a calamity. According to customs of mourning, rulers would descend from their thrones and disrobe. <a ref='Ezekiel 26:19–21'>26:19–21</a> Tyre’s destruction is compared to a dead person placed in the grave. <a ref='Ezekiel 27:1–11'>27:1–11</a> <b>a lamentation over Tyre.</b> The whole chapter is a lamentation, describing Tyre as a great trade ship destroyed on the high seas.

The sea, the place of her glory, will be her grave. “The east wind” is a picture of Babylon in its power from the east (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 13:11–13'>13:11–13</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 27:28–35'>27:28–35</a> <b>the cry.</b> This maintains the metaphor of Tyre as a ship and turns particularly to men lamenting her ruin, for their livelihood has been tied to the commerce she represents.

In both passages, some of the language best fits Satan. Most likely, both texts primarily describe the human king who is being used by Satan, much like Peter when Jesus said to him, “Get behind Me, Satan!” ( <a ref='Matthew 16:23'>Mt 16:23</a> ). The judgment can certainly apply to Satan also. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:2'>28:2</a> <b>to the ruler of Tyre.</b> Since “ruler,” or “prince,” is sometimes used to mean “the king” ( <a ref='Ezekiel 37:24–25'>37:24–25</a> ), the “ruler” in v. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:2'>2</a> is the “king” in v. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:12'>12</a> , Itto-baal II. The prophet is dealing with the spirit of Tyre more than just the king. This prophecy is dated shortly before the siege of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar (585–573 BC). <b>I am a god.</b> Many ancient kings claimed to be a god, and acted as if they were (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:6'>6</a> ). When this king claimed to be a god, he was displaying the same proud attitude as the serpent who promised Adam and Eve they could be like God ( <a ref='Genesis 3:5'>Ge 3:5</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 28:3–5'>28:3–5</a> <b>wiser than Daniel.</b> This is said in sarcastic derision of the leader’s own exaggerated claims. Here is an indicator that Daniel, who had been captive for years in Babylon, had become well known. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:6–10'>28:6–10</a> <b>strangers upon you … strangers.</b> The reference is to invading Babylonians, and later the Greeks (cf. chap. <a ref='Eze 26'>26</a> ). God was the true executioner. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:11–19'>28:11–19</a> This lament over “the king of Tyre” reached behind to the real supernatural source of wickedness, Satan. Cf. <a ref='Matthew 16:21–23'>Mt 16:21–23</a> , where Peter was rebuked by Yahweh, as under Satanic control and motivation. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:12'>28:12</a> <b>the seal of perfection.</b> Yahweh led Ezekiel to address the king as the one to be judged, but clearly the power behind him was Satan. This phrase must be associated with Satan as one perfect in angelic beauty before he rebelled against God. But, it can also relate to “perfection” in the same context of Tyre’s enterprise, topmost in its trade to the ancient world ( <a ref='Ezekiel 27:3–4'>27:3–4</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 27:11'>11</a> ), glorious in her seafaring efforts ( <a ref='Ezekiel 27:24'>27:24</a> ), and the crowning city ( <a ref='Isaiah 23:8'>Is 23:8</a> ), i.e., “perfect” as Jerusalem also is said to be ( <a ref='Ezekiel 16:14'>16:14</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 2:15'>Lam 2:15</a> ). <b>Full of wisdom.</b> This referred to Satan’s wisdom as an angel and to Tyre’s wisdom (skill) in trade (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 27:8–9'>27:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 28:4'>28:4</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 28:13'>28:13</a> <b>You were in Eden.</b> This could be Satan in the Garden of Eden ( <a ref='Genesis 3:1–15'>Ge 3:1–15</a> ), or it might refer to Tyre’s king in a beautiful environment, a kind of Eden. <b>Every precious stone.</b> This depicts Satan’s rich investiture ( <a ref='Genesis 2:12'>Ge 2:12</a> ), and/or Tyre’s king possessing every beautiful stone as Solomon had ( <a ref='1 Kings 10:10'>1Ki 10:10</a> ). <b>workmanship of your settings.</b> This could refer both to Satan’s once being in charge of heavenly praise and to Tyre’s beautiful musical instruments used in celebration ( <a ref='Ezekiel 26:13'>26:13</a> ). <b>you were created.</b> Satan, however, is more likely to have such wealth and beauty, wisdom, and perfection at his creation than this earthly king would have at his birth. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:14'>28:14</a> <b>anointed cherub.</b> This refers to Satan in his exalted privilege as an angel guarding (i.e., covering) God’s throne, as cherubim guarded Eden ( <a ref='Genesis 3:24'>Ge 3:24</a> ). Satan originally had continuous and unrestricted access to the glorious presence of God. <b>I placed you.</b> This was true of both Satan, by God’s sovereign permission, and Tyre’s king. <b>You were on the holy mountain.</b> A high privilege is meant, whether referring to Satan before God in His kingdom (mountain, cf. <a ref='Daniel 2:35'>Da 2:35</a> ), or Tyre’s monarch described in a picturesque analogy, as Assyria can be described as a cedar in Lebanon ( <a ref='Ezekiel 31:3'>31:3</a> ) to convey a picture of towering height. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:15'>28:15</a> <b>blameless in your ways.</b> This verse was not completely true of the king, but it was accurate of Satan before he sinned. <b>Until unrighteousness was found in you.</b> Satan’s sin of pride (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 14:14'>Is 14:14</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 3:6'>1Ti 3:6</a> ) is in view here. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:16'>28:16</a> The description transitions to feature the king of Tyre, describing his demise, as he followed the pattern of Satan himself. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:17–19'>28:17–19</a> <b>I put you before kings.</b> It would be difficult to relate this to Satan. The earthly king of Tyre, in his downfall, would be knocked or cast to the ground, cut down, and lie before the gaze of other kings. From <a ref='Isaiah 23:17'>Is 23:17</a> there is the implication of a revival under Persian rule ( <a ref='Nehemiah 13:16'>Ne 13:16</a> ). Two hundred and fifty years after Nebuchadnezzar, Tyre was strong enough to hold off Alexander for 7 years. The Romans made it a capital of the province. Gradually it disappeared, and its location is not prominent. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:21'>28:21</a> <b>Sidon.</b> Sidon (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:20–24'>20–24</a> ) is a sister seaport to Tyre in Phoenicia, 23 mi. north. Even in the time of the judges ( <a ref='Judges 10:6'>Jdg 10:6</a> ), the corrupting influence of this place had begun. It was the headquarters for Baal worship. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:22–23'>28:22–23</a> <b>judgments in her.</b> God is to bring bloodshed and pestilence on people there, probably at the time He brings an invasion against Tyre. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:24'>28:24</a> <b>no more. … prickling brier.</b> This is a summary of the judgment scenarios so far revealed (chaps. <a ref='Eze 25-28'>25–28</a> ). The enemies of Israel would be so devastated by God that 1) they would no longer be pestering Israel, and 2) they would see that the God who judges them is the true God of Israel. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:25–26'>28:25–26</a> <b>When I gather.</b> In this brief excursus of hope, God promised to restore Israel to their land (cf. chaps. <a ref='Eze 34'>34</a> , <a ref='Eze 36-39'>36–39</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 65:21'>Is 65:21</a> ; <a ref='Je 30-33'>Jer 30–33</a> ; <a ref='Amos 9:14–15'>Am 9:14–15</a> ). This looks to Messiah’s earthly kingdom. <a ref='Ezekiel 29:1'>29:1</a> <b>the tenth year.</b> 587 BC is the 10th year after Jehoiachin’s deportation. It is a year and two days after Nebuchadnezzar had come to Jerusalem ( <a ref='Ezekiel 24:1–2'>24:1–2</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 25:1'>2Ki 25:1</a> ) and 7 months before its destruction ( <a ref='2 Kings 25:3–8'>2Ki 25:3–8</a> ). This is the first of 7 oracles against Egypt (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 29:17'>29:17</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 30:1'>30:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 32:1'>32:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 32:17'>32:17</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 29:2'>29:2</a> <b>against all Egypt.</b> Cf. <a ref='Is 19'>Is 19</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 46:1–26'>Jer 46:1–26</a> . Egypt was to fall, even though it could be pictured as a water monster (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 29:3–5'>3–5</a> ), a towering tree like Assyria ( <a ref='Ezekiel 31:3'>31:3</a> ), a young lion ( <a ref='Ezekiel 32:2'>32:2</a> ), and a sea monster ( <a ref='Ezekiel 32:2–8'>32:2–8</a> ). The judgment looks ahead to 570 BC when the Greeks of Cyrene defeated Pharaoh (Apries) Hophra and 568/67 BC when Babylon conquered Egypt. <a ref='Ezekiel 29:3'>29:3</a> <b>great monster.</b> Most likely the crocodile is the figure used for the king. Crocodiles were worshiped by the Egyptians, and lived in their rivers. “Rahab” is a general term used for a monster which often symbolized Egypt. <i>See notes on <a ref='Psalms 87:4'>Pss 87:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:10'>89:10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 30:7'>Is 30:7</a> .</i> <a ref='Ezekiel 29:4'>29:4</a> <b>fish of your canals of the Nile.</b> This figuratively represents the people who followed Pharaoh and who were a part of God’s judgment on Egypt as a whole (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 29:5–6'>5–6a</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 29:6'>29:6</a> <b>a staff</b> made <b>of reed.</b> The Israelites had depended on Egyptians in military alliances as people lean on a staff that gives way, failing them.

Tyrians retreated to an island bastion out in the sea and survived, not giving Babylon full satisfaction in spoils (“wages”) equal to such long struggle. <a ref='Ezekiel 29:19'>29:19</a> <b>I will give the land of Egypt.</b> To make up for Babylon’s lack of sufficient reward from Tyre, God allowed a Babylonian conquest of Egypt in 568/67 BC.

Although mighty for a time on earth, the fallen lie as defeated equals in death, all conquered by God and consigned to eternal hell (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 32:21'>21</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 32:31–32'>32:31–32</a> <b>Pharaoh … comforted.</b> A strange comfort coming from the recognition that he and his people were not alone in misery and doom. <a ref='Ezekiel 33:1–33'>33:1–33</a> <b>the word … came.</b> This chapter is a transition between God’s judgments against Jerusalem and the nations (chaps. <a ref='Eze 1-32'>1–32</a> ), and Israel’s bright future when she is restored to her land (chaps. <a ref='Eze 34-48'>34–48</a> ). It provided God’s instructions for national repentance, and is thus the preface to the prophecies of comfort and salvation which follow (chaps. <a ref='Eze 34-39'>34–39</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 33:2–20'>33:2–20</a> <b>speak to … your people.</b> This was given to prepare the exiles’ minds to look on the awful calamity in Jerusalem as a just act by God (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 14:21–23'>14:21–23</a> ). He had faithfully warned, but they did not pay heed. Ezekiel had been forbidden to speak to his people from <a ref='Ezekiel 24:26–27'>24:26–27</a> , until Jerusalem was captured. Meanwhile, he had spoken to the foreign nations (chaps. <a ref='Eze 25-32'>25–32</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 33:2–9'>33:2–9</a> <b>watchman.</b> Such men as Jeremiah and Ezekiel (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:16–21'>3:16–21</a> ) were spiritual watchmen ( <a ref='Ezekiel 33:7–9'>33:7–9</a> ), warning that God would bring a sword on His people so that they had opportunity to prepare and be safe. This analogy came from the custom of putting guards on the city wall watching for the approach of danger, then trumpeting the warning. For the function of a watchman, cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 18:24–25'>2Sa 18:24–25</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 9:17'>2Ki 9:17</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 4:5'>Jer 4:5</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 6:1'>6:1</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 8:1'>Hos 8:1</a> ; <a ref='Amos 3:6'>Am 3:6</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 2:1'>Hab 2:1</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 33:4'>33:4</a> <b>his blood … on his</b> own <b>head.</b> Once the watchman did his duty, the responsibility passed to each person. <i>See the notes on chap. <a ref='Eze 18'>18</a></i> , where each person is accountable for his own response to God’s warnings, whether to die in judgment or to live as one who heeded and repented. Ezekiel had been a very faithful and obedient “watchman.” <a ref='Ezekiel 33:8–9'>33:8–9</a> <b>his blood I will require.</b> A prophet who sounded the warning of repentance for sin was not to be judged (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 33:9'>9</a> ), but the one who failed to deliver the message was held accountable (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 33:8'>8</a> ). This referred to unfaithfulness on the part of the prophet for which he bore responsibility and was chastened by God. <i>See the notes on chap. <a ref='Eze 18'>18</a> and <a ref='Acts 20:26'>Ac 20:26</a> .</i> <a ref='Ezekiel 33:10–11'>33:10–11</a> <b>how then can we live?</b> The Israelites reasoned that if they were liable to death in judgment that was inevitable, they were in a hopeless condition and had no future. God replied that He had no pleasure in seeing the wicked go into death for their sin, but desired them to repent and live (cf. <a ref='2 Peter 3:9'>2Pe 3:9</a> ). The divine answer to the human question is “Repent and be saved!” (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 18:23'>18:23</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 18:30–32'>30–32</a> ). Here was a blending of compassion with the demands of God’s holiness. Repentance and forgiveness were offered to all. <a ref='Ezekiel 33:12–20'>33:12–20</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Ezekiel 18:19–29'>18:19–29</a> .</i> One of the basic principles of God’s dealing with His people is presented here: judgment is according to personal faith and conduct. The discussion is not about eternal salvation and eternal death, but physical death in judgment for sin which, for believers, could not result in eternal death. The righteous behavior in v. <a ref='Ezekiel 33:15'>15</a> could only characterize a true believer, who was faithful from the heart. There is no distinction made as to the matter of who is a true believer in God. There is only a discussion of the issue of behavior as a factor in physical death. For those who were apostate idolaters, physical death would lead to eternal death. For believers who were lovers of the true God, their sin would lead only to physical punishment (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 11:28–31'>1Co 11:28–31</a> ; <a ref='1 John 5:16–17'>1Jn 5:16–17</a> ). “Righteous” and “wicked” are terms describing behavior, not one’s position before God. It is not the “righteousness of God” imputed as illustrated in the case of Abraham ( <a ref='Genesis 15:6'>Ge 15:6</a> ; <a ref='Romans 4:3–5'>Ro 4:3–5</a> ), but rather one’s deeds that are in view (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 33:15–19'>15–19</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 33:17'>33:17</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 33:20'>20</a> <b>not right.</b> They blamed God for their calamities when actually they were being judged for their sins. <a ref='Ezekiel 33:21'>33:21</a> <b>The city has been struck down.</b> A fugitive or fugitives (the Hebrew could be a collective noun) who escaped from Jerusalem reached Ezekiel with the report on Jan. 8, 585 BC, almost 6 months after the fall on July 18, 586 ( <a ref='Jeremiah 39:1–2'>Jer 39:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 52:5–7'>52:5–7</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 24:1–2'>Ezekiel 24:1–2</a> and <a ref='Ezekiel 33:21'>33:21</a> show a 36-month span from the outset of the siege on Jan. 15, 588, to the report in <a ref='Ezekiel 33:21'>33:21</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 33:22'>33:22</a> <b>opened my mouth.</b> God exercised control over the mouth of Ezekiel ( <i>see note on <a ref='Ezekiel 3:26–27'>3:26–27</a></i> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 33:23–29'>33:23–29</a> There is no date attached to the prophecies from <a ref='Ezekiel 33:23–39:29'>33:23—39:29</a> , but the first message after the fall of Jerusalem was a rebuke of Israel’s carnal confidence. This prophecy was against the remnant of Judah who remained in the Land of Promise after the fall of Jerusalem. Ezekiel warns the survivors that more judgment will come on them if they do not obey God. By some strange reasoning, they thought that if God had given the Land to Abraham when he was alone, it would be more securely theirs because they were many in number, a claim based on quantity rather than quality (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 33:24'>24</a> ). But judgment will come if they turn and reject God again (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 33:25–29'>25–29</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 33:30–33'>33:30–33</a> Here was a message to exiles, who had no intention of obeying the prophet’s messages. They liked to listen, but not apply the prophet’s words. They finally knew by bitter experience that he had spoken the truth of God. The people appreciated the eloquence of Ezekiel, but not the reality of his message. <a ref='Ezekiel 34:1'>34:1</a> From this chapter on, Ezekiel’s messages are mostly comforting, telling of God’s grace and faithfulness to His covenant promises. <a ref='Ezekiel 34:2'>34:2</a> <b>prophesy against the shepherds.</b> The reference was to preexilic leaders such as kings, priests, and prophets, i.e., false ones who fleeced the flock for personal gain (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 34:3–4'>3–4</a> ) rather than fed or led righteously (as <a ref='Ezekiel 22:25–28'>22:25–28</a> ; <a ref='Je 14'>Jer 14</a> , <a ref='Je 23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Zec 11'>Zec 11</a> ). This stands in contrast to Yahweh as Shepherd in <a ref='Ps 23'>Pss 23</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 80:1'>80:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 40:11'>Is 40:11</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 31:10'>Jer 31:10</a> ; <a ref='Luke 15:4–5'>Lk 15:4–5</a> ; <a ref='John 10:1'>Jn 10:1ff.</a> <a ref='Ezekiel 34:5'>34:5</a> <b>food for every beast.</b> The beast pictured nations that prey on Israel (cf. <a ref='Daniel 7:3–7'>Da 7:3–7</a> ), though it could possibly include actual wild beasts, as in <a ref='Ezekiel 14:21'>14:21</a> . Cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 34:25'>34:25</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 34:28'>28</a> and <i>see notes there</i> . <a ref='Ezekiel 34:9–10'>34:9–10</a> This was no idle threat, as proven by the case of King Zedekiah (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 52:10–11'>Jer 52:10–11</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 34:11'>34:11</a> <b>I … will seek.</b> God, the true Shepherd, would search out and find His sheep in order to restore Israel to their land for the kingdom which the Messiah leads (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 34:12–14'>12–14</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 34:12'>34:12</a> <b>a cloudy and gloomy day.</b> This refers to the “day of Yahweh” judgment on Israel (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 30:4–7'>Jer 30:4–7</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 34:12–14'>34:12–14</a> Here is the promise of a literal regathering and restoration of the people of Israel to their own land from their worldwide dispersion. Since the scattering was literal, the regathering must also be literal. Once they are regathered in Messiah’s kingdom, they will no longer want (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 34:15–16'>15–16</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 34:15–16'>34:15–16</a> <b>I will shepherd My flock.</b> In contrast to self-indulgent leaders who took advantage of the sheep, God will meet the needs of His sheep (people). This is clearly reminiscent of <a ref='Ps 23'>Ps 23</a> and will be fulfilled by the Good Shepherd ( <a ref='John 10:1'>Jn 10:1ff.</a> ), who will reign as Israel’s Shepherd. <a ref='Ezekiel 34:17–22'>34:17–22</a> <b>judge between.</b> Once He has judged the leaders, God will also judge the abusive members of the flock as to their true spiritual state. This passage anticipates the judgment of the people given by Jesus Christ in <a ref='Matthew 25:31–46'>Mt 25:31–46</a> . The ungodly are known because they trample the poor. Yahweh alone is able to sort out the true from the false (cf. parables of <a ref='Mt 13'>Mt 13</a> ), and will do so in the final kingdom. <a ref='Ezekiel 34:23'>34:23</a> <b>one shepherd … David.</b> This refers to the greater One in David’s dynasty (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 7:12–16'>2Sa 7:12–16</a> ), the Messiah, who will be Israel’s ultimate king over the millennial kingdom ( <a ref='Ezekiel 37:24–26'>37:24–26</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 30:9'>Jer 30:9</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 3:5'>Hos 3:5</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:9'>Zec 14:9</a> ).

This speaks of the ultimate salvation of Israel as in <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 35:2'>35:2</a> <b>against Mount Seir.</b> Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 21:11–12'>Is 21:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 49:7–22'>Jer 49:7–22</a> ; <a ref='Amos 1:11–12'>Am 1:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Obadiah 1:1'>Obadiah</a> . This is another name for Edom (cf. v. <a ref='Ezekiel 35:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 32:3'>Ge 32:3</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 38:6'>38:6</a> ), also threatened with judgment in <a ref='Ezekiel 25:12–14'>25:12–14</a> ( <i>see notes there</i> ). Edom was considered Israel’s most inveterate and bitter enemy (cf. <a ref='Psalms 137:7'>Ps 137:7</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 1:2–5'>Mal 1:2–5</a> ) and was located east of the Arabah from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqabah. The main cities were Teman and Petra, now in ruins. <a ref='Ezekiel 35:3–4'>35:3–4</a> This prediction (cf. vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 35:6–9'>6–9</a> ) came to pass literally, first by Nebuchadnezzar and later in 126 BC by John Hyrcanus. There is no trace of Edomites now, though their desolate cities can be identified as predicted by Obadiah ( <a ref='Obadiah 1:18'>Ob 18</a> ) and Jeremiah ( <a ref='Jeremiah 49:13'>Jer 49:13</a> ). Cf. vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 35:6–9'>6–9</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 35:5'>35:5</a> <b>Because.</b> God will judge Edom because of 1) her perpetual enmity against Israel since Esau’s hatred of Jacob ( <a ref='Ge 25-28'>Ge 25–28</a> ), and 2) Edom’s spiteful bloodshed against the Israelites trying to escape the Babylonians in 586 BC. <a ref='Ezekiel 35:10'>35:10</a> <b>Because.</b> A further reason for Edom’s doom is her design to snatch control of the territory occupied by “two nations,” i.e., Israel (N) and Judah (S). They plotted to take over these nations for their own gain (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 35:12'>12</a> ), but were prevented and destroyed because “Yahweh was there.” <a ref='Ezekiel 35:11–12'>35:11–12</a> <b>anger … jealousy … contempt.</b> Here were more reasons for Edom’s destruction. <a ref='Ezekiel 35:13'>35:13</a> <b>you have magnified</b> yourselves <b>with your mouth against Me.</b> Still another reason for judgment was Edom’s proud ambitions that were really against God (cf. v. <a ref='Ezekiel 35:10'>10</a> , “although Yahweh was there”). <a ref='Ezekiel 35:15'>35:15</a> <b>As you delighted.</b> This final reason for doom was Edom’s joy over Israel’s calamity. <b>they will know.</b> The ultimate aim in Edom’s judgment is that “all the earth” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 35:14'>14</a> ) may know He is Yahweh and see His glory. Sadly, sinners find this out only in their own destruction. Cf. <a ref='Hebrews 10:31'>Heb 10:31</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 36:1'>36:1</a> This chapter presents the prerequisite regeneration which Israel must experience before they can nationally enter into the promised blessings. This chapter must be understood to speak of a literal Israel, a literal land, and a literal regeneration, leading to a literal kingdom under Messiah. <b>prophesy to the mountains.</b> Cf. vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:1'>1</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 36:4'>4</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 36:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 36:8'>8</a> . Ezekiel addresses Israel’s mountains, as symbolic of the whole nation. He promises: 1) to give these mountains again to dispersed Israel (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:12'>12</a> ); 2) to cause fruit to grow on them (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:8'>8</a> ); 3) to rebuild cities and to multiply people there (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:10'>10</a> ); and 4) to bless in a greater way than in the past (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:11'>11</a> ). This promise can only be fulfilled in future millennial blessing to Israel that she has not yet experienced, because it includes the salvation of the New Covenant (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:25–27'>25–27</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 36:29'>29</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 36:31'>31</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 36:33'>33</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 36:2–15'>36:2–15</a> This section continues the prophecy against Edom from chap. <a ref='Eze 35'>35</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 36:2'>36:2</a> <b>Because the enemy has spoken.</b> God will restore these areas to Israel which their enemies claim to possess (cf. <a ref='Genesis 12:7'>Ge 12:7</a> ). They will pay for their spite against Israel. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:7'>36:7</a> <b>I have sworn.</b> God testifies, as a formal pledge, that He will bring a turnabout in which the nations that seized the land will be shamed. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:8–15'>36:8–15</a> Israel’s land will be productive (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:8–9'>8–9</a> ), populated (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:10–11'>10–11</a> ), and peaceful (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:12–15'>12–15</a> ). These features will be fully realized in the Messiah’s kingdom. The return from Babylon was only a partial fulfillment and foreshadowing of the fullness to come in the future kingdom. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:16–19'>36:16–19</a> Ezekiel gives a backward look to underscore why Israel had suffered the past judgments by Yahweh. It was because the Jews had “defiled” their land by their sins that Yahweh purged it. He likened such a defilement to a menstrual condition (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:17'>17</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 36:20'>36:20</a> <b>they profaned My holy name.</b> Even in dispersion, Israelites tainted God’s honor in the sight of the heathen, who concluded that Yahweh of this exiled people was not powerful enough to keep them in their land. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:21–23'>36:21–23</a> <b>for My holy name.</b> Restoring Israel to the land that God pledged in covenant ( <a ref='Genesis 12:7'>Ge 12:7</a> ) will sanctify His great name, and move other peoples to “know that I am Yahweh.” This glory for God is the primary reason for Israel’s restoration (cf. v. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:32'>32</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 36:24'>36:24</a> <b>bring you into your own land.</b> God assured Israel that He will bring them out of other lands back to the Promised Land (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:24'>24</a> ), the very land from which He scattered them (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:20'>20</a> ). It is the same “land that I gave to your fathers” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:28'>28</a> ), a land distinct from those of other nations (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:36'>36</a> ), and a land whose cities will be inhabited by those who return (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:33'>33</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 36:36'>36</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 36:38'>38</a> ). The establishment of the modern state of Israel indicates this has initially begun. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:25–27'>36:25–27</a> <b>I will cleanse you.</b> Along with the physical reality of a return to the land, God pledged spiritual renewal: 1) cleansing from sin; 2) a new heart of the New Covenant (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer 31:31–34</a> ); 3) a new spirit or disposition inclined to worship Him; and 4) His Spirit dwelling in them, enabling them to walk in obedience to His Word. This has not happened, because Israel has not trusted Jesus Christ as Messiah and Savior, but it will before the kingdom of Messiah (cf. <a ref='Zec 12-14'>Zec 12–14</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:13'>Rev 11:13</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 36:25–31'>36:25–31</a> This section is among the most glorious in all Scripture on the subject of Israel’s restoration to Yahweh and national salvation. This salvation is described in v. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:25'>25</a> as a cleansing that will wash away sin. Such washing was symbolized in the Mosaic rites of purification (cf. <a ref='Numbers 19:17–19'>Nu 19:17–19</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 119:9'>Ps 119:9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 4:4'>Is 4:4</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 13:1'>Zec 13:1</a> ). For the concept of sprinkling in cleansing, see <a ref='Psalms 51:7'>Ps 51:7</a> , <a ref='Psalms 51:10'>10</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:13'>Heb 9:13</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:22'>10:22</a> . This is the washing Paul wrote of in <a ref='Ephesians 5:26'>Eph 5:26</a> and <a ref='Titus 3:5'>Tit 3:5</a> . Jesus had this very promise in mind in <a ref='John 3:5'>Jn 3:5</a> . What was figuratively described in v. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:25'>25</a> is explained as literal in vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:26–27'>26–27</a> . The gift of the “new heart” signifies the new birth, which is regeneration by the Holy Spirit (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 11:18–20'>11:18–20</a> ). The “heart” stands for the whole nature. The “spirit” indicates the governing power of the mind which directs thought and conduct. A “heart of stone” is stubborn and self-willed. A “heart of flesh” is pliable and responsive. The evil inclination is removed and a new nature replaces it. This is New Covenant character as in <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer 31:31–34</a> . Yahweh will also give His “Spirit” to the faithful Jews (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 39:29'>39:29</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 44:3'>Is 44:3</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 59:21'>59:21</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:28–29'>Joel 2:28–29</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:16'>Ac 2:16ff.</a> ). When Israel becomes the true people of God (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:28'>28</a> ), the judgment promise of <a ref='Hosea 1:9'>Hosea 1:9</a> is nullified. All nature will experience the blessings of Israel’s salvation (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:29–30'>29–30</a> ). When the Jews have experienced such grace, they will be even more repentant—a sign of true conversion (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:31'>31</a> ). Ezekiel profoundly proclaims the doctrines of conversion and spiritual life.

The people knew about the doctrine of individual resurrection, otherwise this prophecy would have had no meaning (cf. <a ref='1Ki 17'>1Ki 17</a> ; <a ref='2Ki 4'>2Ki 4</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 13:21'>13:21</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 25:8'>Is 25:8</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 26:19'>26:19</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 12:2'>Da 12:2</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 13:14'>Hos 13:14</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 37:4–6'>37:4–6</a> <b>Prophesy over these bones.</b> Ezekiel is to proclaim God’s pledge to reassemble Israelites from the world and restore the nation of Israel to life (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:5'>5</a> ) and give them His Spirit (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:14'>14</a> ) in true salvation and spiritual life. Clearly, God is promising the resurrection of the nation of Israel and its spiritual regeneration (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:25–27'>36:25–27</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 37:7–10'>37:7–10</a> In the vision, Ezekiel did as he was told, and the dead bones became a living nation (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:10'>10</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 37:11–13'>37:11–13</a> This is the key to the interpretation of the vision.

This drama of uniting two sticks offered a second illustration that God will not only regather Israelites to their land, but will for the first time since 931 BC (the end of Solomon’s reign, <a ref='1 Kings 11:26–40'>1Ki 11:26–40</a> ) restore union between Israel and Judah (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:19'>19</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 37:21–22'>21–22</a> ) in the messianic reign (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:12–13'>Is 11:12–13</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 3:18'>Jer 3:18</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 1:11'>Hos 1:11</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 37:21–23'>37:21–23</a> God made 3 promises that summarized His future plans for Israel: 1) restoration, v. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:21'>21</a> ; 2) unification, v. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:22'>22</a> ; and 3) purification, v. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:23'>23</a> . These promises bring to fulfillment: 1) the Abrahamic Covenant (cf. <a ref='Ge 12'>Ge 12</a> ); 2) the Davidic Covenant ( <a ref='2Sa 7'>2Sa 7</a> ); and 3) the New Covenant (cf. <a ref='Je 31'>Jer 31</a> ), respectively. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:22'>37:22</a> <b>one king.</b> This leader (cf. vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:24–25'>24–25</a> ) is the Messiah-King-Shepherd often promised for David’s dynasty ( <a ref='Ezekiel 34:23–24'>34:23–24</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:5–8'>Jer 23:5–8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 30:9'>30:9</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 2:35'>Da 2:35</a> , <a ref='Daniel 2:45'>45</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 7:13–14'>7:13–14</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:27'>27</a> ), who is the one king of <a ref='Zechariah 14:9'>Zec 14:9</a> (cf. <a ref='Matthew 25:31'>Mt 25:31</a> , <a ref='Matthew 25:34'>34</a> , <a ref='Matthew 25:40'>40</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 37:23'>37:23</a> <b>cleanse them.</b> This is provided by the provisions of the New Covenant (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:27'>36:27</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 37:14'>37:14</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer 31:31–34</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 37:24–25'>37:24–25</a> <b>David.</b> This is to be understood as Jesus Christ the Messiah, descendant of David (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 7:8–17'>2Sa 7:8–17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 7:14'>Is 7:14</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 9:6–7'>9:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Micah 5:2'>Mic 5:2</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 1:1'>Mt 1:1</a> , <a ref='Matthew 1:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Luke 1:31–33'>Lk 1:31–33</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 37:25'>37:25</a> <b>land that I gave to Jacob.</b> It is natural to see this physical land, so clarified, as the very land God gave to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob ( <a ref='Genesis 12:7'>Ge 12:7</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 26:24'>26:24</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 35:12'>35:12</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 37:26'>37:26</a> <b>covenant of peace.</b> Cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 34:25'>34:25</a> . This is the New Covenant in full force. Israel has never yet been in a state of perpetual salvation peace; this awaits fulfillment in the future kingdom of the Messiah who is the “Prince of Peace” ( <a ref='Isaiah 9:6'>Is 9:6</a> ). <b>an everlasting covenant.</b> The everlasting nature of the Abrahamic (cf. <a ref='Genesis 17:7'>Ge 17:7</a> ), Davidic ( <a ref='2 Samuel 23:5'>2Sa 23:5</a> ), and New ( <a ref='Jeremiah 50:5'>Jer 50:5</a> ) Covenants are joined together in the redeemed who experience the millennial kingdom “forever” (used 4 times in vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:25–28'>25–28</a> ). The Hebrew word for “everlasting” may refer to a long time or eternity. It is also true that these covenants will continue to be fulfilled after the Millennium in the eternal state. <b>My sanctuary.</b> The Spirit of God begins to prepare for the great reality that God will have a sanctuary in the midst of His people and will dwell with them (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 6:12–13'>Zec 6:12–13</a> ). God promised to dwell with man on earth ( <a ref='Ezekiel 47:1–12'>47:1–12</a> ). This has been God’s desire in all epochs: 1) before Moses ( <a ref='Genesis 17:7–8'>Ge 17:7–8</a> ); 2) in the Mosaic era ( <a ref='Leviticus 26:11–13'>Lv 26:11–13</a> ); 3) in the church era ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:16'>1Co 3:16</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:19'>6:19</a> ); 4) in the Millennium ( <a ref='Ezekiel 37:26–28'>Eze 37:26–28</a> ); and 5) in eternity future ( <a ref='Revelation 21:3'>Rev 21:3</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 37:27'>37:27</a> Paul quotes this in <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:16'>2Co 6:16</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 38:1–39:29'>38:1—39:29</a> These chapters tell of a coming northern confederacy of nations who will invade the Promised Land. <a ref='Ezekiel 38:2'>38:2</a> <b>toward Gog.</b> This name is found in <a ref='1 Chronicles 5:4'>1Chr 5:4</a> . The LXX used “Gog” to render names such as Agag ( <a ref='Numbers 24:7'>Nu 24:7</a> ) and Og ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 3:1'>Dt 3:1</a> ), possibly showing that though it was a proper name, it came to be used as a general title for an enemy of God’s people. “Gog” most likely carries the idea “high” or “supreme one,” based on the comparison in <a ref='Numbers 24:7'>Nu 24:7</a> . It refers to a person, described as a “prince” from the land of Magog, who is the final Antichrist. <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 20:8'>Rev 20:8</a></i> , where Gog and Magog are referred to again. These titles are used there symbolically of the final world uprising against Jerusalem, its people and Messiah King. This attack comes not just from the north but the 4 corners of the world, as a world of sinners at the end of the 1,000-year kingdom come to fight the saints in the “beloved city” of Jerusalem. On that occasion, there is only one weapon used—divine fire. This is the climax to the last battle with Satan and his armies, whose eternal destiny is set. It is followed by the final judgment of all the ungodly before Yahweh ( <a ref='Revelation 20:11–15'>Rev 20:11–15</a> ) and the creation of the eternal, sinless state ( <a ref='Revelation 21:1'>Rev 21:1</a> ). <i>See notes on chap. <a ref='Eze 39'>39</a> .</i> <b>Magog.</b> Some see this people as derived from Japheth ( <a ref='Genesis 10:2'>Ge 10:2</a> ), later called the Scythians. Others propose a people in southeast Anatolia, later known as Asiatic people such as the Mongols and Huns. Others see Magog as an overall term for barbarians, north of Israel, around the Caspian and Black Seas. <b>chief prince of Meshech and Tubal.</b> Is translated “chief prince of Meshech and Tubal” because: 1) Rosh (more than 600 times) in the Hebrew OT is an adjective, “chief,” often in references to the “chief priest” ( <a ref='2 Kings 25:18'>2Ki 25:18</a> ); 2) most ancient versions took it to mean “chief” or “head”; and 3) in all places other than chaps. <a ref='Eze 38'>38</a> and <a ref='Eze 39'>39</a> where both Meshech and Tubal are mentioned, Rosh is not listed as a third people ( <a ref='Ezekiel 27:13'>27:13</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 32:26'>32:26</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 10:2'>Ge 10:2</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 1:5'>1Chr 1:5</a> ). This is also descriptive of the Antichrist, who rises to world dominance in the coming time of tribulation (cf. <a ref='Daniel 9:24–27'>Da 9:24–27</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 11:36–45'>11:36–45</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:1–17'>Rev 13:1–17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:20'>19:20</a> ). <b>Meshech and Tubal.</b> Two peoples were recognized in ancient Assyrian monuments: one called Mushki (Mushku) and the other Tubali (Tabal). Both were in Asia Minor, the area of Magog, modern-day Turkey. Summing up, a chief prince, who is the enemy of God’s people, will lead a coalition of nations against Jerusalem. The details of this enemy force and its destruction are given by Ezekiel in the rest of chaps. <a ref='Eze 38-39'>38–39</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 38:4'>38:4</a> <b>I will bring you out.</b> Just as God used Assyria ( <a ref='Is 8'>Is 8</a> ) and Babylon ( <a ref='Ezekiel 21:19'>21:19</a> ) as human invaders for His judgments, He aims to use this army. In this case, He brings the invader to Palestine so that He may visit judgment (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 38:8'>8</a> ) on the invader itself ( <a ref='Ezekiel 38:18–23'>38:18–23</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 39:1–10'>39:1–10</a> ). He thus uses the language of hooks in the jaws, as in judging Egypt ( <a ref='Ezekiel 29:4'>29:4</a> ). From the aggressors’ perspective, they think that it is their plan only to seize the spoil which draws them to Palestine (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 38:11–12'>11–12</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 38:5'>38:5</a> <b>Persia, Ethiopia, and Put.</b> The invasion involves a coalition of powers from the east and south of Palestine. Persia is modern Iran, Libya is in north Africa, west of Egypt; and Ethiopia is south of Egypt. <a ref='Ezekiel 38:6'>38:6</a> <b>Gomer.</b> Today the area is Armenia, which also was known as Cappadocia, having a people called Gomer in Assyrian inscriptions. <b>Beth-togarmah.</b> Today’s eastern Turkey ( <i>see note on <a ref='Ezekiel 27:14'>27:14</a></i> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 38:7–8'>38:7–8</a> This is the great time of Israel’s cleansing, salvation, and spiritual life (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 39:22'>39:22</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 39:27–28'>27–28</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–13:9'>Zec 12:10—13:9</a> ), getting them ready for Messiah’s return and kingdom ( <a ref='Zec 14'>Zec 14</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 38:8'>38:8</a> <b>in the last years.</b> In the context of Israel’s restoration ( <a ref='Eze 34-39'>Eze 34–39</a> ), the invader will make its final bid for the land. <b>restored from the sword.</b> This refers to Israelites who have been returned to their land, after the sword had killed or scattered many of their people. The Hebrew word for “restored” means “to return” ( <a ref='Genesis 40:13'>Ge 40:13</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 41:13'>41:13</a> ). <b>gathered.</b> This word also frequently refers to God’s final regathering of Israel ( <a ref='Ezekiel 37:21'>37:21</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:12'>Is 11:12</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 43:5'>43:5</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 32:37'>Jer 32:37</a> ). It has begun historically and will continue until the latter days. In the final millennial kingdom, there will occur the full and spiritual regathering, when all Israel is saved to enter their promised kingdom (cf. <a ref='Zec 12-14'>Zec 12–14</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ). <b>living securely.</b> This term occurs in several contexts devoted to the Israelites’ blessed estate after God has brought them back to their land ( <a ref='Ezekiel 28:26'>28:26</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 34:25'>34:25</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 34:28'>28</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 39:26'>39:26</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 32:37'>Jer 32:37</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:11'>Zec 14:11</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 38:9'>38:9</a> <b>And you will go up.</b> The time of the invasion is best understood as the end of the future tribulation period of 7 years. Israel will have been under a false peace in treaty with the Antichrist ( <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>Da 9:27</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 11:22'>11:22</a> , <a ref='Daniel 11:24'>24</a> ), before he turns on them in the “abomination of desolation” ( <a ref='Matthew 24:15'>Mt 24:15</a> ; cf. <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>Da 9:27</a> ). The false peace will end in hostility lasting to the completion of the 7 years ( <a ref='Zechariah 14:1–3'>Zec 14:1–3</a> ). When this final war occurs (cf. <a ref='Revelation 16:12–16'>Rev 16:12–16</a> ), Christ will ultimately conquer the beast, the false prophet, and all the ungodly forces ( <a ref='Revelation 19:11–21'>Rev 19:11–21</a> ) in order to establish His millennial kingdom ( <a ref='Revelation 20:1–10'>Rev 20:1–10</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 38:10–13'>38:10–13</a> This describes the peace in Israel during the period of Antichrist’s short-lived treaty with them ( <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>Da 9:27</a> ) in the first half of Daniel’s 70th week. References to “unwalled villages” refer to that period of 3 1/2 when Israel is secure under the protection of the world-ruling “prince that shall come,” called Antichrist (cf. <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>Da 9:27</a> ). After Antichrist turns on Israel, there is an escalation of hostility until the end of the 7-year time when this great force comes to plunder Jerusalem and the Promised Land (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 38:12'>12</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 38:12'>38:12</a> <b>to capture spoil … plunder.</b> Antichrist takes over the world for his own power and possession.

Even Daniel ( <a ref='Daniel 2:41–44'>Da 2:41–44</a> ) referred to this time at least 3 decades prior to <a ref='Eze 38'>Eze 38</a> .

He will further decimate the ranks by pestilence, a deluge of rain, large hailstones, plus fire and brimstone.

Further, people in the whole land help in the interment, which consumes 7 months. The description fits the time after Christ’s Second Advent extending into the millennial era as those who go into His kingdom do the work (cf. <a ref='Revelation 20:1–10'>Rev 20:1–10</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 39:11'>39:11</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 39:16'>16</a> <b>Hamon-gog.</b> Lit. “the multitude of Gog.” In v. <a ref='Ezekiel 39:16'>16</a> , a city in the area will be named Hamonah, “multitude” (cf. a similar idea in <a ref='Joel 3:14'>Joel 3:14</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 39:17–20'>39:17–20</a> <b>Say to … bird and … beast.</b> God’s word summons carrion birds and carnivorous animals to consume the fallen flesh as described in <a ref='Revelation 19:21'>Rev 19:21</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 39:17–18'>39:17–18</a> <b>My sacrifice.</b> Since God describes the feast by the imagery of a sacrificial meal, the warriors who fell (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 39:19'>19</a> ) are described figuratively in words such as rams and other animals used in sacrifice. <a ref='Ezekiel 39:21–29'>39:21–29</a> <b>I will put My glory.</b> God vanquishes Israel’s foes to show His glory so that His enemies and Israel will all know that He is Yahweh (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 39:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 39:22'>22</a> ). This is Israel’s salvation spoken of in <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–13:9'>Zec 12:10—13:9</a> and <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 39:29'>39:29</a> <b>poured out My Spirit.</b> God’s provision of His Spirit at the Second Advent complements the regathering (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:27'>36:27</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 37:14'>37:14</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:28'>Joel 2:28</a> ). The Gog and Magog assault in <a ref='Revelation 20:7–9'>Rev 20:7–9</a> at the end of the Millennium is another assault on Jerusalem patterned after certain images of the invasion here (chaps. <a ref='Eze 38-39'>38–39</a> ), but it is a distinct event one thousand years after the millennial kingdom begins. <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 20:8–9'>Rev 20:8–9</a> .</i> <a ref='Ezekiel 40:1–48:35'>40:1—48:35</a> Following this great battle at the end of the time of tribulation, this section provides explicit details concerning Christ’s millennial reign which follows, giving more detail about the 1,000-year kingdom than all other OT prophecies put together. It is the “Holy of Holies” among millennial forecasts. As has been done with the previous 39 chapters, this concluding portion will also be approached in a literal, historical manner which best serves the interpreter in all Scripture. In many ways these chapters are the most important in the book since they form the crowning reality, the climax of Ezekiel’s prophecy and Israel’s restoration. The section includes: 1) the new temple ( <a ref='Ezekiel 40:1–43:12'>40:1—43:12</a> ); 2) the new worship ( <a ref='Ezekiel 43:13–46:24'>43:13—46:24</a> ); and 3) the new apportionment of the Land ( <a ref='Ezekiel 47:1–48:35'>47:1—48:35</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 40:1'>40:1</a> <b>the twenty-fifth year.</b> 573 BC, in the first month of the ecclesiastical year, Nisan. The tenth day was the start of preparations for Passover. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:2'>40:2</a> <b>In the visions of God He brought me.</b> <a ref='Eze 40-48'>Ezekiel 40–48</a> narrates another vision, as did <a ref='Ezekiel 1:1–3:27'>1:1—3:27</a> ; <a ref='Eze 8-11'>8–11</a> ; and <a ref='Ezekiel 37:1–14'>37:1–14</a> . The characterization of the prophecy as a vision in no way detracts from its literal reality any more than Ezekiel’s visions of Jerusalem’s sins, idolatry, and destruction did. <b>into the land of Israel.</b> The vision pertains to Israel, as did chaps. <a ref='Eze 1-24'>1–24</a> , <a ref='Eze 33-39'>33–39</a> . <b>a very high mountain.</b> The mountain is not named; however, it is most likely Mt. Zion (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 17:22'>17:22</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 20:40'>20:40</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 2:2'>Is 2:2</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:1'>Mic 4:1</a> ), lifted up from its surroundings by a great earthquake ( <a ref='Zechariah 14:4–5'>Zec 14:4–5</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 14:10'>10</a> ). <b>structure like a city.</b> God will be explaining details relating to Israel’s spiritual future (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:2'>2</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 40:4'>4</a> ), so this must be the temple in particular and Jerusalem in general. This new and glorious temple will stand in contrast to the desecration and destruction of Solomon’s temple (chaps. <a ref='Eze 8-11'>8–11</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 40:3'>40:3</a> <b>a man.</b> An angel conducted a tour of all the details shown to the prophet, appearing in the form of a man (e.g., <a ref='Ge 18'>Ge 18</a> ; <a ref='Eze 9'>Eze 9</a> ), appearing like bright, gleaming bronze. He could be understood as the angel of Yahweh since he is called “Yahweh” ( <a ref='Ezekiel 44:2'>44:2</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 44:5'>5</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Exodus 3:2'>Ex 3:2</a></i> ). His “line of flax” was for larger measurements, the “rod” for shorter ones (cf. <a ref='Revelation 11:1'>Rev 11:1</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 21:15'>21:15</a> ). In each case God measured what belongs to Him. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:4'>40:4</a> <b>Declare … all that you are seeing.</b> <a ref='Eze 1-24'>Ezekiel 1–24</a> refers to Israel’s historical removal from her land; chaps. <a ref='Eze 25-32'>25–32</a> to historical judgments against other nations; chap. <a ref='Eze 33'>33</a> to a historical call to repentance and the fall of Jerusalem. So in chaps. <a ref='Eze 34-39'>34–39</a> , Israel’s literal, future return to the same land as a reversal of the historical dispersion is the most natural way to interpret the chapters. <a ref='Eze 38-39'>Ezekiel 38–39</a> describe a future, historical invasion of Israel and its aftermath during the time just before Messiah’s return. Therefore, chaps. <a ref='Eze 40-48'>40–48</a> would then be thought to continue the historical, prophetic pattern, describing the millennial conditions after Messiah comes and destroys the ungodly ( <a ref='Revelation 19:11'>Rev 19:11ff.</a> ), under which Israel will live and worship. Believing Gentiles will also be in the kingdom as sheep of the Great Shepherd (cf. <a ref='Matthew 25:31–46'>Mt 25:31–46</a> ), while all unbelievers are destroyed. Ezekiel is to write down all the details. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:5'>40:5</a> <b>a wall on the outside.</b> This outer wall is later described as a separation of the holy areas ( <a ref='Ezekiel 42:20'>42:20</a> ). <b>the house</b> of Yahweh <b>.</b> See <a ref='1Ki 6-7'>1Ki 6–7</a> to compare with details of Solomon’s temple. This could not be the heavenly temple since Ezekiel was taken to Israel to see it (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:2'>2</a> ). It could not be Zerubbabel’s temple since the glory of God was not present then. It could not be the eternal temple since Yahweh and the Lamb are its temple (cf. <a ref='Revelation 21:22'>Rev 21:22</a> ). Therefore, it must be the earthly millennial temple built with all of the exquisite details that are yet to be outlined. <b>measuring rod of six cubits. … handbreadth.</b> The rod extended 6 royal (long) cubits of 21 in. for a total of 10.5 ft., each cubit being made up of a standard width of 18 in. and a handbreadth of 3 in. Ezekiel’s Temple Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Ezekiel 40:6–7'>40:6–7</a> <b>the gate … east.</b> The buildings of the east gate are first because this will be in the direct line of approach to the temple. Each opening was 10.5 ft. across. Chambers (rooms) in the wall are 10.5 x 10.5 ft. Precise measurements describe a literal temple, not a symbolic one. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:8–16'>40:8–16</a> The chambers described here are accommodations for the ministering priests and temple officers who care for the temple. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:16'>40:16</a> <b>shuttered windows.</b> Since they had no glass, these are lattices (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 41:16–26'>41:16–26</a> ). <b>on</b> each <b>side pillar … palm tree ornaments.</b> These depict God’s desire for fruit in Israel. Palms are symbols of beauty, salvation, and triumph (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 14:16'>Zec 14:16ff.</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 7:9'>Rev 7:9</a> ). Palms are on the inner court’s side pillars as well (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:31'>31</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 40:17'>40:17</a> <b>the outer court.</b> This court is farthest out from the temple proper and enclosed by the outer walls. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:17–37'>40:17–37</a> Here is a further blueprint for the temple area, with more precise measurements. The numbers 5, 25, 50, and 100 are frequently used. The sanctuary formed a square of some 500 cubits. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:38–47'>40:38–47</a> This section describes “chambers” for the priests, and raises the question of sacrifices in the millennial kingdom. They will exist as vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:39–43'>39–43</a> indicate, but will be no more efficacious then than they were in OT times. No sacrifice before or after Christ saves. They only point to Him as the one true Lamb who takes away sin. The Lord’s Supper is a memorial that looks back to Calvary and in no way diminishes the cross. Israel rejected their Messiah, but when they have received Him and are in His kingdom, they will have a memorial of sacrifices that point to Him. They will have missed the memorial of the Lord’s Supper, but will then have their own memorial sacrifices for 1,000 years. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:39'>40:39</a> <b>burnt … sin … guilt offering.</b> For OT background see 1) <a ref='Leviticus 1:1–17'>Lv 1:1–17</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 6:8–13'>6:8–13</a> ; 2) <a ref='Leviticus 4:1–35'>Lv 4:1–35</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 6:24–30'>6:24–30</a> ; and 3) <a ref='Leviticus 5:1–6:7'>Lv 5:1—6:7</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 7:1–10'>7:1–10</a> respectively.

This Levitical family descended from Levi, Aaron, Eleazar, and Phinehas ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:3–8'>1Chr 6:3–8</a> ). In accord with God’s covenant with Phinehas ( <a ref='Numbers 25:10–13'>Nu 25:10–13</a> ), and because of Eli’s unfaithfulness (cf. <a ref='1Sa 1-2'>1Sa 1–2</a> ) and Zadok’s faithfulness to David and Solomon ( <a ref='1 Kings 1:32–40'>1Ki 1:32–40</a> ), Zadok’s sons serve as priests in the millennial temple. Other references to sons of Zadok are in <a ref='Ezekiel 43:19'>43:19</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 44:15'>44:15</a> and <a ref='Ezekiel 48:11'>48:11</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 40:47'>40:47</a> <b>measured the court.</b> The court around the temple was a square, around the square temple ( <a ref='Ezekiel 41:1'>41:1</a> ). <b>the altar.</b> This is the bronze altar where offerings occur.

This chapter can be studied in the light of <a ref='1Ki 6-7'>1Ki 6–7</a> to note differences from Solomon’s temple. <a ref='Ezekiel 41:4'>41:4</a> <b>the Holy of Holies.</b> The High Priest entered annually on the Day of Atonement (cf. <a ref='Le 16'>Lv 16</a> ). These dimensions are identical to Solomon’s ( <a ref='1 Kings 6:20'>1Ki 6:20</a> ), and twice those of the tabernacle in the wilderness. <a ref='Ezekiel 41:5–11'>41:5–11</a> This section describes the “wall” and “side chambers.” <a ref='Ezekiel 41:12'>41:12</a> <b>building … toward the west.</b> Beyond the western end of the temple proper was a distinct building with space that serves the temple, possibly housing supplies. <a ref='Ezekiel 41:13'>41:13</a> <b>measured the house.</b> Cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:47'>40:47</a> . It was about 175 ft. square. <a ref='Ezekiel 41:15'>41:15</a> <b>gallery on each side.</b> These were terraced buildings with decorations (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 41:18–20'>18–20</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 41:18'>41:18</a> <b>cherubim and palm trees.</b> Figures of angels (cf. chaps. <a ref='Eze 1'>1</a> , <a ref='Eze 10'>10</a> ) with palms between them (possibly to depict life and fruitfulness of God’s servants) were on the walls of the temple proper and on the doors (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 41:25'>25</a> ). Each cherub (unlike that of chaps. <a ref='Eze 1'>1</a> , <a ref='Eze 10'>10</a> which had 4 faces) had the face of a man and of a lion, possibly to represent the humanity and kingship of Messiah. <a ref='Ezekiel 41:22'>41:22</a> This was the altar of incense (cf. <a ref='Exodus 30:1–3'>Ex 30:1–3</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 7:48'>1Ki 7:48</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 42:3'>42:3</a> <b>gallery corresponding to gallery.</b> Priestly rooms are described (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 42:3–12'>3–12</a> ), situated along the south, north, and west walls of the sanctuary and Most Holy Place, in 3 stories. Priests eat the holy offerings (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 2:3'>Lv 2:3</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 2:10'>10</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 6:9–11'>6:9–11</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 10:12'>10:12</a> ) and dress there (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 42:13–14'>13–14</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 42:15–20'>42:15–20</a> <b>out by the way of the gate.</b> The angel measured the height and thickness of the outside wall ( <a ref='Ezekiel 40:5'>40:5</a> ); then the outer court ( <a ref='Ezekiel 40:6–27'>40:6–27</a> ); next the inner court with the chambers ( <a ref='Ezekiel 40:28–42:14'>40:28—42:14</a> ); finally, the extent of all the temple buildings outside. Measurements of the outer wall, 500 reeds each way, were approximately one mi. on each of the 4 sides. Much too large for Mt. Moriah, this scheme will require changes in the topography of Jerusalem, as Zechariah predicted ( <a ref='Zechariah 14:9–11'>14:9–11</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 43:2'>43:2</a> <b>the glory of the God of Israel.</b> In earlier chapters of this prophecy, emphasis was given to the departure of God’s glory from the temple (see chaps. <a ref='Eze 8-11'>8–11</a> ). Thus Yahweh abandoned His people to destruction and dispersion. Here, in the millennial temple, the glory of God returns to dwell. His glory will be manifest in fullness in the future kingdom, after Yahweh’s Second Advent, which is also to be glorious ( <a ref='Matthew 16:27'>Mt 16:27</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 25:31'>25:31</a> ). Verses <a ref='Ezekiel 43:1–12'>1–12</a> describe God’s glorious entrance into the sanctuary. <b>coming from … the east.</b> The glory had been in the tabernacle ( <a ref='Exodus 40:34–35'>Ex 40:34–35</a> ) and the temple ( <a ref='1 Kings 8:10–11'>1Ki 8:10–11</a> ), though not in Zerubbabel’s temple. Here, Yahweh returns to be Israel’s King. The glory departed to the east from Israel ( <a ref='Ezekiel 11:23'>11:23</a> ) when God judged them, so the glory returns from the east when He has regathered them, and is restoring their worship. <a ref='Ezekiel 43:3'>43:3</a> <b>like the vision.</b> This vision appearance of God to Ezekiel is glorious, just as the vision in chaps. <a ref='Eze 8-11'>8–11</a> , which pictures His coming, by angels, to judge Jerusalem (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 9:3–11'>9:3–11</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 10:4–7'>10:4–7</a> ). <b>like the vision … by the river Chebar.</b> God’s appearance is also glorious as in the vision of <a ref='Ezekiel 1:3–28'>1:3–28</a> . <b>I fell on my face.</b> Just as in the other visions of God’s glory ( <a ref='Ezekiel 1:28'>1:28</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 9:8'>9:8</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Revelation 1:12–17'>Rev 1:12–17</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 43:5'>43:5</a> <b>the glory … filled the house.</b> The future kingdom glory of God will fill His temple ( <a ref='Zechariah 2:5'>Zec 2:5</a> ), as He filled the tabernacle ( <a ref='Exodus 40:34'>Ex 40:34</a> ) and later Solomon’s temple ( <a ref='1 Kings 8:11'>1Ki 8:11</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 29:9'>Ps 29:9</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 43:7'>43:7</a> <b>the place of My throne.</b> The King of Glory ( <a ref='Psalms 24:7–10'>Ps 24:7–10</a> ) claims the millennial temple as His place to dwell.

There will be human, unresurrected people in the kingdom, who entered when Christ returned and destroyed all the wicked. They will worship at this actual temple. <a ref='Ezekiel 43:8–9'>43:8–9</a> The future temple will be most holy, protected from 1) harlotry such as the Israelites had engaged in ( <a ref='2 Kings 23:7'>2Ki 23:7</a> ) and 2) defiling tombs of kings that Israel had allowed in the sacred temple area ( <a ref='Ezekiel 20:18'>20:18</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 43:10–12'>43:10–12</a> Here is the key to the entire vision of chaps. <a ref='Eze 40-48'>40–48</a> . These glorious future plans show how much Israel forfeited by their sins. Every detail should produce repentance in Ezekiel’s hearers and readers. <a ref='Ezekiel 43:13–27'>43:13–27</a> <b>the altar.</b> The measurements of the altar of burnt offering are given in vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 43:13–17'>13–17</a> , then the offerings are described (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 43:18–27'>18–27</a> ). These offerings are not efficacious, nor were the OT sacrifices. They were all symbolic of death for sin. They do not take away sin (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 10:4'>Heb 10:4</a> ). They were prospective; these will be retrospective. <a ref='Ezekiel 43:19'>43:19</a> <b>seed of Zadok.</b> Cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:46'>40:46</a> and <a ref='Ezekiel 44:10'>44:10</a> , and <i>see notes there</i> . <b>a bull from the herd for a sin offering.</b> Exact offerings, in language just as definitive as the literal descriptions in Moses’ day, are also just as literal here. They are of a memorial nature; they are not efficacious any more than OT sacrifices were. As OT sacrifices pointed forward to Christ’s death, so these are tangible expressions, not competing with, but pointing back to the value of Christ’s completely effective sacrifice, once for all ( <a ref='Hebrews 9:28'>Heb 9:28</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:10'>10:10</a> ). God at that time endorsed OT offerings as tokens of forgiving and cleansing worshipers on the basis and credit of the great Lamb they pointed to, who alone could take away sins ( <a ref='John 1:29'>Jn 1:29</a> ). The tangible expressions of worship, which the Israelites for so long failed to offer validly (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 1:11–15'>Is 1:11–15</a> ), will at last be offered acceptably, then with full understanding about the Lamb of God to whom they point. The bread and the cup, which believers today find meaningful, do not compete with Christ’s cross but are tangible memorials of its glory. So will these sacrifices be. <a ref='Ezekiel 43:24'>43:24</a> <b>salt.</b> Cf. <a ref='Leviticus 2:13'>Lv 2:13</a> . <b>burnt offering.</b> As the sin offering is a part of future millennial worship (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 43:19'>19</a> ), so there are other offerings also (cf. <a ref='Le 1-7'>Lv 1–7</a> ). The burnt offering, denoting full consecration to God is one; the peace offering expressing gratitude for peace with God in covenant bonds is another (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 43:27'>27</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 43:25'>43:25</a> <b>without blemish.</b> Commemorative of Christ’s unblemished perfection. <a ref='Ezekiel 44:1–2'>44:1–2</a> <b>the outer gate … was shut.</b> Yahweh has returned from the direction in which He departed ( <a ref='Ezekiel 10:18–19'>10:18–19</a> ). It is kept closed, in honor of Yahweh’s glory having returned through it for the millennial worship and indicating that Yahweh will not depart again as in chaps. <a ref='Eze 8-11'>8–11</a> (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 43:1–5'>43:1–5</a> ). This eastern gate of the temple should not be confused with the modern sealed eastern gate of the city (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 45:6–8'>45:6–8</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 44:3'>44:3</a> <b>the prince … shall sit in it.</b> The designation “prince” is used at least 14 times in chaps. <a ref='Eze 44-47'>44–47</a> . He is not the Lord Jesus Christ, but someone distinct from Him (cf. “eat bread before Yahweh”); he has sins for which he offers sacrifice ( <a ref='Ezekiel 45:22'>45:22</a> ), and fathers sons ( <a ref='Ezekiel 46:16–18'>46:16–18</a> ). He cannot enter by the east gate which Yahweh used, but he is allowed to come in and go out by the gate’s vestibule, and eat bread by the gateway. He cannot perform priestly duties ( <a ref='Ezekiel 45:19'>45:19</a> ) as Messiah will (cf. <a ref='Psalms 110:4'>Ps 110:4</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 6:12–13'>Zec 6:12–13</a> ), and he must worship Yahweh ( <a ref='Ezekiel 46:2'>46:2</a> ). Most likely “the prince” is one who is neither a priest nor the king, but rather one who administrates the kingdom, representing the King (the Lord Jesus Christ) on one hand, and also the princes ( <a ref='Ezekiel 14:8–9'>14:8–9</a> ) who individually lead the 12 tribes. Possibly, he will be a descendant of David. <a ref='Ezekiel 44:5–9'>44:5–9</a> <b>set your heart on the entrance.</b> Since Yahweh’s glory fills the temple, it is sanctified (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 44:4'>4</a> ), and God is particular about what kind of people worship there. Sins of the past, as in chaps. <a ref='Eze 8-11'>8–11</a> , must not be repeated, and if they are they will exclude their perpetrators from the temple. Only the circumcised in heart may enter ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:6'>Dt 30:6</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 4:4'>Jer 4:4</a> ; <a ref='Romans 2:25–29'>Ro 2:25–29</a> ), whether of Israel or another nation (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 44:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 44:9'>9</a> ). Many other peoples than Jews will go into the kingdom in unresurrected bodies, because they have believed in Jesus Christ and were ready for His coming. They will escape His deadly judgment and populate and reproduce in the 1,000-year kingdom. Such circumcision pertains to a heart which is sincere about removing sin and being devoted to Yahweh (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 29:13'>Jer 29:13</a> ). In the Millennium, a Jew with an uncircumcised heart will be considered a foreigner (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 44:9'>9</a> ). “Uncircumcised in flesh” refers to sinners and “foreigners” identifies rejecters of the true God. <a ref='Ezekiel 44:10'>44:10</a> <b>Levites … shall bear the punishment for their iniquity.</b> God makes distinctions. Levites in the line of those unfaithful in days before the judgment can minister in temple services, but they cannot make offerings or enter the Most Holy Place (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 44:11–14'>11–14</a> ). Only Zadok’s line can fulfill these ministries (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 44:15–16'>15–16</a> ). The reason for this is the value which God attaches to the faithfulness of Zadok in the past ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:35'>1Sa 2:35</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 15:24'>2Sa 15:24ff.</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 1:32–40'>1Ki 1:32–40</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 2:26–35'>2:26–35</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Ezekiel 40:46'>40:46</a> .</i> <a ref='Ezekiel 44:16'>44:16</a> <b>My table.</b> This is the altar of burnt offering (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:46'>40:46</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 41:22'>41:22</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 44:17–27'>44:17–27</a> <b>it will be.</b> Various standards govern priestly service, such as moderation (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 44:20'>20</a> ) and sobriety (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 44:21'>21</a> ). They will model holy behavior as they teach the people to live their lives set apart to God (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 44:23–24'>23–24</a> ). Minutia about dress (such as forbidding the uncleanness of sweat resulting from wearing wool), marriage (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 21:14'>Lv 21:14</a> ), contact with dead bodies, etc. point more naturally to a literal fulfillment than to a generalized blurring of details in a symbolical interpretation. <a ref='Ezekiel 44:28–31'>44:28–31</a> <b>I am their possession.</b> As the priests had no possession in the Land when it was originally apportioned, so in the future God will be their portion. <a ref='Ezekiel 45:1–5'>45:1–5</a> <b>a contribution to Yahweh.</b> This sacred land, set apart at the heart (center) of Israel, is separate from allotments designated for various tribes, seven to the north and five to the south (cf. chap. <a ref='Eze 48'>48</a> ). Though the whole earth is Yahweh’s ( <a ref='Psalms 24:1'>Ps 24:1</a> ), this area is meaningful to Him in a special sense, as providing for special purposes which <a ref='Ezekiel 45:2–8'>45:2–8</a> goes on to define. This holy rectangle (8.5 mi. by 3.3 mi.) (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 45:1'>1</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 45:3'>3</a> ) corresponds to <a ref='Ezekiel 48:8–22'>48:8–22</a> , which describes this portion as between Judah to the north and Benjamin to the south extending from the Mediterranean east to the eastern border. It is the area for the priestly homes (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 45:4'>4</a> ) particularly, but is also for the benefit of all worshipers. <a ref='Ezekiel 45:2'>45:2</a> <b>for the holy place a square round.</b> At the heart of the special allotment is the temple area ( <a ref='Ezekiel 48:10'>48:10</a> ), which serves all Israelite tribes, and also is the worship center for those of the whole world, who visit ( <a ref='Isaiah 4:2–3'>Is 4:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:16–19'>Zec 14:16–19</a> ). It is one mi. square (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 42:15–20'>42:15–20</a> ). As a center, not only for those in Palestine but for the world, the area is appropriately larger than past temples that served Israel. <a ref='Ezekiel 45:5'>45:5</a> <b>for the Levites.</b> Distinct from the land devoted to temple and priestly homes is another portion for Levites, who assist in temple service. This portion is also about 8.5 x 3.3 mi. and lies north of the temple/priest allotment.

This warning shows that there will be sin in the Millennium. The believing Jews who entered the 1,000-year reign of Christ on earth and inherited the promised kingdom will be fully human and capable of such sins. There also will be children who do not necessarily believe, as the final rebellion against King Messiah and His temple proves (cf. <a ref='Revelation 20:7–9'>Rev 20:7–9</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 45:10'>45:10</a> <b>balances.</b> Relates to selling by weight. <b>ephah.</b> Relates to selling by dry volume. <b>bath.</b> Relates to selling by liquid volume. <a ref='Ezekiel 45:11'>45:11</a> <b>ephah.</b> About .75 bu. <b>bath.</b> About 6 gal. <b>homer.</b> In liquid volume about 60 gal. and in dry volume about 7.5 bu. <a ref='Ezekiel 45:12'>45:12</a> <b>shekel.</b> By weight about .4 oz. made up of 20 gerahs (.02 oz./each).

The millennial feasts include 3 of the 6 Levitical feasts: 1) Passover; 2) Unleavened Bread; and 3) Booths, or Tabernacles. Three Levitical feasts are not celebrated: 1) Pentecost; 2) Trumpets; and 3) Atonement. Most likely they are excluded because what they had looked forward to prophetically have been fulfilled and now serve no significant remembrance purpose such as Passover and Booths, or Tabernacle, will continue to provide. <a ref='Ezekiel 45:18–20'>45:18–20</a> <b>atonement.</b> The Day of Atonement is never mentioned, but God institutes a never-before-celebrated festival to start the “new year” with an emphasis on holiness in the temple. The first month, Abib, would be in Mar./Apr. The feast appears to last 7 days (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 45:20'>20</a> ). It indicates that there will be sin in the kingdom, committed by those who entered alive and their offspring. Millennial Feasts Levitical Millennial 1. N/A 1.

They continue on into the Millennium as a week-long feast of remembrance, which will serve much the same purpose then as the bread and cup do now (cf. <a ref='Ex 12-15'>Ex 12–15</a> for details). The 3 annual pilgrimage feasts with required attendance under Mosaic legislation were: 1) Unleavened Bread, 2) Pentecost, and 3) Booths, or Tabernacles (cf. <a ref='Exodus 23:14–17'>Ex 23:14–17</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 28:16–29:40'>Nu 28:16—29:40</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:1–17'>Dt 16:1–17</a> ). They have been modified with the 3 in <a ref='Ezekiel 45:18–25'>45:18–25</a> . Pentecost is replaced by the new feast of vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 45:18–20'>18–20</a> . There are also portion differences from the Mosaic law (cf. <a ref='Numbers 28:19–21'>Nu 28:19–21</a> ), plus the millennial offerings are richer and more abundant, in general. <a ref='Ezekiel 45:22–23'>45:22–23</a> <b>the prince.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Ezekiel 44:3'>44:3</a> .</i> Here he sacrifices for his own sin. <a ref='Ezekiel 45:24'>45:24</a> <b>hin.</b> About one gal. <a ref='Ezekiel 45:25'>45:25</a> The Feast of Booths, or Tabernacles, continues on into the Millennium as confirmed by <a ref='Zechariah 14:16–21'>Zec 14:16–21</a> . This would be a remembrance of God’s sustaining provision in the wilderness. The seventh month, Tishri, would be in Sep./Oct., and this feast will last for one week, as do the previous two. The prince (“he,” v. <a ref='Ezekiel 45:25'>25</a> ) once again offers sacrifice. <a ref='Ezekiel 46:1–15'>46:1–15</a> This section further discusses offerings and deals with: 1) Sabbath and New Moon (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 46:1–8'>1–8</a> ); 2) appointed feast days ( <a ref='Ezekiel 46:9–11'>9–11</a> ); 3) voluntary offerings (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 46:12'>12</a> ); and 4) daily sacrifices (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 46:13–15'>13–15</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Numbers 28:1–15'>Nu 28:1–15</a> for a summary of former Mosaic details. <a ref='Ezekiel 46:1'>46:1</a> <b>The gate … shall be shut.</b> Shutting the gate 6 days seems to serve the purpose of giving special distinction to the Sabbath and New Moon, when it is open and in use. Israel largely failed and was judged in ancient times in regard to these days ( <a ref='Jeremiah 17:22–27'>Jer 17:22–27</a> ; cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:21'>2Chr 36:21</a> ). The Sabbath will be reinstated for a restored and regenerated Israel. Note here that modern-day sabbatarians fail to realize that the Sabbath consisted of far more than just rest from labor, but included specific sacrifices. It is inconsistent to take one part of the Sabbath observance and discard the others. <a ref='Ezekiel 46:2'>46:2</a> <b>the prince.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Ezekiel 44:3'>44:3</a> .</i> He appears 5 times (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 46:2'>2</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 46:4'>4</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 46:8'>8</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 46:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 46:12'>12</a> ) in regard to sacrifices.

Rather, he enters and exits by the gate’s vestibule.

A gift to one of his sons is permanent (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 46:16'>16</a> ), but a gift to a servant lasts only to the year of Jubilee, the 50th year (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 25:10–13'>Lv 25:10–13</a> ), and then returns to him (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 46:17'>17</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 46:17'>46:17</a> <b>the year of liberty.</b> The year of Jubilee. <a ref='Ezekiel 46:18'>46:18</a> <b>the prince shall not take … inheritance.</b> As in <a ref='Ezekiel 45:8–9'>45:8–9</a> , the prince is not to confiscate others’ property to enlarge his own holdings, as often occurred in Israel’s history when rulers became rich by making others poor (cf. <a ref='1Ki 21'>1Ki 21</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 46:19–24'>46:19–24</a> <b>chambers.</b> The priests’ kitchen chambers are convenient for managing their parts of the offerings and cooking sacrificial meals for worshipers, possibly close to the inner east gate. The “ministers of the house” (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 46:24'>24</a> ) are not the priests, but temple servants. <a ref='Ezekiel 47:1–12'>47:1–12</a> This section reinforces the constant emphasis of the prophets that in the final kingdom amazing physical and geographical changes will occur on the earth, and especially the land of Israel. This chapter deals mainly with changes in the water. <a ref='Ezekiel 47:1–2'>47:1–2</a> <b>water was flowing … east.</b> A stream of water flows up from underneath the temple (cf. <a ref='Joel 3:18'>Joel 3:18</a> ), going east to the Jordan, then curving south through the Dead Sea area (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 47:7–8'>7–8</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 14:8'>Zechariah 14:8</a> refers to this stream as flowing from Jerusalem to the west (Mediterranean Sea) as well as to the east (Dead Sea). Its origin coincides with Christ’s Second Advent arrival on the Mt. of Olives (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 14:4'>Zec 14:4</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:11'>Ac 1:11</a> ), which will trigger a massive earthquake, thus creating a vast east-west valley running through Jerusalem and allowing for the water flow. <i>See note on <a ref='Zechariah 14:3–4'>Zec 14:3–4</a> .</i> <a ref='Ezekiel 47:3–5'>47:3–5</a> <b>he measured.</b> The escorting angel, wanting to reveal the size of the river, took Ezekiel, in the vision, to four different distances from the temple, where the stream was found to be at increasing depths until it was over his head. Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 35:1–7'>Is 35:1–7</a> , where the prophet says “the desert will … flourish … like the crocus.” <a ref='Ezekiel 47:7'>47:7</a> <b>very many trees.</b> Lush growth from the river. <a ref='Ezekiel 47:8'>47:8</a> <b>waters … will be healed.</b> The flow east, then south, runs into the Dead Sea and renders good the salty water (more than 6 times as salty as the sea) that formerly would not support life because of its high mineral content.

The fruit is for food, and the leaves serve a medicinal purpose, probably both in preventative and corrective senses. The fruit is perpetual, kept so by a continual and lavish supply of spring water from the temple. <a ref='Ezekiel 47:13–23'>47:13–23</a> <b>This</b> shall be <b>the boundary.</b> The picture is that of an enlarged Canaan for all to inhabit. The boundaries are substantially larger than those given to Moses in <a ref='Numbers 34:1–15'>Nu 34:1–15</a> . Israel, promised in God’s covenant with Abraham (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 47:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 12:7'>Ge 12:7</a> ), has specific geographical limits within which Israel will finally occupy tribal areas which differ from the occupation in Joshua’s day (cf. <a ref='Jos 13-22'>Jos 13–22</a> ). This is the complete fulfillment of the promise of the land in the Abrahamic Covenant. <a ref='Ezekiel 47:13'>47:13</a> <b>Joseph … two portions.</b> This is in keeping with the promise of Jacob to Joseph ( <a ref='Genesis 48:5–6'>Ge 48:5–6</a> , <a ref='Genesis 48:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 49:22–26'>49:22–26</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 47:15–20'>47:15–20</a> The borders of the millennial Promised Land are described 1) to the north (vv. <a ref='Ezekiel 47:15–17'>15–17</a> ); 2) to the east (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 47:18'>18</a> ); 3) to the south (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 47:19'>19</a> ); and 4) to the west (v. <a ref='Ezekiel 47:20'>20</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 47:22'>47:22</a> <b>bring forth sons.</b> This reminds us that children will be born all through the 1,000-year rule of Messiah. Not all will believe and be saved, as evidenced by the final rebellion (cf. <a ref='Revelation 20:8–9'>Rev 20:8–9</a> ). <a ref='Ezekiel 47:23'>47:23</a> <b>sojourner.</b> This provision is in keeping with <a ref='Leviticus 19:34'>Lv 19:34</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 48:1–7'>48:1–7</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 48:23–29'>23–29</a> <b>the tribes.</b> The land pledged to each tribe within the total area described in <a ref='Ezekiel 47:13–23'>47:13–23</a> fulfills God’s promises to actually restore Israel’s people from around the world to the Promised Land just as they were actually scattered from it ( <a ref='Ezekiel 28:25–26'>28:25–26</a> ; <a ref='Eze 34-37'>34–37</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 39:21–29'>39:21–29</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 31:33'>Jer 31:33</a> ). Dan is first mentioned.

Josephus, a Jewish historian, reported in the first century AD that Jerusalem was approximately 4 mi. in perimeter. <a ref='Ezekiel 48:35'>48:35</a> <b>the name.</b> The city is called YHWH Shammah, “Yahweh is there.” The departed glory of God (chaps. <a ref='Eze 8-11'>8–11</a> ) has returned ( <a ref='Ezekiel 44:1–2'>44:1–2</a> ), and His dwelling, the temple, is in the very center of the district given over to Yahweh. With this final note, all of the unconditional promises which God had made to Israel in the Abrahamic Covenant ( <a ref='Ge 12'>Ge 12</a> ); the Priestly Covenant ( <a ref='Nu 25'>Nu 25</a> ); the Davidic Covenant ( <a ref='2Sa 7'>2Sa 7</a> ); and the New Covenant ( <a ref='Je 31'>Jer 31</a> ) have been fulfilled. So this final verse provides the consummation of Israel’s history—the returned presence of God!",
