Since Paul’s initial converts were Jewish, he made it unmistakably clear that this “church” was not a Jewish assembly, but rather one which gathered in the name of Jesus, the Son of God ( Ac 17:2–3 ), who is both Lord God and Messiah. This emphasis on the equality between God and the Lord Jesus is a part of the introduction in all Paul’s epistles (cf. 1Jn 2:23 )."

No. There are none exact or even close. The only explicit reference to the Rapture in the Gospels is Jn 14:1–3 . Some suggest that Jesus had said the words while on earth, their substance being recorded later in such places as Mt 24:30–31 and Jn 6:39–40 ; 11:25–26 . Similarities between this passage in 1Th and the Gospel accounts include a trumpet ( Mt 24:31 ), a resurrection ( Jn 1:26 ), and a gathering of the elect ( Mt 24:31 ). Yet dissimilarities between it and the canonical sayings of Christ far outweigh the resemblances. Some of the differences between Mt 24:30–31 and vv. 15–17 are as follows: 1) in Mt the Son of Man is coming on the clouds (but see Mk 13:26 ; Lk 21:27 ), in 1Th ascending believers are in them; 2) in the former the angels gather, in the latter Christ does personally; 3) in the former nothing is said about resurrection, while in the latter this is the main theme; and 4) Matthew records nothing about the order of ascent, which is the principal lesson in Thessalonians. On the other hand, did he mean a statement of Jesus that was spoken but not recorded in the Gospels ( Ac 20:35 )? No. There is reason to conclude this since Paul affirmed that he taught the Rapture as a heretofore hidden truth ( 1Co 15:51 ), i.e., “mystery.” Apparently, the Thessalonians were informed fully about the day of the Lord judgment (cf. 5:1–2 ), but not the preceding event—the rapture of the church. Until Paul revealed it as the revelation from God to him, it had been a secret, with the only prior mention being Jesus’ teaching in Jn 14:1–3 . This was new revelation of what had previously been an unrevealed mystery. we who are alive and remain. This refers to Christians alive at the time of the Rapture, those who live on this earth to see the coming of the Lord for His own. Since Paul didn’t know God’s timing, he lived and spoke as if it could happen in his lifetime. As with all early Christians, he believed the event was near (cf. Ro 13:11 ; 1Co 6:14 ; 10:11 ; 16:22 ; Php 3:20–21 ; 1Ti 6:14 ; Tit 2:13 ). Those alive at the Rapture will follow those dead who rise first (v. 16 )."

Jn 10:28 ; Ac 8:39 ). This passage, along with Jn 14:1–3 and 1Co 15:51–52 , forms the biblical basis for “the Rapture” of the church. The time of the Rapture cannot be conclusively determined from this passage alone. However, when other texts such as Rev 3:10 and Jn 14:3 are consulted and compared to the texts about Christ’s coming in judgment ( Mt 13:34–50 ; 24:29–44 ; Rev 19:11–21 ) at the end of a 7-year tribulation, it has to be noted that there is a clear difference between the character of the “Rapture” in that there is no mention of any judgment, while the other texts feature judgment. So then, it is best to understand that the Rapture occurs at a time different from the coming of Christ in judgment. Thus, the Rapture has been described as pretribulational (before the wrath of God unfolded in the judgments of Rev 6–19 ). This event includes complete transformation (cf. 1Co 15:51–52 ; Php 3:20–21 ) and union with the Lord Jesus Christ that never ends."

Apparently, the Thessalonians knew all that God intended believers to know about coming judgment, and Paul had taught them what they hadn’t known about the Rapture ( 4:13–18 ), so Paul exhorted them to live godly lives in light of coming judgment on the world, rather than to be distracted by probing into issues of prophetic timing.

The OT prophets used “Day of the Lord” to describe near historical judgments (see Is 13:6–22 ; Eze 30:2–19 ; Joel 1:15 ; Am 5:18–20 ; Zep 1:14–18 ) or far eschatological divine judgments (see Joel 2:30–32 ; 3:14 ; Zec 14:1 ; Mal 4:1 , 5 ). It is also referred to as the “day of doom” and the “day of vengeance.” The NT calls it a day of “wrath,” day of “visitation,” and the “great day of God Almighty” ( Rev 16:14 ). These are terrifying judgments from God (cf. Joel 2:30–31 ; 2Th 1:7–10 ) for the overwhelming sinfulness of the world. The future “Day of the Lord,” which unleashes God’s wrath, falls into two parts: 1) the end of the 7-year tribulation period (cf. Rev 19:11–21 ), and 2) the end of the Millennium. These two are actually 1,000 years apart, and Peter refers to the end of the 1,000-year period in connection with the final “Day of the Lord” (cf. 2Pe 3:10 ; Rev 20:7–15 ). Here, Paul refers to that aspect of the “Day of the Lord,” which concludes the tribulation period. a thief in the night. This phrase is never used to refer to the rapture of the church. It is used of Christ’s coming in judgment on the day of the Lord at the end of the 7-year tribulation which is distinct from the rapture of the church ( see note on 4:15 ) and it is used of the judgment that concludes the Millennium ( 2Pe 3:10 ).

The contrast between believers and the lost is emphatic, and Paul draws it out all the way through v. 7 . Believers will not experience the wrath of God because they are different in nature.
