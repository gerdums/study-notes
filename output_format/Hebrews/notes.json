The very statement implies that the things described in 5:11—6:5 do not accompany salvation but are indicative of unbelief and apostasy. though we are speaking in this way.

Superior to the cleansing capability of the ashes of an animal is the cleansing power of the sacrifice of Christ. the blood of Christ. This is an expression that refers not simply to the fluid, but the whole atoning sacrificial work of Christ in His death. Blood is used as a substitute word for death (cf.

Some interpreters argue that the lack of the definite article in the Greek makes this a reference to Christ’s own “eternal spirit” (in the sense of an endless life, cf. 7:16 ). However, the references to the Holy Spirit in 2:4 and 6:4 are also without the definite article. The use of “eternal” as a qualifier serves to relate the Spirit to the “eternal redemption” (v. 12 ) and the “eternal inheritance” (v. 15 ) which Christ accomplished by His sacrificial death. offered Himself. See notes on v. 7 ; Jn 10:17–18 . The animals in the Levitical system were brought involuntarily and without understanding to their deaths. Christ came of His own volition with a full understanding of the necessity and consequences of His sacrifice. His sacrifice was not just His blood; it was His entire human nature (cf. 10:10 ). without blemish. In the LXX, the term is used for describing acceptable sacrifices including the red heifer ( Nu 19:3 ; cf. Ex 29:1 ; Lv 1:3 ). A similar reference is found in 1Pe 1:19 . conscience.

The same invitation is found in the first NT book to be written ( Jas 4:8 ), where James reveals the corollary of drawing near to God: God will draw near to you. Asaph taught that it is a good thing to draw near to God ( Ps 73:28 ). The full restoration of Israel to God’s blessing is dependent upon them drawing near to Him ( Jer 30:18–22 ).

Jer 24:7 ; Mt 15:8 ). This one thing these particular Hebrews lacked: genuine commitment to Christ. full assurance of faith. See note on 6:11 .

The imagery in this verse is taken from the sacrificial ceremonies of the Old Covenant, where blood was sprinkled as a sign of cleansing, and the priests were continually washing themselves and the sacred vessels in basins of clear water. Being “washed with pure water” does not refer to Christian baptism, but to the Holy Spirit’s purifying a person’s life by means of the Word of God (cf. Eph 5:25–26 ; Tit 3:5 ).
