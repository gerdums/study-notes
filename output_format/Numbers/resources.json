    "content": "Numbers Title The English title “Numbers” comes from the Greek (LXX) and Latin (Vg.) versions. This designation is based on the numberings that are a major focus of chaps. <a ref='Nu 1-4'>1–4</a> and <a ref='Nu 26'>26</a> . The most common Hebrew title comes from the fifth word in the Hebrew text of <a ref='Numbers 1:1'>1:1</a> , “in the wilderness [of].” This name is much more descriptive of the total contents of the book, which recount the history of Israel during almost 39 years of wandering in the wilderness. Another Hebrew title, favored by some early church Fathers, is based on the first word of the Hebrew text of <a ref='Numbers 1:1'>1:1</a> , “and He spoke.” This designation emphasizes that the book records the Word of God to Israel. Author and Date The first 5 books of the Bible, called the Law, of which Numbers is the fourth, are ascribed to Moses throughout Scripture ( <a ref='Joshua 8:31'>Jos 8:31</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 14:6'>2Ki 14:6</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 8:1'>Ne 8:1</a> ; <a ref='Mark 12:26'>Mk 12:26</a> ; <a ref='John 7:19'>Jn 7:19</a> ). The book of Numbers itself refers to the writing of Moses in <a ref='Numbers 33:2'>33:2</a> and <a ref='Numbers 36:13'>36:13</a> . Numbers was written in the final year of Moses’ life. The events from <a ref='Numbers 20:1'>20:1</a> to the end occur in the 40th year after the Exodus. The account ends with Israel poised on the eastern side of the Jordan River across from Jericho ( <a ref='Numbers 36:13'>36:13</a> ), which is where the conquest of the land of Canaan began ( <a ref='Jos 3-6'>Jos 3–6</a> ). The book of Numbers must be dated ca. 1405 BC, since it is foundational to the book of Deuteronomy, and Deuteronomy is dated in the 11th month of the 40th year after the Exodus ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:3'>Dt 1:3</a> ). Background and Setting Most of the events of the book are set “in the wilderness.” The word “wilderness” is used 48 times in Numbers. This term refers to land that contains little vegetation or trees, and because of a sparsity of rainfall, it cannot be cultivated. This land is best used for tending flocks of animals. In <a ref='Numbers 1:1–10:10'>1:1—10:10</a> , Israel encamped in “the wilderness of Sinai.” It was at Sinai that the Lord had entered into the Mosaic Covenant with them ( <a ref='Ex 19-24'>Ex 19–24</a> ). From <a ref='Numbers 10:11–12:16'>10:11—12:16</a> , Israel traveled from Sinai to Kadesh. In <a ref='Numbers 13:1–20:13'>13:1—20:13</a> , the events took place in and around Kadesh, which was located in “the wilderness of Paran” ( <a ref='Numbers 12:16'>12:16</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 13:3'>13:3</a> , <a ref='Numbers 13:26'>26</a> ), “the wilderness of Zin” ( <a ref='Numbers 13:21'>13:21</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 20:1'>20:1</a> ). From <a ref='Numbers 20:14–22:1'>20:14—22:1</a> , Israel traveled from Kadesh to the “plains of Moab.” All the events of <a ref='Numbers 22:2–36:13'>22:2—36:13</a> occurred while Israel was encamped in the plain to the north of Moab. That plain was a flat and fertile piece of land in the middle of the wasteland ( <a ref='Numbers 21:20'>21:20</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 23:28'>23:28</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 24:1'>24:1</a> ). The book of Numbers concentrates on events that take place in the second and fortieth years after the Exodus. All incidents recorded in <a ref='Numbers 1:1–14:45'>1:1—14:45</a> occur in 1444 BC, the year after the Exodus. Everything referred to after <a ref='Numbers 20:1'>20:1</a> is dated ca. 1406/1405 BC, the 40th year after the Exodus. The laws and events found in <a ref='Numbers 15:1–19:22'>15:1—19:22</a> are undated, but probably all should be dated ca. 1443 to 1407 BC. The lack of material devoted to this 37 year period, in comparison with the other years of the journey from Egypt to Canaan, communicates how wasted these years were because of Israel’s rebellion against the Lord and His consequent judgment. Historical and Theological Themes Numbers chronicles the experiences of two generations of the nation of Israel. The first generation participated in the Exodus from Egypt. Their story begins in <a ref='Exodus 2:23'>Ex 2:23</a> and continues through Leviticus and into the first 14 chapters of Numbers. This generation was numbered for the war of conquest in Canaan ( <a ref='Numbers 1:1–46'>1:1–46</a> ). However, when the people arrived at the southern edge of Canaan, they refused to enter the land ( <a ref='Numbers 14:1–10'>14:1–10</a> ). Because of their rebellion against the Lord, all the adults 20 and over (except Caleb and Joshua) were sentenced to die in the wilderness ( <a ref='Numbers 14:26–38'>14:26–38</a> ). In chaps. <a ref='Nu 15-25'>15–25</a> , the first and second generations overlap; the first died out as the second grew to adulthood. A second numbering of the people commenced the history of this second generation ( <a ref='Numbers 26:1–56'>26:1–56</a> ). These Israelites did go to war ( <a ref='Numbers 26:2'>26:2</a> ) and inherited the land ( <a ref='Numbers 26:52–56'>26:52–56</a> ). The story of this second generation, beginning in <a ref='Numbers 26:1'>Numbers 26:1</a> , continues through the books of Deuteronomy and Joshua. Three theological themes permeate Numbers. First, the Lord Himself communicated to Israel through Moses ( <a ref='Numbers 1:1'>1:1</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 7:89'>7:89</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 12:6–8'>12:6–8</a> ), so the words of Moses had divine authority. Israel’s response to Moses mirrored her obedience or disobedience to the Lord. Numbers contains three distinct divisions based on Israel’s response to the word of the Lord: obedience (chaps. <a ref='Nu 1-10'>1–10</a> ), disobedience (chaps. <a ref='Nu 11-25'>11–25</a> ), and renewed obedience (chaps. <a ref='Nu 26-36'>26–36</a> ). The second theme is that the Lord is the God of judgment. Throughout Numbers, the “anger” of the Lord was aroused in response to Israel’s sin ( <a ref='Numbers 11:1'>11:1</a> , <a ref='Numbers 11:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Numbers 11:33'>33</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 12:9'>12:9</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 14:18'>14:18</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 25:3–4'>25:3–4</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 32:10'>32:10</a> , <a ref='Numbers 32:13–14'>13–14</a> ). Third, the faithfulness of the Lord to keep His promise to give the seed of Abraham the land of Canaan is emphasized ( <a ref='Numbers 15:2'>15:2</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 26:52–56'>26:52–56</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 27:12'>27:12</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 33:50–56'>33:50–56</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 34:1–29'>34:1–29</a> ). Interpretive Challenges Four major interpretive challenges face the reader of Numbers. First, is the book of Numbers a separate book, or is it a part of a larger literary whole, the Pentateuch? The biblical books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy form the Torah. The remainder of the Scripture always views these 5 books as a unit. The ultimate meaning of Numbers cannot be divorced from its context in the Pentateuch. The first verse of the book speaks of the Lord, Moses, the tabernacle, and the Exodus from Egypt. This assumes that the reader is familiar with the 3 books that precede Numbers. Still, every Hebrew manuscript available divides the Pentateuch in exactly the same way as the present text. In them the book of Numbers is a well defined unit, with a structural integrity of its own. The book has its own beginning, middle, and ending, even as it functions within a larger whole. Thus, the book of Numbers is also to be viewed with singular identity. The second interpretive question asks, “Is there a sense of coherence in the book of Numbers?” It is readily evident that Numbers contains a wide variety of literary materials and forms. Census lists, genealogies, laws, historical narratives, poetry, prophecy, and travel lists are found in this book. Nevertheless, they are all blended to tell the story of Israel’s journey from Mt. Sinai to the plains of Moab. The coherence of Numbers is reflected in the outline that follows. A third issue deals with the large numbers given for the tribes of Israel in <a ref='Numbers 1:46'>1:46</a> and <a ref='Numbers 26:51'>26:51</a> . These two lists of Israel’s men of war, taken 39 years apart, both put the number over 600,000. These numbers demand a total population for Israel in the wilderness of around 2.5 million at any one time. From a natural perspective, this total seems too high for the wilderness conditions to sustain. However, it must be recognized that the Lord supernaturally took care of Israel for 40 years ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 8:1–5'>Dt 8:1–5</a> ). Therefore, the large numbers must be accepted at face value ( <i>see note on <a ref='Numbers 1:46'>1:46</a></i> ). The fourth interpretive challenge concerns the heathen prophet Balaam, whose story is recorded in <a ref='Numbers 22:2–24:25'>22:2—24:25</a> . Even though Balaam claimed to know the Lord ( <a ref='Numbers 22:18'>22:18</a> ), Scripture consistently refers to him as a false prophet ( <a ref='2 Peter 2:15–16'>2Pe 2:15–16</a> , <a ref='Jude 1:11'>Jd 11</a> ). The Lord used Balaam as His mouthpiece to speak the true words He put in his mouth ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Numbers 22:2–24:25'>22:2—24:25</a></i> ). Outline I.

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Numbers 1:1–10:36'>1:1—10:36</a> The first 10 chapters of Numbers record the final preparations of Israel necessary for their conquest of the land of Canaan. In this section, Yahweh spoke to Israel through Moses ( <a ref='Numbers 1:1'>1:1</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 2:1'>2:1</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 3:1'>3:1</a> , <a ref='Numbers 3:5'>5</a> , <a ref='Numbers 3:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Numbers 3:14'>14</a> , <a ref='Numbers 3:44'>44</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 4:1'>4:1</a> , <a ref='Numbers 4:17'>17</a> , <a ref='Numbers 4:21'>21</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 5:1'>5:1</a> , <a ref='Numbers 5:5'>5</a> , <a ref='Numbers 5:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 6:1'>6:1</a> , <a ref='Numbers 6:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 7:4'>7:4</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 8:1'>8:1</a> , <a ref='Numbers 8:5'>5</a> , <a ref='Numbers 8:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 9:1'>9:1</a> , <a ref='Numbers 9:9'>9</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 10:1'>10:1</a> ), and Moses and Israel responded with obedience ( <a ref='Numbers 1:19'>1:19</a> , <a ref='Numbers 1:54'>54</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 2:33–34'>2:33–34</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 3:16'>3:16</a> , <a ref='Numbers 3:42'>42</a> , <a ref='Numbers 3:51'>51</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 4:49'>4:49</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 7:2–3'>7:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 8:3'>8:3</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 9:5'>9:5</a> , <a ref='Numbers 9:18'>18</a> , <a ref='Numbers 9:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 10:13'>10:13</a> , <a ref='Numbers 10:14–28'>14–28</a> [in accordance with <a ref='Numbers 2:34'>2:34</a> ]). These chapters divide into two parts ( <a ref='Numbers 1:1–6:27'>1:1—6:27</a> and <a ref='Numbers 7:1–10:36'>7:1—10:36</a> ), which both end with an invocation of Yahweh’s blessing on Israel ( <a ref='Numbers 6:22–27'>6:22–27</a> and <a ref='Numbers 10:35–36'>10:35–36</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 1:1–6:27'>1:1—6:27</a> These 6 chapters chronologically follow the events recorded in <a ref='Numbers 7:1–10:10'>7:1—10:10</a> . The ordering of Israel around the tabernacle ( <a ref='Numbers 1:1–4:49'>1:1—4:49</a> ) and the purity of the camp of Israel ( <a ref='Numbers 5:1–6:27'>5:1—6:27</a> ) were the final results of Yahweh’s commands that began in <a ref='Exodus 25:1'>Ex 25:1</a> . Obeying God’s instructions transformed an impure ( <a ref='Exodus 32:7–8'>Ex 32:7–8</a> ) and disorderly ( <a ref='Exodus 32:25'>Ex 32:25</a> ) Israel into a people ready to march into Canaan. <a ref='Numbers 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>Then Yahweh spoke to Moses.</b> This connects the revelation given here by Yahweh with <a ref='Exodus 25:1'>Ex 25:1ff.</a> and <a ref='Leviticus 1:1'>Lv 1:1ff.</a> The word from God directed everything that was done by Israel. <b>the wilderness of Sinai.</b> Israel had been encamped there for 11 months. See <a ref='Exodus 19:1'>Ex 19:1</a> . <b>the tent of meeting.</b> The tabernacle, where Yahweh’s glory resided in the cloud, had been erected one month earlier ( <a ref='Exodus 40:17'>Ex 40:17</a> ). This was God’s dwelling place in the midst of His people. In <a ref='Numbers 1:1–6:27'>Nu 1:1—6:27</a> , Israel was organized with the tabernacle as the central feature. <b>the second year.</b> Numbers begins in the 14th month (377 days) after the Exodus from Egypt. <a ref='Numbers 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>a census.</b> In <a ref='Exodus 30:11–16'>Ex 30:11–16</a> , Yahweh had commanded that a census of the males in Israel over 20 (excluding the Levites) be taken for the purpose of determining the ransom money for the service of the tabernacle. The result of that census is recorded in <a ref='Exodus 38:25–28'>Ex 38:25–28</a> . The total number, 603,550 ( <a ref='Exodus 38:26'>Ex 38:26</a> ), equals the number in <a ref='Numbers 1:46'>1:46</a> . <a ref='Numbers 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>go out to war.</b> The purpose of this census was to form a roster of fighting men. The book of Numbers looks ahead to the invasion of the land promised to Abraham (cf. <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>a man.</b> One leader from each of the 12 tribes was to assist Moses and Aaron in the numbering of the men. These same leaders are mentioned in <a ref='Numbers 2:1–34'>Nu 2:1–34</a> and <a ref='Numbers 10:14–28'>10:14–28</a> as the heads of tribes and in <a ref='Numbers 7:1–88'>7:1–88</a> they bring gifts to the tabernacle. <a ref='Numbers 1:17–46'>1:17–46</a> The numbers from the tribes were: Reuben 46,500 (v. <a ref='Numbers 1:21'>21</a> ) Simeon 59,300 (v. <a ref='Numbers 1:23'>23</a> ) Gad 45,650 (v. <a ref='Numbers 1:25'>25</a> ) Judah 74,600 (v. <a ref='Numbers 1:27'>27</a> ) Issachar 54,400 (v. <a ref='Numbers 1:29'>29</a> ) Zebulun 57,400 (v. <a ref='Numbers 1:31'>31</a> ) Ephraim 40,500 (v. <a ref='Numbers 1:33'>33</a> ) Manasseh 32,200 (v. <a ref='Numbers 1:35'>35</a> ) Benjamin 35,400 (v. <a ref='Numbers 1:37'>37</a> ) Dan 62,700 (v. <a ref='Numbers 1:39'>39</a> ) Asher 41,500 (v. <a ref='Numbers 1:41'>41</a> ) Naphtali 53,400 (v. <a ref='Numbers 1:43'>43</a> ) Total 603,550 (v. <a ref='Numbers 1:46'>46</a> ) The tribal order follows the pattern of Jacob’s wives: first, the sons of Leah; second, the sons of Rachel; and third, the sons of the maids, except Gad (born of Leah’s maid), who replaced Levi in the third-born position (cf. <a ref='Genesis 29:31–30:24'>Ge 29:31—30:24</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 35:16–20'>35:16–20</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 1:46'>1:46</a> <b>603,550.</b> This number, six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty, combined with the 22,000 Levite males a month old and above ( <a ref='Numbers 3:39'>3:39</a> ), allows for a total population of over 2,000,000 Israelites. Since this number seems too high for the wilderness conditions and relatively few firstborn sons ( <a ref='Numbers 3:43'>3:43</a> ), some have reinterpreted the plain meaning of the text by 1) saying “thousand” means “clan” or “chief” here, or 2) stating the numbers are symbolic. However, if “thousand” is not the meaning in this chapter, <a ref='Numbers 1:46'>1:46</a> would read 598 “clans” or “chiefs” with only 5,500 individuals. Thus, the meaning “thousand” must be retained. Further, there is no textual indication that these numbers are symbolic. The only conclusion is that God took care of over 2,000,000 people in the wilderness during the period of 40 years (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 8:3–4'>Dt 8:3–4</a> ). Tampering with the number is tampering with God’s purpose for these numbers—to show His power in behalf of Israel. <a ref='Numbers 1:50'>1:50</a> <b>appoint the Levites.</b> The tribe of Levi, including Moses and Aaron, was not included in this census because it was exempt from military service. The Levites were to serve Yahweh by carrying and attending to the tabernacle (cf. <a ref='Numbers 3:5–13'>3:5–13</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 4:1–33'>4:1–33</a> , <a ref='Numbers 4:46–49'>46–49</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 1:51'>1:51</a> <b>the layman.</b> This word often refers to the “alien” or “stranger.” The non-Levite Israelite was like a “foreigner” to the transporting of the tabernacle and had to keep his distance lest he die. <a ref='Numbers 1:53'>1:53</a> <b>no wrath.</b> The purpose of setting the Levites apart and arranging them around the tabernacle was to keep the wrath of Yahweh from consuming Israel (cf. <a ref='Exodus 32:10'>Ex 32:10</a> , <a ref='Exodus 32:25–29'>25–29</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>standard … banners.</b> The banners were flags identifying the individual tribes (probably with some sort of insignia). The standards were flags marking each of the 4 encampments of 3 tribes each. <b>tent of meeting.</b> For details see <a ref='Ex 25-30'>Ex 25–30</a> . <a ref='Numbers 2:3'>2:3</a> <b>on the east side … Judah.</b> Judah occupied the place of honor to the east. <a ref='Genesis 49:8–12'>Genesis 49:8–12</a> highlights the role and centrality Judah would have in the defeat of Israel’s enemies. Judah was the tribe through which the Messiah would be born. <b>Nahshon.</b> Nahshon appears in the later genealogies of the messianic line (cf. <a ref='Ruth 4:20'>Ru 4:20</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 1:4'>Mt 1:4</a> ).

The letters R and D are similar in Hebrew and were easily confused by the scribes who copied the text. <a ref='Numbers 2:17'>2:17</a> <b>set out.</b> As the tribes marched, the tabernacle was transported in the middle of the tribes of Israel, 6 in front and 6 behind. <a ref='Numbers 2:32'>2:32</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Numbers 1:46'>1:46</a> .</i> <a ref='Numbers 3:1'>3:1</a> <b>Aaron and Moses.</b> Because Aaron and his sons are emphasized in this chapter, Aaron is named first. <b>Mount Sinai.</b> Yahweh had first communicated to Moses His choice of Aaron and his sons as priests in <a ref='Exodus 28:1–29:46'>Ex 28:1—29:46</a> while he was in the midst of the cloud on Mt. Sinai ( <a ref='Exodus 24:18'>Ex 24:18</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 3:3'>3:3</a> <b>the anointed priests.</b> Of all the tribe of Levi, only the sons of Aaron were priests. Only priests could offer the sacrifices; the rest of the Levites aided them in the work of the tabernacle (cf. <a ref='Numbers 3:7–9'>3:7–9</a> ). <b>ordained.</b> The setting apart of Aaron and his sons to the priesthood is recorded in <a ref='Leviticus 8:1–9:24'>Lv 8:1—9:24</a> . <a ref='Numbers 3:4'>3:4</a> <b>Eleazar and Ithamar.</b> All of the future priests of Israel under the Mosaic Covenant were descendants of these two sons of Aaron. Eleazar and his descendants would later be singled out for great blessing (cf. <a ref='Numbers 25:10–13'>Nu 25:10–13</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 3:6'>3:6</a> <b>the tribe of Levi.</b> The specific task of the Levites was to serve Aaron, his sons, and all of Israel by doing the work of the tabernacle, further defined in <a ref='Numbers 3:25–26'>3:25–26</a> , <a ref='Numbers 3:31'>31</a> , <a ref='Numbers 3:36–37'>36–37</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 4:4–33'>4:4–33</a> . <a ref='Numbers 3:10'>3:10</a> <b>the outsider.</b> Outsiders or strangers (cf. <a ref='Numbers 1:51'>1:51</a> ) would die if they participated in priestly activities (cf. <a ref='Numbers 3:38'>3:38</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 16:40'>16:40</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 3:12'>3:12</a> <b>firstborn.</b> At the Exodus, Yahweh claimed for Himself the firstborn of Israel’s males (cf. <a ref='Exodus 13:1–2'>Ex 13:1–2</a> ). The firstborn was to act as the family priest. But when the full ministry of the Mosaic economy came in, God transferred the priestly duties to the Levites, perhaps partly because of their holy zeal in the golden calf incident (cf. <a ref='Exodus 32:29'>Ex 32:29</a> ).

All the Levites from 30–50 years old in service added up to 8,580 ( <a ref='Numbers 4:48'>4:48</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 5:1–4'>5:1–4</a> These verses deal with outward, visible defects. <a ref='Numbers 5:2'>5:2</a> <b>leper.</b> One having an infectious skin disease (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 13:1–14:57'>Lv 13:1—14:57</a> ). <b>discharge.</b> A bodily emission indicative of disease, primarily from the sex organs (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 15:1–33'>Lv 15:1–33</a> ). dead <b>person.</b> Physical contact with a dead body (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 21:11'>Lv 21:11</a> ). All of these prohibitions had sensible health benefits as well as serving to illustrate the need for moral cleanliness when approaching God. <a ref='Numbers 5:3'>5:3</a> <b>outside the camp … where I dwell in their midst.</b> God’s holy presence in the cloud in the tabernacle demanded cleanness. Therefore, all the unclean were barred from the encampment of Israel. <a ref='Numbers 5:5–10'>5:5–10</a> These verses deal with personal sins, which are not as outwardly visible as the uncleanness of <a ref='Numbers 5:1–4'>5:1–4</a> . <a ref='Numbers 5:6'>5:6</a> <b>against Yahweh.</b> A sin committed against God’s people was considered a sin committed against God Himself. There was a need for confession and restitution in addition to the trespass offering (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 5:14–6:7'>Lv 5:14—6:7</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 5:8'>5:8</a> <b>no</b> kinsman <b>redeemer.</b> A supplement to <a ref='Leviticus 6:1–7'>Lv 6:1–7</a> .

Adultery was to be determined and dealt with to maintain the purity of the camp. To accomplish that purity, God called for a very elaborate and public trial. If adultery was proven, it was punished with death, and this ceremony made guilt or innocence very apparent. It was not a trial with normal judicial process, since such sins are secret and lack witnesses, but it was effective. The ceremony was designed to be so terrifying and convicting that the very tendencies of human nature would make it clear if the person was guilty. <a ref='Numbers 5:14'>5:14</a> <b>a spirit of jealousy.</b> A mood of suspicion came over the husband that his wife had defiled herself with another man. The accuracy of the suspicion was determined to be right or wrong. <a ref='Numbers 5:15'>5:15</a> <b>a reminder of iniquity.</b> The purpose of the husband’s offering was to bring the secret iniquity (if it was present) to light. How this was done is explained in <a ref='Numbers 5:18'>5:18</a> , <a ref='Numbers 5:25–26'>25–26</a> . <a ref='Numbers 5:18'>5:18</a> <b>before Yahweh.</b> The woman was brought to a priest at the tabernacle.

This seems to signify the expectation of judgment and consequent mourning if the woman was proven to be guilty. <b>water of bitterness.</b> This water included dust from the tabernacle floor ( <a ref='Numbers 5:17'>5:17</a> ) and the ink used to write the curses ( <a ref='Numbers 5:23'>5:23</a> ). The woman was to drink the water ( <a ref='Numbers 5:26'>5:26</a> ). If the woman was guilty, the water would make her life bitter by carrying out the curse of making her thigh rot and her belly swell ( <a ref='Numbers 5:21'>5:21</a> , <a ref='Numbers 5:27'>27</a> ). The public, frightening nature of this test could not fail to make guilt or innocence appear when the conscience was so assaulted. <a ref='Numbers 5:28'>5:28</a> <b>conceive a seed.</b> The penalty for the guilty wife was obvious, since the death penalty was called for. In contrast, the innocent wife was assured she would live to bring forth children. <a ref='Numbers 6:1–21'>6:1–21</a> Whereas <a ref='Numbers 5:1–31'>5:1–31</a> dealt with the cleansing of the camp by dealing with the unclean and sinful, <a ref='Numbers 6:1–21'>6:1–21</a> showed how consecration to Yahweh was possible for every Israelite. Although only the family of Aaron could be priests, any man or woman could be “priestly” (i.e., dedicated to God’s service) for a time (from a month to a lifetime) by means of the vow of a Nazirite. Such a vow was made by people unusually devout toward God and dedicated to His service. <a ref='Numbers 6:2'>6:2</a> <b>the vow of a Nazirite.</b> The word “vow” here is related to the word “wonder,” which signifies something out of the ordinary. “Nazirite” transliterates a Hebrew term meaning “dedication by separation.” The Nazirite separated himself to Yahweh by separating himself from 1) grape products ( <a ref='Numbers 6:3–4'>6:3–4</a> ), 2) the cutting of one’s hair ( <a ref='Numbers 6:5'>6:5</a> ), and 3) contact with a dead body ( <a ref='Numbers 6:6–7'>6:6–7</a> ). The High Priest was also forbidden 1) to drink wine while serving in the tabernacle ( <a ref='Leviticus 10:9'>Lv 10:9</a> ), and 2) to touch dead bodies ( <a ref='Leviticus 21:11'>Lv 21:11</a> ). Further, both the High Priest’s crown ( <a ref='Exodus 29:6'>Ex 29:6</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 39:30'>39:30</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 8:9'>Lv 8:9</a> ) and the Nazirite’s head ( <a ref='Numbers 6:9'>6:9</a> , <a ref='Numbers 6:18'>18</a> ) are referred to by the same Hebrew word. The Nazirite’s hair was like the High Priest’s crown. Like the High Priest, the Nazirite was holy to Yahweh ( <a ref='Numbers 6:8'>6:8</a> ; cf: <a ref='Exodus 28:36'>Ex 28:36</a> ) all the days ( <a ref='Numbers 6:4–6'>6:4–6</a> , <a ref='Numbers 6:8'>8</a> ) of his vow. <a ref='Numbers 6:9'>6:9</a> <b>dies … suddenly.</b> If the Nazirite inadvertently came in contact with a dead body, he was to shave his head, on the eighth day bring the prescribed offerings, and begin the days of his vow again. This is a good illustration of the fact that sin can become mingled with the best intentions, and is not always premeditated. When sin is mixed with the holiest actions, it calls for a renewed cleansing. <a ref='Numbers 6:13'>6:13</a> <b>fulfilled.</b> At the end of the determined time, the Nazirite was released from his vow through offerings and the shaving of his head. His hair was to be brought to the sanctuary at the time of those offerings (cf. <a ref='Acts 18:18'>Ac 18:18</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 6:22–27'>6:22–27</a> Obedient Israel, organized before and consecrated to Yahweh, was the recipient of God’s blessing (i.e., His favor) pronounced by the priests. <a ref='Numbers 6:24'>6:24</a> <b>bless.</b> Yahweh’s blessing was described as His face (i.e., His presence) shining on His people (v. <a ref='Numbers 6:25'>25</a> ) and looking at them (v. <a ref='Numbers 6:26'>26</a> ). God shone forth in benevolence on Israel and looked on them for good. <b>keep.</b> The results of Yahweh’s blessing were His preservation of Israel (“keep”), His kindness toward her (“be gracious,” v. <a ref='Numbers 6:25'>25</a> ), and her total well-being (“peace,” v. <a ref='Numbers 6:26'>26</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 6:27'>6:27</a> <b>invoke My name.</b> The name of Yahweh represented His person and character. The priests were to call for God to dwell among His people and meet all their needs. <a ref='Numbers 7:1–10:36'>7:1—10:36</a> These 4 chapters show how Yahweh spoke to Moses ( <a ref='Numbers 7:89'>7:89</a> ) and led Israel ( <a ref='Numbers 9:22'>9:22</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 10:11–12'>10:11–12</a> ) from the tabernacle. As Israel was properly oriented toward Yahweh and obeyed His word, God gave them victory over their enemies ( <a ref='Numbers 10:35'>10:35</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 7:1–89'>7:1–89</a> As the people of Israel had been generous in giving to the construction of the tabernacle (see <a ref='Exodus 35:4–29'>Ex 35:4–29</a> ), they showed the same generosity in its dedication. <a ref='Numbers 7:1'>7:1</a> <b>finished setting up the tabernacle.</b> According to <a ref='Exodus 40:17'>Ex 40:17</a> , the tabernacle was raised up on the first day of the first month of the second year. Thus the tabernacle was set up 11 1/2 months after the Exodus from Egypt. <a ref='Numbers 7:2'>7:2</a> <b>the leaders of Israel.</b> The leaders of the 12 tribes were those named in <a ref='Numbers 1:5–15'>1:5–15</a> who oversaw the numbering of the people. The order of the presentation by tribe of their offerings to the tabernacle was the same as the order of march given in <a ref='Numbers 2:3–32'>2:3–32</a> . <a ref='Numbers 7:6'>7:6</a> <b>the carts and the oxen.</b> These were to be used in the transportation of the tabernacle. According to v. <a ref='Numbers 7:9'>9</a> , the sons of Kohath did not receive a cart because they were to carry the holy things of the tabernacle on their shoulders. <a ref='Numbers 7:12'>7:12</a> <b>the first day.</b> I.e., the first day of the first month. The gifts of the leaders to the tabernacle were given over 12 successive days. <a ref='Numbers 7:84–88'>7:84–88</a> Each of the leaders gave the same offerings to the tabernacle. Here the total of all the gifts was given. <a ref='Numbers 7:89'>7:89</a> <b>He spoke to him.</b> With the completion of the tabernacle, Yahweh communicated His Word to Moses from the mercy seat in the Holy of Holies (see <a ref='Leviticus 1:1'>Lv 1:1</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 1:1'>Nu 1:1</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 8:1–4'>8:1–4</a> <a ref='Exodus 25:32–40'>Exodus 25:32–40</a> recorded the instructions for the making of the golden lampstand and <a ref='Exodus 37:17–24'>Ex 37:17–24</a> reported its completion. Here, as a part of the dedication of the tabernacle, the 7 lamps of the lampstand were lit. <a ref='Numbers 8:5–26'>8:5–26</a> This ceremony set apart the Levites to the service of Yahweh. Their dedication was a feature of the overall description of the dedication of the tabernacle. <a ref='Numbers 8:6'>8:6</a> <b>cleanse.</b> In contrast to the priests who were consecrated ( <a ref='Exodus 29:1'>Ex 29:1</a> , <a ref='Exodus 29:9'>9</a> ), the Levites were cleansed. According to v. <a ref='Numbers 8:7'>7</a> , this cleansing was accomplished by first, the sprinkling of water; second, the shaving of the body; and third, the washing of the clothes. This cleansing of the Levites made them pure so they might come into contact with the holy objects of the tabernacle. Similar requirements were given for the cleansing of the leper in <a ref='Leviticus 14:8–9'>Lv 14:8–9</a> . <a ref='Numbers 8:9'>8:9</a> <b>the whole congregation.</b> Since the Levites took the place of the firstborn, who had acted as family priests among the people of Israel (see vv. <a ref='Numbers 8:16–18'>16–18</a> ), all of the congregation of Israel showed their identification with the Levites by the laying on of their hands. <a ref='Numbers 8:19'>8:19</a> <b>a gift to Aaron.</b> The Levites were given by God to assist the priests. <b>no plague.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Numbers 1:53'>1:53</a> .</i> <a ref='Numbers 8:24'>8:24</a> <b>twenty-five years old.</b> The Levites were to begin their service in helping the priests at age 25. However, in <a ref='Numbers 4:3'>4:3</a> the age of commencement is 30. A rabbinic suggestion was that the Levites were to serve a 5-year apprenticeship. A better solution can be discovered by noting the differing tasks in the two chapters. <a ref='Nu 4'>Numbers 4</a> dealt with the carrying of the tabernacle, while here they helped in the service in the tabernacle. A Levite began serving in the tabernacle at 25 and carrying the tabernacle at 30. In both cases, his service ended at age 50. David later lowered the age to 20 (see <a ref='1 Chronicles 23:24'>1Chr 23:24</a> , <a ref='1 Chronicles 23:27'>27</a> ; cf. <a ref='Ezra 3:8'>Ezr 3:8</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 9:1–14'>9:1–14</a> The call from Yahweh to keep the Passover led to an inquiry from those whose uncleanness kept them from obeying. This request led to an amplification of the requirement by Yahweh. This was the second Passover. <a ref='Numbers 9:1'>9:1</a> <b>the first month.</b> The events recorded in these verses precede the beginning of the census in chap. <a ref='Nu 1'>1</a> , but follow the dedication of the tabernacle in chap. <a ref='Nu 7'>7</a> . <a ref='Numbers 9:3'>9:3</a> <b>twilight.</b> The time between the end of one day and the beginning of the next.

The cloud, the visible symbol of Yahweh’s presence, was continually sitting above the tabernacle. The movement of the cloud was the signal to Israel that they were to travel on their journey. <a ref='Numbers 9:15'>9:15</a> <b>tabernacle was erected.</b> The presence of Yahweh arrived when the tabernacle was completed and raised up on the first day of the first month of the second year after they had come out of Egypt. <a ref='Numbers 9:16'>9:16</a> <b>cloud … fire.</b> The presence of Yahweh which was seen in the cloud by day became a fire that was seen at night (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 16:2'>Lv 16:2</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 9:23'>9:23</a> <b>command … command.</b> The text emphasizes that Israel obeyed Yahweh at this point in her experience. Throughout the wilderness wanderings, the Israelites could only journey as the cloud led them. When it did not move, they stayed encamped where they were. <a ref='Numbers 10:1–10'>10:1–10</a> Israel was also to be guided by the blowing of the two silver trumpets made by Moses. Both a call to gather and a call to march were communicated with the trumpets. <a ref='Numbers 10:2'>10:2</a> <b>trumpets.</b> According to a Jewish tradition, these instruments were between 12 and 20 in. long and had a narrow tube that was flared at the end. <b>hammered work.</b> The same description is given concerning the cherubim above the mercy seat.

If only one trumpet was blown, the leaders were to come. <a ref='Numbers 10:5'>10:5</a> <b>set out.</b> The second purpose of the trumpets was to give a signal indicating that the tribes were to begin their march. The exact difference between the blowing for the gathering at the tabernacle and for the march is not known.

In accordance with <a ref='Genesis 49:8–12'>Ge 49:8–12</a> , the tribe of Judah was given preeminence as the ruling tribe.

Later, he joined with Judah in the conquest of the land and did receive the blessing of dwelling in the land. <a ref='Numbers 10:33'>10:33</a> <b>journey … three days.</b> The Israelites traveled for 3 days from Sinai before they encamped for more than one night. <a ref='Numbers 10:35–36'>10:35–36</a> As Israel traveled and encamped, Moses prayed that Yahweh would give victory and that His presence would be among her. <a ref='Numbers 11:1–25:18'>11:1—25:18</a> In contrast to <a ref='Nu 1-10'>Nu 1–10</a> , a major change takes place at <a ref='Numbers 11:1'>11:1</a> .

Ultimately, Moses and Aaron rebelled against Yahweh as well ( <a ref='Numbers 20:10'>20:10</a> , <a ref='Numbers 20:24'>24</a> ). In response to Israel’s disobedience, Yahweh’s anger was aroused ( <a ref='Numbers 11:1'>11:1</a> , <a ref='Numbers 11:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Numbers 11:33'>33</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 12:9'>12:9</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 14:18'>14:18</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 25:3–4'>25:3–4</a> ) and He plagued His people ( <a ref='Numbers 14:37'>14:37</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 16:46–50'>16:46–50</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 25:8–9'>25:8–9</a> , <a ref='Numbers 25:18'>18</a> ) as He had Pharaoh and the Egyptians ( <a ref='Exodus 9:14'>Ex 9:14</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 12:13'>12:13</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 30:12'>30:12</a> ).

Although the term “Cushite” could have been used concerning Zipporah, Moses’ first wife, it seems more likely that Moses had remarried after the death of Zipporah. The marriage to the Ethiopian woman had been recent and furnished the pretext for the attack of Miriam and Aaron. Since Miriam is mentioned first, she probably was the instigator of the attack against Moses. <a ref='Numbers 12:2'>12:2</a> <b>spoken only through Moses.</b> Miriam and Aaron asserted that God had spoken to them in the same way that He had spoken to Moses. <a ref='Numbers 12:3'>12:3</a> <b>very humble.</b> This statement is often cited as evidence that Moses could not have written the book of Numbers, for he would not have boasted in his own humility. However, the Holy Spirit certainly could inspire Moses to make an accurate statement about himself, probably against his own natural inclination. In this context, Moses was asserting there was nothing that he had done to provoke this attack by Miriam and Aaron. <a ref='Numbers 12:5'>12:5</a> <b>Yahweh came down.</b> As in <a ref='Genesis 11:5'>Ge 11:5</a> , this clause states that Yahweh knows and deals with situations on earth.

Also Yahweh did not speak to Moses through visions and dreams, but plainly. It was not that Moses saw the full glory of God (cf. <a ref='John 1:18'>Jn 1:18</a> ), but rather that he had the most explicit, intimate encounters (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:10'>Dt 34:10</a> ). <b>the form of Yahweh.</b> This is the likeness or representation of Yahweh which Moses was privileged to see.

The city had been fortified at about 1730 BC, 7 years before the building of Zoan in Egypt, and later became the inheritance of Caleb ( <a ref='Joshua 14:13–15'>Jos 14:13–15</a> ) and then David’s capital when he reigned over Judah ( <a ref='2 Samuel 2:1–4'>2Sa 2:1–4</a> ). <b>the descendants of Anak.</b> Cf. <a ref='Numbers 13:28'>13:28</a> .

Since Yahweh was not with them, they were defeated. <a ref='Numbers 15:1–41'>15:1–41</a> Even though the Israelites had rebelled against Yahweh and were under His judgment, Yahweh still planned to give the land of Canaan to them. These laws assumed Israel’s entrance into the land ( <a ref='Numbers 15:2'>15:2</a> , <a ref='Numbers 15:17'>17</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 15:1–16'>15:1–16</a> The law of the grain offering recorded here differs from that given in <a ref='Le 2'>Lv 2</a> .

In vv. <a ref='Numbers 15:27–29'>27–29</a> , the offerings for the individual person who sinned unintentionally were stated. <a ref='Numbers 15:30'>15:30</a> <b>does</b> anything <b>with a high hand.</b> These sins, committed knowingly and deliberately were described as blasphemous because they were an arrogant act of insubordination against Yahweh.

Their argument against Moses and Aaron was that by claiming the unique right and responsibility to represent the people before God, they exalted themselves based on the promise that “all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and Yahweh is in their midst” ( <a ref='Numbers 16:3'>16:3</a> ). Yahweh dealt with these rebels ( <a ref='Numbers 16:4–40'>16:4–40</a> ) and reaffirmed His choice of Aaron ( <a ref='Numbers 16:41–17:13'>16:41—17:13</a> ). Finally, Yahweh restated the duties and support of both the priests and Levites ( <a ref='Numbers 18:1–32'>18:1–32</a> ). These events took place at some unidentified place and time during Israel’s wilderness wanderings. <a ref='Numbers 16:1'>16:1</a> <b>Korah.</b> Korah was descended from Levi through Kohath. Being a son of Kohath, he already had significant duties at the tabernacle (see <a ref='Numbers 4:1–20'>4:1–20</a> ).

The censers were holy to Yahweh since they had been used in the tabernacle. Therefore, Eleazar was commanded to hammer out the metal censers into a covering for the altar. That covering was to be a perpetual reminder that God had chosen Aaron and his descendants for the priesthood. <a ref='Numbers 16:41–50'>16:41–50</a> Instead of bringing about the repentance of the people, Yahweh’s wrath only led to more complaining. Though the children of Israel held Moses and Aaron accountable for the people who had been killed by Yahweh, it was the intervention of Moses and Aaron for the entire nation that saved them from destruction because of their opposition to God. <a ref='Numbers 16:46'>16:46</a> <b>incense.</b> Incense was symbolic of prayer.

Most of the older generation had died in the wilderness. <b>Kadesh.</b> As the people had begun their wilderness wanderings at Kadesh ( <a ref='Numbers 13:26'>13:26</a> ), so they ended them there. Kadesh was located on the northern boundary of the wilderness of Paran ( <a ref='Numbers 13:26'>13:26</a> ) and on the southeast border of the wilderness of Zin. <b>Miriam died.</b> Miriam, who led Israel in celebrating the victory over Egypt at the Red Sea ( <a ref='Exodus 15:20–21'>Ex 15:20–21</a> ), also led the attack against Moses recorded in <a ref='Numbers 12:1–15'>Nu 12:1–15</a> . Her death served as a symbol that the old generation would not enter Canaan. <a ref='Numbers 20:2'>20:2</a> <b>no water.</b> During Israel’s 40 years in the wilderness, water was their greatest physical need. Yahweh had provided it continually, beginning at Horeb ( <a ref='Exodus 17:1–7'>Ex 17:1–7</a> ). The present lack of water stirred the people to contend with Moses. <a ref='Numbers 20:3'>20:3</a> <b>If only we had breathed our last when our brothers breathed their last.</b> The situation was so desperate in the people’s mind that they wished they had been among those who died in Korah’s rebellion ( <a ref='Numbers 16:41–50'>16:41–50</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 20:6'>20:6</a> <b>fell on their faces.</b> As he had done in the past, Moses sought Yahweh’s counsel (see <a ref='Numbers 14:5'>14:5</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 16:4'>16:4</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 20:8'>20:8</a> <b>speak to the rock.</b> Though God told Moses to take his rod with which He had performed many wonders in the past ( <a ref='Exodus 4:1–5'>Ex 4:1–5</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 7:19–21'>7:19–21</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 14:16'>14:16</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 17:5–6'>17:5–6</a> ), he was only to speak to the rock for it to yield water. <a ref='Numbers 20:10'>20:10</a> <b>you rebels.</b> Instead of speaking to the rock, Moses spoke to the people, accusing them of being rebels against God. By his actions, Moses joined the people in rebellion against God (see <a ref='Numbers 27:14'>27:14</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 20:12'>20:12</a> <b>you did not believe Me.</b> Yahweh’s evaluation of Moses was that he failed to take God at His word and thus to treat Him as holy to the people. Moses here failed in the same way as Israel had at Kadesh 38 years previously ( <a ref='Numbers 14:11'>14:11</a> ). <b>you shall not bring this assembly into the land.</b> God’s judgment upon Moses for his sin of striking the rock was that he would not take Israel into the land of Canaan. The inclusion of Aaron demonstrated his partnership with Moses in the action against Yahweh. <a ref='Numbers 20:13'>20:13</a> <b>Meribah.</b> Lit. “contention, quarreling.” The same name was used earlier at the first occasion of bringing water from the rock ( <a ref='Exodus 17:7'>Ex 17:7</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 20:14–21'>20:14–21</a> Moses’ attempt to pass through the territory of Edom was rejected by the king. <a ref='Numbers 20:14'>20:14</a> <b>your brother Israel.</b> The people of Edom were descended from Esau, the brother of Jacob (see <a ref='Genesis 36:1'>Ge 36:1</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 20:17'>20:17</a> <b>the king’s highway.</b> The major north-south trade route from the Gulf of Aqabah north to Damascus, which passed through the Edomite city of Sela. <a ref='Numbers 20:20'>20:20</a> <b>with a heavy force and with a strong hand.</b> The king of Edom sent out his army to intercept Israel. Since Israel was forbidden by Yahweh to engage in warfare with Edom ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:4–6'>Dt 2:4–6</a> ), they turned away from Edom’s border. <a ref='Numbers 20:22–29'>20:22–29</a> Eleazar succeeded his father, Aaron, as High Priest. Aaron’s death further marked the passing of the first generation. <a ref='Numbers 20:22'>20:22</a> <b>Mount Hor.</b> Likely a mountain to the northeast of Kadesh on the border of Edom. <a ref='Numbers 20:24'>20:24</a> <b>because you rebelled against My command.</b> Aaron had joined Moses in rebellion against God (v. <a ref='Numbers 20:12'>12</a> ). Aaron’s death foreshadowed the death of Moses. <a ref='Numbers 20:29'>20:29</a> <b>wept … thirty days.</b> This was the same mourning period as for Moses ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:8'>Dt 34:8</a> ). Since the normal time for mourning was 7 days (see <a ref='Genesis 50:10'>Ge 50:10</a> ), the length of this mourning showed the importance of Aaron and the loss to Israel. <a ref='Numbers 21:1–3'>21:1–3</a> Israel’s first victory over the Canaanites occurred at Hormah, the place they had previously been defeated (see <a ref='Numbers 14:45'>14:45</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 21:1'>21:1</a> <b>king of Arad.</b> This raiding king came from a Canaanite city in the south (i.e., the Negev). <a ref='Numbers 21:3'>21:3</a> <b>they devoted them … to destruction.</b> Israel vowed to Yahweh that if He would give them victory over Arad, they would completely destroy them, not claiming the spoils of victory for themselves. Yahweh responded to this vow and gave victory. <a ref='Numbers 21:4–9'>21:4–9</a> After their victory over Arad, Israel showed again their lack of obedience toward Yahweh. <a ref='Numbers 21:4'>21:4</a> <b>by the way to the Red Sea.</b> Cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:1'>Dt 2:1</a> . Since the way through Edom was barred, Moses turned to the south to take Israel around Edom. Thus, Israel journeyed toward Elath on the coast of the Gulf of Aqabah. This long, circuitous route led to impatience and frustration on the part of Israel. <a ref='Numbers 21:5'>21:5</a> <b>this miserable food.</b> The people’s impatience led them to despise the manna (see <a ref='Numbers 11:6'>11:6</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 21:6'>21:6</a> <b>fiery serpents.</b> So called because these snake bites inflicted a fiery inflammation. <a ref='Numbers 21:7'>21:7</a> <b>We have sinned.</b> The people confessed their iniquity and asked that they might be released from the judgment God had sent. <a ref='Numbers 21:9'>21:9</a> <b>a bronze serpent.</b> One had to fix his gaze upon this snake, a definite act of the will, if he wanted to be healed and live. See the typological use of this incident in <a ref='John 3:14–15'>Jn 3:14–15</a> . <a ref='Numbers 21:10–20'>21:10–20</a> Israel circled around both Edom and Moab and encamped on the north side of the Arnon River in the territory of the Amorites. <a ref='Numbers 21:14'>21:14</a> <b>the Book of the Wars of Yahweh.</b> This was apparently a book of victory songs that was current at the time of Moses, possibly written by Moses or a contemporary. The work is cited here as evidence that the Arnon River was the northern boundary of Moab. <a ref='Numbers 21:16'>21:16</a> <b>Beer.</b> Lit. “well.” Here God provided water for Israel. In response, Israel praised Yahweh with a song which might have also come from “the Book of the Wars of Yahweh” (vv. <a ref='Numbers 21:17–18'>17–18</a> ). Hymns and Songs of the Old Testament The earliest recorded song in the Bible is referred to as the Song of Moses (see <a ref='Ex 15'>Ex 15</a> ). This hymn was sung by the people to celebrate God’s miraculous deliverance of the Hebrews from the Egyptian army at the Red Sea ( <a ref='Exodus 14:3–30'>Ex 14:3–30</a> ). Other significant hymns and songs of the Old Testament include the following: Personality Description Biblical Reference Israelites Sung by the people as they dug life-saving wells in the wilderness <a ref='Numbers 21:14–18'>Nu 21:14–18</a> Moses A song of praise to God by Moses just before his death <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:1–44'>Dt 32:1–44</a> Deborah and Barak A victory song after Israel’s defeat of the Canaanites <a ref='Judges 5:1–31'>Jdg 5:1–31</a> Israelite Women A song to celebrate David’s defeat of Goliath <a ref='1 Samuel 18:6–7'>1Sa 18:6–7</a> Levite Singers A song of praise at the dedication of the temple in Jerusalem <a ref='2 Chronicles 5:12–14'>2Chr 5:12–14</a> Levite Singers A song of praise, presented as a marching song as the army of Israel prepared for battle <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:20–23'>2Chr 20:20–23</a> Levite Singers A song at the temple restoration ceremony during Hezekiah’s reign <a ref='2 Chronicles 29:25–30'>2Chr 29:25–30</a> Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Numbers 21:21–32'>21:21–32</a> As with Edom ( <a ref='Numbers 20:14–19'>20:14–19</a> ), Israel requested passage through the land of Sihon, a king of the Amorites. Since there was no requirement from Yahweh not to engage the Amorites in warfare as there had been for Edom, when Sihon brought out his army, he was attacked and defeated by Israel. Israel thus took the land bounded by the Arnon River on the south, the Dead Sea and Jordan River on the west, the Jabbok River on the north, and the land of the Ammonites on the east. <a ref='Numbers 21:27'>21:27</a> <b>those who use proverbs say.</b> These words came from the wise men, probably among the Amorites. The words of vv. <a ref='Numbers 21:27–30'>27–30</a> describe the Amorites’ defeat of the Moabites north of the Arnon River. Ironically, as the Amorites had taken the land from the Moabites, the Israelites had taken the land from the Amorites. The purpose of these words cited by Moses was to substantiate Israel’s right to this land. According to God’s commandments, the territory belonging to the Moabites was not to be taken by Israel because the Moabites were descendants of Lot ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:9'>Dt 2:9</a> ). However, what belonged to the Amorites had been promised to Israel and was theirs for the taking. <a ref='Numbers 21:33–35'>21:33–35</a> The land north of the Jabbok River was under the control of Og, another Amorite king. Og attacked Israel and suffered a devastating defeat. Thus, all of the land in the Transjordan from the Arnon River in the south to the heights of Bashan in the north came under Israelite control. <a ref='Numbers 22:1'>22:1</a> With their control of Transjordan secured, Israel moved unimpeded to the plains of Moab in preparation for assaulting Canaan. <a ref='Numbers 22:2–24:25'>22:2—24:25</a> The narrative changes to center on Balaam, a pagan prophet. His oracles reassert the faithfulness of Yahweh to the Abrahamic Covenant and His purpose to bless Israel. In <a ref='Numbers 22:2–40'>22:2–40</a> , the events leading to Balaam’s words are recorded. This is followed in <a ref='Numbers 22:41–24:24'>22:41—24:24</a> with the words of his prophecies, and the conclusion is in <a ref='Numbers 24:25'>24:25</a> . <a ref='Numbers 22:3'>22:3</a> <b>Moab was in great fear.</b> The Moabites were descendants of Lot (see <a ref='Genesis 19:36–37'>Ge 19:36–37</a> ). Balak, their king, had seen how the Israelites destroyed the Amorites. Not knowing that Israel was forbidden by God to attack Moab, he was terrified that the same end awaited him and his people ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:9'>Dt 2:9</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 22:4'>22:4</a> <b>Midian.</b> The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah (see <a ref='Genesis 25:1–4'>Ge 25:1–4</a> ), who lived south of Moab’s border. When Moab communicated to the elders of Midian that they were in danger of being destroyed by Israel as well, they joined with Moab in an alliance to defeat Israel. <a ref='Numbers 22:5'>22:5</a> <b>Balaam.</b> Balaam was from Pethor, a city on the Euphrates River, perhaps near Mari, where the existence of a cult of prophets whose activities resembled those of Balaam have been found. Balaam practiced magic and divination ( <a ref='Numbers 24:1'>24:1</a> ) and eventually led Israel into apostasy ( <a ref='Numbers 31:16'>31:16</a> ). Later Scripture identifies Balaam as a false prophet ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:3–6'>Dt 23:3–6</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 13:22'>Jos 13:22</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 24:9–10'>24:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 13:1–3'>Ne 13:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Micah 6:5'>Mic 6:5</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 2:15–16'>2Pe 2:15–16</a> ; <a ref='Jude 1:11'>Jd 11</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 2:14'>Rev 2:14</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 22:6'>22:6</a> <b>curse this people.</b> Knowing that Israel was too strong to defeat militarily, Balak called for Balaam to come and curse Israel. A curse was a spoken word that was believed to bring misfortune upon the one it was spoken against. Balak acknowledged that Balaam had the reputation of pronouncing curses that actually worked. <a ref='Numbers 22:8'>22:8</a> <b>as Yahweh may speak to me.</b> Throughout these chapters Balaam himself used the name “Yahweh,” i.e., Israel’s God ( <a ref='Numbers 22:13'>22:13</a> , <a ref='Numbers 22:18–19'>18–19</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 23:3'>23:3</a> , <a ref='Numbers 23:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 24:13'>24:13</a> ). In <a ref='Numbers 22:18'>22:18</a> he even called Yahweh, “Yahweh my God.” In this verse it must be assumed that Balaam expected the God of Israel to speak to him. As a pagan prophet he would anticipate making contact with the gods of any people. <a ref='Numbers 22:9'>22:9</a> <b>God came to Balaam.</b> Israel’s God did communicate to Balaam. However, rather than using the term “Yahweh,” which indicates a covenant relationship, God consistently used the word “God” when He spoke to him ( <a ref='Numbers 22:9'>22:9</a> , <a ref='Numbers 22:12'>12</a> , <a ref='Numbers 22:20'>20</a> ). Though Balaam used the word “Yahweh,” the biblical text makes it clear that he did not have a relationship with Israel’s God. <a ref='Numbers 22:12'>22:12</a> <b>they are blessed.</b> Balaam could not curse Israel because Yahweh had determined to give them blessing only. <a ref='Numbers 22:20'>22:20</a> <b>only the word which I speak to you.</b> Because of his great desire for the material wealth that would come to him, Balaam desired to go to Balak. He implored Yahweh even after God had told him not to go. God acceded to Balaam’s request to let him go, but told him that he could speak only the true message from God. <a ref='Numbers 22:22'>22:22</a> <b>because he was going.</b> Even though God had given Balaam permission to go (v. <a ref='Numbers 22:20'>20</a> ), He knew that his motive was not right. Thus the anger of Yahweh burned against Balaam because God knew that he was not yet submissive to what He required. The result of God’s confrontation with Balaam was a reaffirmation of the word given in v. <a ref='Numbers 22:20'>20</a> , repeated in v. <a ref='Numbers 22:35'>35</a> , that he was to speak only the words that God wanted him to speak. That Balaam got the message is explicitly stated in v. <a ref='Numbers 22:38'>38</a> . <b>the angel of Yahweh.</b> The angel of Yahweh was a manifestation of the presence of Yahweh Himself. He was equated with deity (see <a ref='Genesis 16:7'>Ge 16:7</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 18:1–2'>18:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 3:1–6'>Ex 3:1–6</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Exodus 3:2'>Ex 3:2</a> .</i> <a ref='Numbers 22:28'>22:28</a> <b>Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey.</b> Balaam’s donkey was able to see the angel of Yahweh with His drawn sword (v. <a ref='Numbers 22:23'>23</a> , <a ref='Numbers 22:25'>25</a> , <a ref='Numbers 22:27'>27</a> ). Realizing the danger to herself, she sought to avoid the Angel. In doing this, she preserved Balaam as well. Miraculously, the donkey was able to communicate with Balaam. <a ref='Numbers 22:31'>22:31</a> <b>Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam.</b> Yahweh allowed Balaam to see things as they really were, especially those things that are not ordinarily visible to humans, and to be submissive to His will as he went to Balak. <a ref='Numbers 22:41–23:12'>22:41—23:12</a> Balaam’s first oracle emphatically stated that Israel could not be cursed ( <a ref='Numbers 23:8'>23:8</a> ). She was unlike all the other nations of the world ( <a ref='Numbers 23:9'>23:9</a> ). Balaam even wished to share in her blessing ( <a ref='Numbers 23:10'>23:10</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 23:5'>23:5</a> <b>Yahweh put a word in Balaam’s mouth.</b> Even though Balak and Balaam offered sacrifices on pagan altars, it was Yahweh who gave Balaam his oracle. <a ref='Numbers 23:7'>23:7</a> <b>he took up his discourse.</b> This statement introduces each of Balaam’s speeches (vv. <a ref='Numbers 23:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Numbers 23:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 24:3'>24:3</a> , <a ref='Numbers 24:20–21'>20–21</a> , <a ref='Numbers 24:23'>23</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 23:10'>23:10</a> <b>Who can number the dust of Jacob.</b> Here is Oriental hyperbole signifying a very populous nation as Jacob’s posterity was to be (cf. <a ref='Genesis 13:16'>Ge 13:16</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 28:14'>28:14</a> ). <b>fourth part of Israel.</b> The camp was divided into 4 parts, one on each side of the tabernacle. If one could not count the part, certainly no one could count the whole. <a ref='Numbers 23:13–26'>23:13–26</a> Balaam’s second oracle reaffirmed Yahweh’s determination to bless Israel. The iniquity in Israel was mercifully set aside by Yahweh ( <a ref='Numbers 23:21'>23:21</a> ) and therefore would not stop His plan. The God who supernaturally brought Israel out of Egypt ( <a ref='Numbers 23:22'>23:22</a> ) would give victory over all her enemies ( <a ref='Numbers 23:24'>23:24</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 23:19'>23:19</a> <b>God is not a man.</b> In contrast to the unreliability of man, so well seen in Balaam himself, God is reliable and immutable. He does not change; therefore, His words always come to pass. <a ref='Numbers 23:27–24:14'>23:27—24:14</a> Balaam’s third oracle focused on the ultimate King (the “Messiah”), who would bring the blessings of the Abrahamic Covenant both to Israel and the nations. <a ref='Numbers 23:28'>23:28</a> <b>Peor.</b> Also named Beth-peor ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 3:29'>Dt 3:29</a> ), it was the location of a temple to Baal ( <a ref='Numbers 25:3'>25:3</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 24:2'>24:2</a> <b>the Spirit of God came upon him.</b> This terminology was regularly used in the OT for those whom God uniquely prepared to do His work (see <a ref='Judges 3:10'>Jdg 3:10</a> ). Unlike the previous two oracles, Balaam does not involve himself in divination before giving this third oracle. He is empowered with the Holy Spirit to utter God’s message accurately. <a ref='Numbers 24:3'>24:3</a> <b>whose eye is uncovered.</b> His inner eye of understanding had been opened by God’s Spirit. <a ref='Numbers 24:7'>24:7</a> <b>Agag.</b> In <a ref='1 Samuel 15:32–33'>1Sa 15:32–33</a> , an Amalekite king bore this name. The Amalekites were the first people to attack Israel after they left Egypt (see <a ref='Exodus 17:8–15'>Ex 17:8–15</a> ). “Agag” may be a proper name or a title of Amalekite rulers, like “Pharaoh” in Egypt. <a ref='Numbers 24:8'>24:8</a> <b>God brings him out of Egypt.</b> Because of the verbal similarities between <a ref='Numbers 24:8'>24:8</a> and <a ref='Numbers 24:9'>9</a> , with <a ref='Numbers 23:22'>23:22</a> and <a ref='Numbers 23:24'>24</a> , the “him” in this verse is usually interpreted to be Israel. However, since the “him” is sing. and the closest reference in v. <a ref='Numbers 24:7'>7</a> is to the coming king, it is better to see vv. <a ref='Numbers 24:8'>8</a> and <a ref='Numbers 24:9'>9</a> as referring to Israel’s king. <a ref='Numbers 24:9'>Numbers 24:9</a> is a direct quote from <a ref='Genesis 49:9'>Ge 49:9</a> , which speaks of the ultimate King who will come from Judah—the Messiah. <a ref='Numbers 24:9'>24:9</a> <b>Blessed is everyone who blesses you.</b> These words refer to <a ref='Genesis 12:3'>Ge 12:3</a> . The ultimate fulfillment of the Abrahamic Covenant centers around the coming Messiah. It is the one who blesses Israel who will ultimately reap God’s blessing in the future. <a ref='Numbers 24:14'>24:14</a> <b>in the last days.</b> Lit. “at the end of days.” This term is rightfully used in the OT for the distant future. Balaam’s fourth oracle takes the truth communicated in the third and applies it to Moab. <a ref='Numbers 24:15–19'>24:15–19</a> Balaam’s fourth oracle predicted the future coming of Israel’s king, who would “crush through the forehead of Moab” and conquer Edom. He will have total dominion. <a ref='Numbers 24:20–24'>24:20–24</a> Balaam’s final 3 oracles look at the future of the nations. First, Amalek will come to an end ( <a ref='Numbers 24:20'>24:20</a> ). Second, the Kenites, identical to or a part of the Midianites, will be carried away by Asshur, i.e., Assyria ( <a ref='Numbers 24:21–22'>24:21–22</a> ). Third, Assyria and Eber, probably Israel herself ( <a ref='Genesis 10:21'>Ge 10:21</a> ), will be afflicted by Cyprus or Kittim (Kittim came to represent the Mediterranean region west of Canaan and in <a ref='Daniel 11:30'>Da 11:30</a> refers to Rome), until Cyprus comes to ruin. <a ref='Numbers 25:1–18'>25:1–18</a> The final failure of Israel before the conquest of Canaan occurred in the plains of Moab. According to <a ref='Numbers 31:16'>31:16</a> , the incident was brought about by the counsel of Balaam. Failing to be able to curse Israel, he gave the Moabites and Midianites direction in how to provoke Yahweh’s anger against His people. <a ref='Numbers 25:1'>25:1</a> <b>Shittim.</b> The region across the Jordan River from Jericho where Israel invaded the land of Canaan (see <a ref='Joshua 2:1'>Jos 2:1</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 25:3'>25:3</a> <b>joined themselves to Baal of Peor.</b> Israel engaged in acts of sexual immorality with the women of Moab. Since this was part of the pagan cult that was worshiped by the Moabites, the Israelites joined in these idolatrous practices. The Israelites yoked themselves to the false god of the Moabites and the Midianites, referred to as Baal of Peor. This was a violation of the first commandment. <a ref='Numbers 25:6'>25:6</a> Cf. vv. <a ref='Numbers 25:14–15'>14–15</a> . <a ref='Numbers 25:9'>25:9</a> <b>24,000.</b> This is to be differentiated from the plague over the golden calf where 23,000 died (cf. <a ref='Exodus 32:1–14'>Ex 32:1–14</a> , <a ref='Exodus 32:28'>28</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:8'>1Co 10:8</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 25:10–13'>25:10–13</a> Because of Phinehas’ zeal for God’s holiness, Yahweh made “a covenant of a perpetual priesthood” with him so that through his family line would come all future, legitimate High Priests (cf. <a ref='Psalms 106:30–31'>Ps 106:30–31</a> ). This promise will extend even into the millennial kingdom (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:46'>Eze 40:46</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 44:10'>44:10</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 44:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 48:11'>48:11</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 25:17'>25:17</a> <b>Be hostile to the Midianites.</b> Because the Midianites had attacked Israel by their schemes of sexual and idolatrous seduction, Yahweh called Israel to attack them in return. This attack is recorded in <a ref='Numbers 31:1–24'>31:1–24</a> . <a ref='Numbers 26:1–36:13'>26:1—36:13</a> The final major section of Numbers records the renewed obedience of Israel. God continued to speak ( <a ref='Numbers 26:1–2'>26:1–2</a> , <a ref='Numbers 26:52'>52</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 27:6'>27:6</a> , <a ref='Numbers 27:12'>12</a> , <a ref='Numbers 27:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 28:1'>28:1</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 31:1'>31:1</a> , <a ref='Numbers 31:25'>25</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 33:50'>33:50</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 34:1'>34:1</a> , <a ref='Numbers 34:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 35:1'>35:1</a> , <a ref='Numbers 35:9'>9</a> ), and the second generation of Israel obeyed. Most of the commandments in this section related to Israel’s life after they entered the Land. <a ref='Numbers 26:1–32:42'>26:1—32:42</a> These chapters begin and end speaking of going to war ( <a ref='Numbers 26:2'>26:2</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 32:20'>32:20</a> , <a ref='Numbers 32:29'>29</a> , <a ref='Numbers 32:32'>32</a> ) and the ensuing inheritance of Canaan ( <a ref='Numbers 26:52–56'>26:52–56</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 32:32'>32:32</a> ). Israel was being prepared for the conquest of the Promised Land. <a ref='Numbers 26:1–51'>26:1–51</a> This second census, like the first taken over 38 years earlier ( <a ref='Numbers 1:1–46'>1:1–46</a> ), counted all the men 20 years of age and older, fit for military service. <a ref='Numbers 26:5–51'>26:5–51</a> The numbers for each tribe with the net gain or loss were as follows: Reuben 43,730 (v. <a ref='Numbers 26:7'>7</a> ) −2,770 Simeon 22,200 (v. <a ref='Numbers 26:14'>14</a> ) −37,100 Gad 40,500 (v. <a ref='Numbers 26:18'>18</a> ) −5,150 Judah 76,500 (v. <a ref='Numbers 26:22'>22</a> ) +1,900 Issachar 64,300 (v. <a ref='Numbers 26:25'>25</a> ) +9,900 Zebulun 60,500 (v. <a ref='Numbers 26:27'>27</a> ) +3,100 Manasseh 52,700 (v. <a ref='Numbers 26:34'>34</a> ) +20,500 Ephraim 32,500 (v. <a ref='Numbers 26:37'>37</a> ) −8,000 Benjamin 45,600 (v. <a ref='Numbers 26:41'>41</a> ) +10,200 Dan 64,400 (v. <a ref='Numbers 26:43'>43</a> ) +1,700 Asher 53,400 (v. <a ref='Numbers 26:47'>47</a> ) +11,900 Naphtali 45,400 (v. <a ref='Numbers 26:50'>50</a> ) −8,000 Total 601,730 (v. <a ref='Numbers 26:51'>51</a> ) −1,820 The great decline in the tribe of Simeon might be due to its participation in the sin of Baal of Peor (see <a ref='Numbers 25:14'>25:14</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 26:9'>26:9</a> <b>Dathan and Abiram.</b> These were singled out for special mention because of their part in the rebellion recorded in <a ref='Numbers 16:1–40'>16:1–40</a> . Mention of them was a reminder of God’s judgment against rebellion. <a ref='Numbers 26:11'>26:11</a> <b>The sons of Korah.</b> These sons of Korah were spared judgment because they separated themselves from their father’s house (see <a ref='Numbers 16:26'>16:26</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 26:19'>26:19</a> <b>Er and Onan.</b> These two sons of Judah did not receive an inheritance in the land because of their great evil (see <a ref='Genesis 38:1–10'>Ge 38:1–10</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 26:33'>26:33</a> <b>Zelophehad.</b> The mentioning of Zelophehad having no sons, but only daughters, laid the basis for the laws of inheritance stated in <a ref='Numbers 27:1–11'>27:1–11</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 36:1–12'>36:1–12</a> . <a ref='Numbers 26:52–56'>26:52–56</a> These census numbers would be used to decide the size of each tribe’s inheritance in the land. The exact locations would be determined by lot (see <a ref='Joshua 13:1–7'>Jos 13:1–7</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 14:1–19:51'>14:1—19:51</a> for the outworking of these words). <a ref='Numbers 26:57–65'>26:57–65</a> As in the first census ( <a ref='Numbers 3:14–39'>3:14–39</a> ), the Levites were counted separately. The total number of Levites was 23,000 (v. <a ref='Numbers 26:62'>62</a> ), an increase of 1,000 over the previous census (see <a ref='Numbers 3:39'>3:39</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 27:1–11'>27:1–11</a> The coming distribution of the land of Canaan presented a dilemma for the family of Zelophehad since he had no sons. His 5 daughters boldly asked that they inherit their father’s name and his inheritance (vv. <a ref='Numbers 27:1–4'>1–4</a> ). Yahweh’s decision that the daughters should receive his inheritance became the basis of a perpetual statute in Israel governing inheritances (vv. <a ref='Numbers 27:5–11'>5–11</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 27:3'>27:3</a> <b>he died in his own sin.</b> Zelophehad had not been involved in Korah’s rebellion. Instead, he had died under God’s judgment in the wilderness, like the rest of the faithless Exodus generation. <a ref='Numbers 27:8–11'>27:8–11</a> The following is the order of inheritance: son, daughter, brother, paternal uncle, and closest relative in the family. This same order (with the exception of the daughter) was followed in <a ref='Leviticus 25:48–49'>Lv 25:48–49</a> dealing with the various cases of redemption of the land in the Jubilee year. <a ref='Numbers 27:12–14'>27:12–14</a> God reaffirmed that Moses could not enter the land of Canaan, although he was able to see it from Mt. Nebo, across from Jericho (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:49'>Dt 32:49</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 27:15–17'>27:15–17</a> Moses’ greatest concern was that Israel have a good leader who was like a shepherd. Yahweh answered his request in the man Joshua. <a ref='Numbers 27:18'>27:18</a> <b>lay your hand on him.</b> Joshua already had the inner endowment for leadership. He was empowered by the Holy Spirit. This inner endowment was to be recognized by an external ceremony. Moses publicly laid his hands upon Joshua. This act signified the transfer of Moses’ leadership to Joshua. The laying on of hands can accompany a dedication to an office (see <a ref='Numbers 8:10'>Nu 8:10</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 27:20'>27:20</a> <b>put some of your splendor.</b> Moses was to pass on some of the “honor” or “majesty” that he had to Joshua. See <a ref='Joshua 3:7'>Jos 3:7</a> . <a ref='Numbers 27:21'>27:21</a> <b>Eleazar … shall inquire for him.</b> Moses had been able to communicate directly with God ( <a ref='Numbers 12:8'>12:8</a> ), but Joshua would receive the Word from Yahweh through the High Priest. <b>Urim.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Exodus 28:30'>Ex 28:30</a></i> for this part of the High Priest’s breastpiece ( <a ref='Exodus 39:8–21'>Ex 39:8–21</a> ) as a means of determining God’s will (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:8'>Dt 33:8</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 28:6'>1Sa 28:6</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 28:1–29:40'>28:1—29:40</a> Instructions concerning the regular celebrations in Israel’s worship calendar had been given previously. Now, poised to enter the land, Moses gave an orderly reiteration and summary of the regular offerings for each time of celebration, adding some additional offerings. <a ref='Numbers 28:3–8'>28:3–8</a> See <a ref='Exodus 29:38–42'>Ex 29:38–42</a> . <a ref='Numbers 28:9–10'>28:9–10</a> These were newly revealed offerings for the Sabbath. <a ref='Numbers 28:11–15'>28:11–15</a> These were newly revealed offerings for the “beginning of … your months.” <a ref='Numbers 28:16–25'>28:16–25</a> See <a ref='Leviticus 23:5–8'>Lv 23:5–8</a> . <a ref='Numbers 28:26–31'>28:26–31</a> See <a ref='Leviticus 23:18'>Lv 23:18</a> . <a ref='Numbers 29:1–6'>29:1–6</a> See <a ref='Leviticus 23:23–25'>Lv 23:23–25</a> . <a ref='Numbers 29:7–11'>29:7–11</a> See <a ref='Leviticus 23:26–32'>Lv 23:26–32</a> . <a ref='Numbers 29:12–38'>29:12–38</a> See <a ref='Leviticus 23:33–43'>Lv 23:33–43</a> . <a ref='Numbers 30:1–16'>30:1–16</a> This chapter added clarification to the laws regarding vows given in <a ref='Leviticus 27:1–33'>Lv 27:1–33</a> . The basic principle for men is restated in v. <a ref='Numbers 30:2'>2</a> . Then, it was asserted that a man was also responsible for the vows made by women in his household (vv. <a ref='Numbers 30:3–16'>3–16</a> ). A father or husband could overrule the vow of a daughter or wife, but a man’s silence, if he knew of the vow, meant it must be accomplished. <a ref='Numbers 30:2'>30:2</a> <b>a vow. … binding obligation.</b> A promise to do something or a promise not to do something. Christ could have had this text in mind ( <a ref='Matthew 5:33'>Mt 5:33</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 30:9'>30:9</a> <b>a widow or. … divorced woman.</b> These were not viewed as being under a man’s authority, so the word of the woman alone sufficed. <a ref='Numbers 31:1–54'>31:1–54</a> This chapter has many links with previous passages in Numbers: vengeance on Midian (vv. <a ref='Numbers 31:2–3'>2–3</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 25:17–18'>25:17–18</a> ); Zur the Midianite (v. <a ref='Numbers 31:8'>8</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 25:15'>25:15</a> ); Balaam (vv. <a ref='Numbers 31:8'>8</a> , <a ref='Numbers 31:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 22:2–24:25'>22:2—24:25</a> ); Peor (v. <a ref='Numbers 31:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 25:1–9'>25:1–9</a> , <a ref='Numbers 25:14–15'>14–15</a> ); purification after contact with the dead (vv. <a ref='Numbers 31:19–24'>19–24</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 19:11–19'>19:11–19</a> ); care for the priests and Levites (vv. <a ref='Numbers 31:28–47'>28–47</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 18:8–32'>18:8–32</a> ). This battle with the Midianites modeled God’s requirements for holy war when Israel took vengeance on His enemies (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:1–18'>Dt 20:1–18</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 31:1–11'>31:1–11</a> Israel was commanded by Yahweh to take vengeance on Midian because they were responsible for corrupting Israel at Peor ( <a ref='Numbers 25:1–18'>25:1–18</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 31:2'>31:2</a> <b>gathered to your people.</b> A euphemism for death (see <a ref='Genesis 25:8'>Ge 25:8</a> , <a ref='Genesis 25:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 35:29'>35:29</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 31:12–24'>31:12–24</a> All the Midianites, except the virgin women, were to be put to death. Both the soldiers and the spoil needed to be cleansed. <a ref='Numbers 31:17'>31:17</a> The execution of all male children and women of childbearing age ensured the extermination of the Midianites and prevented them from ever again seducing Israel to sin. Reference to Midianites later ( <a ref='Judges 6:1–6'>Jdg 6:1–6</a> ) was to a different clan. It was the Midianites living in Moab who were destroyed here. <a ref='Numbers 31:25–54'>31:25–54</a> The plunder was divided equally between those who went and fought and those who stayed. <a ref='Numbers 32:1–42'>32:1–42</a> The tribes of Reuben and Gad desired to live in the land already conquered because they possessed much livestock and the land was good for grazing. Moses gave them, along with the half tribe of Manasseh, portions of the land only on the condition that they would fully participate in the conquest of Canaan. <a ref='Numbers 32:3'>32:3</a> <b>Ataroth … Beon.</b> The places mentioned here cannot be identified, but all lie between the Arnon River to the south and the Jabbok River to the north. <a ref='Numbers 32:8'>32:8</a> <b>This is what your fathers did.</b> Moses feared that if these two tribes were comfortably settled, they would not join with the other 10 tribes in conquering Canaan, and that could be the beginning of a general revolt against entering the land. As the 10 spies had dissuaded the people at Kadesh nearly 40 years earlier from conquering the land (vv. <a ref='Numbers 32:9–13'>9–13</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 13:26–14:4'>13:26—14:4</a> ), the refusal of these two tribes could cause the people to fail again (v. <a ref='Numbers 32:15'>15</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 32:23'>32:23</a> <b>your sin will find you out.</b> The two tribes committed themselves to provide their warriors for the conquest of the land. This agreement satisfied Moses, although he added that nonparticipation would be sin, and God would certainly find and judge the tribes for their sin. <a ref='Numbers 32:33'>32:33</a> <b>half-tribe of … Manasseh.</b> Once the agreement was reached with Reuben and Gad concerning settlement on the east side of the Jordan, the half tribe of Manasseh, also rich with flocks, joined in seeking land in that territory. However, vv. <a ref='Numbers 32:39–42'>39–42</a> indicate that Manasseh conquered cities not yet taken and settled in the northern area of Gilead. <a ref='Numbers 33:1–49'>33:1–49</a> Yahweh commanded Moses to write a list of Israel’s encampments between Egypt and the plains of Moab. Significantly, 40 places were mentioned (not including Rameses and the plains of Moab), reflecting the 40 years spent in the wilderness. Some sites recorded earlier are not listed, and other sites are only mentioned here. The God who would lead the Israelites in the conquest of Canaan ( <a ref='Numbers 33:50–56'>33:50–56</a> ) was the One who had led them through the wilderness. From the Wilderness to Canaan The attempt 40 years earlier to move from Kadesh-barnea north into Canaan had been rebuffed. This time Moses wanted to go east through Edom and north through Moab toward Canaan. However, the Hebrews were refused passage through both territories despite kinship with the peoples. Instead, Moses went south to Elath, then north and east, bypassing Edom and Moab. North of the Arnon River, they defeated the Amorites and were poised to cross the Jordan from the east to enter Canaan. Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Numbers 33:50–36:13'>33:50—36:13</a> The Promised Land had been Israel’s goal from the beginning of Numbers. This last part of the book anticipated the settlement of Canaan. <a ref='Numbers 33:50–56'>33:50–56</a> God commanded that all of the Canaanites were to be exterminated, along with all their idolatrous symbols. <a ref='Numbers 33:52'>33:52</a> <b>their high places.</b> Hills on which Canaanite altars and shrines were placed. <a ref='Numbers 33:56'>33:56</a> <b>as I plan to do to them, so I will do to you.</b> If Israel failed to obey God, she would be the object of God’s punishment in exactly the same way as the Canaanites were. <a ref='Numbers 34:1–15'>34:1–15</a> God gave precise instruction to Israel concerning the boundaries of the land of Canaan. Sadly, the actual conquest of the land fell far short of these boundaries. <a ref='Numbers 34:13'>34:13</a> <b>give to the nine and a half tribes.</b> The land to be conquered was to be given to the 9 1/2 tribes. The other 2 1/2 tribes already had their inheritance in Transjordan ( <a ref='Numbers 32:1–42'>32:1–42</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 34:16–29'>34:16–29</a> Yahweh appointed the men who were to assign the portions of the land of Canaan: Eleazar the priest ( <a ref='Numbers 20:25–26'>20:25–26</a> ), Joshua the commander ( <a ref='Numbers 27:18–23'>27:18–23</a> ), and the leaders of each of the 10 tribes which were to receive an inheritance. None of these men were sons of the leaders listed in <a ref='Numbers 1:5–15'>1:5–15</a> . <a ref='Numbers 35:1–8'>35:1–8</a> Forty-eight cities throughout the land were to be given to the Levites. The tribe of Levi did not receive a tribal allotment, but lived among the other tribes. <a ref='Joshua 21:1–42'>Joshua 21:1–42</a> gave the list of these 48 cities. <a ref='Numbers 35:2'>35:2</a> <b>from the inheritance of their possession.</b> According to <a ref='Numbers 18:23'>18:23</a> , the Levites were to have no land as inheritance in Canaan, so the Levites did not inherit these towns; they only lived in them. <b>pasture lands around the cities.</b> The Levites were also given grazing land around the cities so that their animals might feed. <a ref='Numbers 35:9–34'>35:9–34</a> Six of the Levitical cities were to be established as “cities of refuge” (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:1–13'>Dt 19:1–13</a> ). These cities were to be havens giving protection to any person who accidentally killed another person (manslaughter). <a ref='Numbers 35:12'>35:12</a> <b>the avenger.</b> The meaning of this term is “near of kin.” It refers to the person chosen by a family to deal with a loss suffered in that family. Here the close relative of a homicide victim would seek to avenge his death, but not until proper judgment was made. <a ref='Numbers 35:19'>35:19</a> Swift retribution according to the law of <a ref='Genesis 9:5–6'>Ge 9:5–6</a> . <a ref='Numbers 35:24'>35:24</a> <b>judge between the slayer and the blood avenger.</b> The congregation was called to decide the motive of the killer, whether it was with or without hostility. If there was evil intent, the killer was turned over to the avenger to be put to death. If, however, hostility could not be proven to exist between the killer and the victim, then the killer was allowed to remain in the city of refuge. <a ref='Numbers 35:25'>35:25</a> <b>until the death of the high priest.</b> The manslayer without evil intent was to remain in the city of refuge until the death of the High Priest. The death of the High Priest marked the end of an old era and the beginning of a new one for the manslayer. <a ref='Numbers 35:30'>35:30</a> <b>witnesses.</b> No one could be judged guilty of death on the testimony of only one witness. Two or more witnesses were required in all capital cases (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:6'>Dt 17:6</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:15'>19:15</a> ). <a ref='Numbers 35:33'>35:33</a> <b>blood pollutes the land.</b> Though murder and inadvertent killing polluted the land, murder was atoned for by the death of the murderer. Failure to observe these principles would make the land unclean. If the whole land became unclean, then Yahweh would no longer be able to dwell in their midst. <a ref='Numbers 36:1–13'>36:1–13</a> The issue raised here stemmed from a decision regarding female inheritance in <a ref='Numbers 27:1–11'>27:1–11</a> . Since a tribe would lose an allotted inheritance in the year of Jubilee if an inheriting woman had married into another tribe, the woman of any tribe who inherited land must marry within her own tribe. <a ref='Numbers 36:12'>36:12</a> <b>married</b> those <b>from … Manasseh.</b> The daughters of Zelophehad exemplified the obedience to God’s commandments that should have been practiced by all of Israel. Their inheritance was a direct result of their obedience to Yahweh—a basic lesson stressed throughout the whole book of Numbers.",
