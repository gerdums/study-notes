    "content": "The Book of Zechariah Title The universal tradition of both Jews and Christians endorses the prophet Zechariah as author. His name, common to more than 29 OT men, means “The Lord remembers.” This book is second only to Isaiah in the breadth of the prophets’ writings about Messiah. Author and Date Like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Zechariah was also a priest ( <a ref='Nehemiah 12:12–16'>Ne 12:12–16</a> ). According to tradition, he was a member of the Great Synagogue, a council of 120 originated by Nehemiah and presided over by Ezra. This council later developed into the ruling elders of the nation, called the Sanhedrin. He was born in Babylon and joined his grandfather, Iddo, in the group of exiles who first returned to Jerusalem under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Joshua the High Priest (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 12:4'>Ne 12:4</a> ). Because he is occasionally mentioned as the son of his grandfather (cf. <a ref='Ezra 5:1'>Ezr 5:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 6:14'>6:14</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 12:16'>Ne 12:16</a> ), it is thought that his father, Berechiah, died at an early age before he could succeed his father into the priesthood. Zechariah’s opening words are dated from 520 BC, the second year of Darius I (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 1:1'>1:1</a> ). The Persian emperor Cyrus had died and was succeeded by Cambyses (ca. 530–521 BC) who conquered Egypt. He had no son, he killed himself, and Darius rose to the throne by quelling a revolution. He was a contemporary of Haggai, and began his prophesying 2 months after him (cf. Haggai Introduction ). He is called a young man in <a ref='Zechariah 2:4'>2:4</a> , suggesting that Zechariah was younger than Haggai. The length of his ministry is uncertain; the last dated prophecy ( <a ref='Zechariah 7:1'>7:1</a> ) came approximately two years after the first, making them identical in time with Haggai’s prophecy (520–518 BC). Chapters <a ref='Zec 9-14'>9–14</a> are generally thought to come from a later period of his ministry. Differences in style and references to Greece indicate a date of ca. 480–470 BC, after Darius I (ca. 521–486 BC) and during Xerxes’ reign (ca. 486–464 BC), the king who made Esther queen of Persia. According to <a ref='Matthew 23:35'>Mt 23:35</a> , he was murdered between the temple and the altar, a fate similar to an earlier Zechariah (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 24:20–21'>2Chr 24:20–21</a> ), who had been stoned to death. Background and Setting The historical background and setting of Zechariah are the same as that of his contemporary, Haggai (cf. Haggai Introduction ). In 538 BC, Cyrus the Persian freed the captives from Israel to resettle their homeland (cf. <a ref='Ezra 1:1–4'>Ezr 1:1–4</a> ) and about 50,000 returned from Babylon. They immediately began to rebuild the temple (cf. <a ref='Ezra 3:1–4:5'>Ezr 3:1—4:5</a> ), but opposition from neighbors, followed by indifference from within, caused the work to be abandoned (cf. <a ref='Ezra 4:24'>Ezr 4:24</a> ). Sixteen years later (cf. <a ref='Ezra 5:1–2'>Ezr 5:1–2</a> ), Zechariah and Haggai were commissioned by the Lord to stir up the people to rebuild the temple. As a result, the temple was completed 4 years later in 516 BC ( <a ref='Ezra 6:15'>Ezr 6:15</a> ). Historical and Theological Themes Zechariah joined Haggai in rousing the people from their indifference, challenging them to resume the building of the temple. Haggai’s primary purpose was to rebuild the temple; his preaching has a tone of rebuke for the people’s indifference, sin, and lack of trust in God. He was used to start the revival, while Zechariah was used to keep it going strong with a more positive emphasis, calling the people to repentance and reassuring them regarding future blessings. Zechariah sought to encourage the people to build the temple in view of the promise that someday Messiah would come to inhabit it. The people were not just building for the present, but with the future hope of Messiah in mind. He encouraged the people, still downtrodden by the Gentile powers ( <a ref='Zechariah 1:8–12'>1:8–12</a> ), with the reality that the Lord remembers His covenant promises to them and that He would restore and bless them. Thus the name of the book (which means “The Lord remembers”) contains in seed form the theme of the prophecy. This “apocalypse of the OT” as it is often called, relates both to Zechariah’s immediate audience as well as to the future. This is borne out in the structure of the prophecy itself, since in each of the 3 major sections (chaps. <a ref='Zec 1-6'>1–6</a> , <a ref='Zec 7-8'>7–8</a> , <a ref='Zec 9-14'>9–14</a> ), the prophet begins historically and then moves forward to the time of the Second Advent, when Messiah returns to His temple to set up His earthly kingdom. The prophet reminded the people that Messiah had both an immediate and long-term commitment to His people. Thus the prophet’s words were “good words, comforting words” ( <a ref='Zechariah 1:13'>1:13</a> ), both to the exiles of Zechariah’s day as well as to the remnant of God’s chosen people in that future day. This book is the most messianic, apocalyptic, and eschatological in the OT. Primarily, it is a prophecy about Jesus Christ, focusing on His coming glory as a means to comfort Israel (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 1:13'>1:13</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 1:17'>17</a> ). While the book is filled with visions, prophecies, signs, celestial visitors, and the voice of God, it is also practical, dealing with issues like repentance, divine care, salvation, and holy living. Prophecy was soon to be silent for more than 400 years until John the Baptist, so God used Zechariah to bring a rich, abundant outburst of promise for the future to sustain the faithful remnant through those silent years. Interpretive Challenges While there are numerous challenges to the reader, two passages within the prophecy present notable interpretive difficulty. In <a ref='Zechariah 11:8'>11:8</a> , the Good Shepherd “annihilated the three shepherds in one month.” The presence of the definite article points to familiarity, so that the Jews would have understood the identity of these shepherds without further reference. It is not so easy for modern readers to understand. Numerous alternatives concerning their identity have been suggested. One of the oldest views, and probably the correct one, identifies them as three orders of leaders: the priests, elders, and scribes of Israel. During His earthly ministry, Jesus also confronted the hypocrisy of Israel’s religious leaders (cf. <a ref='Mt 23'>Mt 23</a> ), disowning them with scathing denunciations, followed by destruction of the whole nation in AD 70. Since His coming, the Jewish people have had no other prophet, priest, or king. Considerable discussion also surrounds the identity of the individual who possessed “wounds struck <i>here</i> between your arms” ( <a ref='Zechariah 13:6'>13:6</a> ). Some have identified him with Christ, the wounds supposedly referring to His crucifixion. But Christ could neither have denied that He was a prophet, nor could He have claimed that He was a farmer, or that He was wounded in the house of His friends. Obviously, it is a reference to a false prophet (cf. vv. <a ref='Zechariah 13:4–5'>4–5</a> ) who was wounded in his idolatrous worship. The zeal for the Lord will be so great in the kingdom of Messiah that idolaters will make every attempt to hide their true identity, but their scars will be the telltale evidence of their iniquity.

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Zechariah 1:1–6'>1:1–6</a> The opening 6 verses provide an introduction to the entire prophecy in which the prophet calls upon the people to repent and never again repeat the past sins of their fathers (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:11'>1Co 10:11</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>eighth month of the second year of Darius.</b> Ca. Oct./Nov. 520 BC. See Introduction: Author and Date . Zechariah began his ministry two months after the start of Haggai’s ministry (cf. <a ref='Haggai 1:1'>Hag 1:1</a> ) and the resumption of the rebuilding of the temple (cf. <a ref='Haggai 1:12–15'>Hag 1:12–15</a> ). Most OT prophets who dated their prophecies did so according to the reign of a king in Israel, Judah, or both. Haggai and Zechariah date their prophecies according to the reign of the Gentile king, indicating that the times of the Gentiles ( <a ref='Luke 21:24'>Lk 21:24</a> ) had begun. <b>Zechariah.</b> See Introduction: Author and Date . <a ref='Zechariah 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>Yahweh was very wrathful.</b> This actually means “to break out in long-controlled indignation,” reminding the people of the severity of God’s wrath and the necessity of His judgment on their past sins in pre-Exilic times. <a ref='Zechariah 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>Yahweh of hosts.</b> This frequently used name for God shows His might as the commander of the hosts, whether they are the armies of Israel (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 26:11'>2Chr 26:11</a> ), the armies of the heathen nations (cf. <a ref='Judges 4:2'>Jdg 4:2</a> ), or the heavenly inhabitants (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 22:19'>1Ki 22:19</a> ). <b>Return to Me.</b> Though primarily a book of consolation, the prophet begins with a call to repentance, to preclude any false security on the part of Israel, i.e., thinking that God would bless His chosen people regardless of their spiritual condition. This expresses the ongoing desire of God (cf. <a ref='Genesis 17:7'>Ge 17:7</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 26:12'>Lv 26:12</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 37:27'>Eze 37:27</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:16'>2Co 6:16</a> ; <a ref='James 4:8'>Jas 4:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 21:3'>Rev 21:3</a> ), and the constant condition for blessing. <a ref='Zechariah 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>Do not be like your fathers.</b> The disobedient, obstinate behavior of their fathers was not so much directed toward the prophets, but at God Himself. The people were well aware of their fathers’ sins (cf. <a ref='Ezra 9:7'>Ezr 9:7</a> ) and could look around them and see the results. History should have taught them to repent. <b>the former prophets.</b> A reference to the pre-Exilic prophets who all preached the same message of repentance before the Exile, e.g., Isaiah and Jeremiah. Cf. “My slaves” (v. <a ref='Zechariah 1:6'>6</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 1:5'>1:5</a> While both their fathers and the former prophets were dead, the legacy of their fathers’ failure to heed the prophets’ warnings was vividly before them, exemplified by the city of Jerusalem and the temple lying in ruins, needing to be rebuilt. <a ref='Zechariah 1:6'>1:6</a> God’s Word accomplishes all which He designs ( <a ref='Isaiah 55:10–11'>Is 55:10–11</a> ), in blessing and in judgment. His warnings, so precisely fulfilled, overtook and destroyed their fathers, who recognized God’s hand in the judgment (cf. <a ref='Lamentations 2:17'>Lam 2:17</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 9:6'>Ezr 9:6ff.</a> ). The Exile was positive proof that God punishes those who sin and reject His warnings. <b>they returned.</b> Cf. <a ref='Daniel 9:1–19'>Da 9:1–19</a> . <a ref='Zechariah 1:7–6:15'>1:7—6:15</a> God gave Zechariah these visions for the comfort of the post-Exilic remnant of Israel who had been commissioned to return from Persia to the land promised to Abraham (cf. <a ref='Ge 12'>Ge 12</a> ). They were to rebuild the temple (cf. 1 and 2Chr) and to anticipate the day of Messiah’s return, when all of God’s promises to Israel would finally, fully, and ultimately be fulfilled. Some portions of the visions have been fulfilled, but the large number await the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. The following summary will help to distinguish the contribution of individual visions and clarify the whole. Vision 1—Man among the myrtle trees ( <a ref='Zechariah 1:7–17'>1:7–17</a> ), God promises prosperity to Israel. Vision 2—Four horns and four craftsmen ( <a ref='Zechariah 1:18–21'>1:18–21</a> ), God judges the nations who attacked Israel. Vision 3—Man with a measuring line ( <a ref='Zechariah 2:1–13'>2:1–13</a> ), God rebuilds Jerusalem. Vision 4—Cleansing of the High Priest ( <a ref='Zechariah 3:1–10'>3:1–10</a> ), God purifies both High Priest and people. Vision 5—Golden lampstand and two olive trees ( <a ref='Zechariah 4:1–14'>4:1–14</a> ), God rebuilds the temple. Vision 6—Flying scroll ( <a ref='Zechariah 5:1–4'>5:1–4</a> ), God removes imparted sin/idolatry. Vision 7—Woman in basket ( <a ref='Zechariah 5:5–11'>5:5–11</a> ), God removes the system of false religion. Vision 8—Four chariots ( <a ref='Zechariah 6:1–8'>6:1–8</a> ), God brings peace and rest to Israel. Appendix—Coronation of the High Priest ( <a ref='Zechariah 6:9–15'>6:9–15</a> ), Messiah assumes the office of both King and Priest. <a ref='Zechariah 1:7–17'>1:7–17</a> This is the first of 8 night visions which Zechariah saw in a single night. It summarized all the other 7 by giving the general theme, leaving the details to the other visions. Reassuring words are provided to the exiles by revealing God’s purpose for the future of His chosen people. <a ref='Zechariah 1:7'>1:7</a> <b>the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month.</b> Ca. Jan./Feb. 519 BC. Approximately 3 months after Zechariah’s opening call to repentance. <a ref='Zechariah 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>I saw at night.</b> This is the first vision revealing God’s plan for Jerusalem, which begins with the sight of “a man … riding on a red horse.” The man is identified as the angel of Yahweh (cf. v. <a ref='Zechariah 1:11'>11</a> ). The other riders report to Him, indicating His authority over them. Because of the strength of horses, they became symbols of war. Red is often the symbol of blood, hence judgment (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 63:1–4'>Is 63:1–4</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 6:3'>Rev 6:3ff.</a> ). <b>among the myrtle trees … in the ravine.</b> Myrtle trees were associated with booth-making at the Feast of Booths, or Tabernacles ( <a ref='Leviticus 23:33–44'>Lv 23:33–44</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 8:15'>Ne 8:15</a> ), and with messianic blessing (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 41:19'>Is 41:19</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 55:13'>55:13</a> ), and thereby possibly speak of restoration and blessing. Their location in the ravine has been thought to refer to a low place where such shrubs would flourish. Because of the lowliness (these shrubs would never exceed 8 ft. in height), commonness, fragrance (from white blossoms), and abundance in flourishing places, it is best to see these as representing Israel, God’s people. They are the lowly and yet enriched people. Their lowliness in the ravine could also refer to Israel’s current humiliation. <b>red, sorrel, and white.</b> Presumably these other horses had riders as well. The colors may speak of the work of the riders: red speaking of bloodshed and judgment (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 63:1–2'>Is 63:1–2</a> ), white speaking of victory (cf. <a ref='Revelation 19:11'>Rev 19:11</a> ), and sorrel or a brownish color is possibly a combination of the others. A similar picture is found in <a ref='Revelation 6:1–8'>Rev 6:1–8</a> . These horses are about to gain a victorious judgment. Since they are messengers of vengeance, they likely represent angels, so frequently employed as God’s instruments of judgment. Zechariah’s Visions Vision Significance Man and horses among the myrtle trees ( <a ref='Zechariah 1:8'>1:8</a> ) The Lord will again be merciful to Jerusalem ( <a ref='Zechariah 1:14'>1:14</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 1:16–17'>16–17</a> ) Four horns, four craftsmen ( <a ref='Zechariah 1:18–20'>1:18–20</a> ) Those who scattered Judah are cast out ( <a ref='Zechariah 1:21'>1:21</a> ) Man with measuring line ( <a ref='Zechariah 2:1'>2:1</a> ) God will be a protective wall of fire around Jerusalem ( <a ref='Zechariah 2:3–5'>2:3–5</a> ) Cleansing of Joshua ( <a ref='Zechariah 3:4'>3:4</a> ) The Servant, the Branch, comes to save ( <a ref='Zechariah 3:8–9'>3:8–9</a> ) Golden lampstand and olive trees ( <a ref='Zechariah 4:2–3'>4:2–3</a> ) The Lord empowers Israel by His Spirit ( <a ref='Zechariah 4:6'>4:6</a> ) Flying scroll ( <a ref='Zechariah 5:1'>5:1</a> ) Dishonesty is cursed ( <a ref='Zechariah 5:3'>5:3</a> ) Woman in the basket ( <a ref='Zechariah 5:6–7'>5:6–7</a> ) Wickedness will be removed ( <a ref='Zechariah 5:9'>5:9</a> ) Four chariots ( <a ref='Zechariah 6:1'>6:1</a> ) The spirits of heaven execute judgment on the whole earth ( <a ref='Zechariah 6:5'>6:5</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 6:7'>7</a> ) Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Zechariah 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>the angel who was speaking with me.</b> This interpreting angel ( <a ref='Zechariah 1:13–14'>1:13–14</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 1:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 2:3'>2:3</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 3:1'>3:1</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 4:1'>4:1</a> ) is to be distinguished from the angel of Yahweh (vv. <a ref='Zechariah 1:11–12'>11–12</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 1:10'>1:10</a> <b>patrol.</b> A symbolic military description of angelic movement patrolling and reconnoitering on a global scale. The purpose is to ascertain the state of the enemy and to respond to God’s will in engaging that enemy triumphantly. <a ref='Zechariah 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>the angel of Yahweh.</b> Elsewhere the angel of Yahweh is frequently identified with the pre-incarnate Lord Himself (e.g., <a ref='Genesis 16:11–13'>Ge 16:11–13</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 18:1–2'>18:1–2</a> , <a ref='Genesis 18:13'>13</a> , <a ref='Genesis 18:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 22:11–18'>22:11–18</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 3:2'>Ex 3:2</a> , <a ref='Exodus 3:4'>4</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 5:13'>Jos 5:13</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 6:2'>6:2</a> ; <a ref='Judges 6:12'>Jdg 6:12</a> , <a ref='Judges 6:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Judges 13:21–22'>13:21–22</a> ). In v. <a ref='Zechariah 1:13'>13</a> , this Angel is called Lord, and is the divine Commander-in-Chief of this angelic army. <b>all the earth is sitting</b> still <b>and quiet.</b> In contrast to the difficulties facing the exiles, without temple or city walls, the heathen nations were superficially at rest, occupied with their own selfish interests (cf. v. <a ref='Zechariah 1:15'>15</a> ). This was generally the condition in the second year of Darius. The contrast makes the plight of Israel all the more distressing and the hope for the fulfillment of <a ref='Haggai 2:7'>Hag 2:7</a> , <a ref='Haggai 2:22'>22</a> more intense. <a ref='Zechariah 1:12'>1:12</a> The angel of Yahweh interceded to God the Father on behalf of Israel, pleading for the withdrawal of God’s chastening hand. The “seventy years” refers to God’s words to Jeremiah concerning the length of Judah’s exile ( <a ref='Jeremiah 25:11–12'>Jer 25:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 29:10'>29:10</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>good … comforting words.</b> The content of these words is given in vv. <a ref='Zechariah 1:14–17'>14–17</a> : God still loved Jerusalem (v. <a ref='Zechariah 1:14'>14</a> ), He was angry with the nations who afflicted them (v. <a ref='Zechariah 1:15'>15</a> ), and He will bring prosperity to Jerusalem (vv. <a ref='Zechariah 1:16–17'>16–17</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 1:14'>1:14</a> <b>I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem.</b> God first described Himself as jealous when making His covenant with Israel ( <a ref='Exodus 20:5'>Ex 20:5</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 34:14'>34:14</a> ). This same jealousy had been experienced by Israel in punishment (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:18–28'>Dt 29:18–28</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 5:13'>Eze 5:13</a> ). That same jealous love is expressed emphatically in the city’s defense. <a ref='Zechariah 1:15'>1:15</a> Moved by His great love for His people, Yahweh acted in anger (cf. v. <a ref='Zechariah 1:2'>2</a> ) against the nations which mistreated His people. Although they were His instrument of judgment against Israel, they had exceeded God’s instructions in meting out punishment. They did not understand that God’s intention was to punish for a time and then show compassion (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 54:7–8'>Is 54:7–8</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 1:16–17'>1:16–17</a> Not only would the temple be rebuilt, which at that time had only foundations (cf. <a ref='Haggai 2:18'>Hag 2:18</a> ), but the city itself would again expand due to the prosperity (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 40:9–10'>Is 40:9–10</a> ). The wall was completed 75 years later. God would again comfort Jerusalem (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 40:1–2'>Is 40:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 51:3'>51:3</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 51:12'>12</a> ) and would again choose it as the place of His earthly throne (cf. <a ref='Psalms 132:13'>Ps 132:13</a> ). This will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom of Messiah (cf. <a ref='Rev 20'>Rev 20</a> ). Given the fact that the returning Jews lost sight of their priorities (cf. <a ref='Haggai 1:1–12'>Hag 1:1–12</a> ), this message reaffirmed God’s plan. It should be noted that the millennial kingdom will provide the presence of God in Jerusalem ( <a ref='Ezekiel 48:35'>Eze 48:35</a> ), a glorious temple ( <a ref='Eze 40-48'>Eze 40–48</a> ), a rebuilt Jerusalem ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:38–40'>Jer 31:38–40</a> ), the nations punished ( <a ref='Matthew 25:31–46'>Mt 25:31–46</a> ), the prosperity of Judah’s cities ( <a ref='Isaiah 60:4–9'>Is 60:4–9</a> ), the blessedness of the people ( <a ref='Zechariah 9:17'>Zec 9:17</a> ), and the comfort of Zion ( <a ref='Isaiah 14:1'>Is 14:1</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 1:18–21'>1:18–21</a> The second of 8 night visions adds details to the judgment of the nations who persecuted His Israel, building upon God’s promise to comfort His people ( <a ref='Zechariah 1:13'>1:13</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 1:17'>17</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 1:18'>1:18</a> <b>four horns.</b> Horns were symbols of power and pride (cf. <a ref='Psalms 75:10'>Pss 75:10</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:17'>89:17</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 92:10'>92:10</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 7:24'>Da 7:24</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 8:20–21'>8:20–21</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:13'>Mic 4:13</a> ). In the context of judgment, each symbolizes either a nation or the head of that nation (cf. <a ref='Daniel 7:21'>Da 7:21</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:24'>24</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 8:3'>8:3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 17:12'>Rev 17:12</a> ). Here the horns represent nations that attacked God’s people (vv. <a ref='Zechariah 1:19'>19</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 1:21'>21</a> ), referring either to Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, and Medo-Persia or perhaps, more likely, to the 4 world empires of <a ref='Da 2'>Da 2</a> , <a ref='Da 7'>7</a> : Babylonia, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, all of which oppressed Israel. <a ref='Zechariah 1:20'>1:20</a> <b>four craftsmen.</b> The word is literally the term for stoneworkers, metal workers, and woodworkers—those who shape material with hammers and chisels. These “hammers” represent the nations which overthrow the 4 horns (v. <a ref='Zechariah 1:18'>18</a> ). As with the 4 beasts of <a ref='Da 7'>Da 7</a> , each empire is overthrown by the subsequent one, the last being replaced by Messiah’s kingdom (cf. <a ref='Daniel 2:44'>Da 2:44</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 7:9–14'>7:9–14</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:21–22'>21–22</a> ). Babylon was hammered in a night attack by the Medo-Persians (539 BC). With the victory of Alexander over Darius in 333 BC at Issus, the Greeks hammered the Medo-Persian “horn.” In the second century BC, the Roman hammer fell, and one by one the nations fell (Israel in 63 BC). The Roman Empire, revived in the last days, according to Daniel, will be hammered by the returning Messiah (cf. <a ref='Daniel 2:34–35'>Da 2:34–35</a> , <a ref='Daniel 2:45'>45</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 2:1–13'>2:1–13</a> The third vision reveals a man with a measuring line. Like the second vision, it also builds on God’s promise to comfort His people ( <a ref='Zechariah 1:13'>1:13</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 1:17'>17</a> ). The restoration of Jerusalem after the return from Babylon is only a foretaste of the future messianic kingdom, for the language of the vision cannot be fulfilled historically. Its scope extends beyond the time of Zechariah to the rule of the Messiah on earth. <a ref='Zechariah 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>a man with a measuring cord.</b> The restoration and rebuilding of Jerusalem are symbolized. It is very possible that the surveyor is the angel of Yahweh (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 1:11'>1:11</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 6:12'>6:12</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 40:2–3'>Eze 40:2–3</a> ), who is laying out the future dimensions of the city. <a ref='Zechariah 2:3'>2:3</a> <b>angel … was speaking with me.</b> This is the instructing angel of <a ref='Zechariah 1:9'>1:9</a> . <a ref='Zechariah 2:4'>2:4</a> The news was so wonderful that it was to be heralded immediately. An angel arrived to explain that Jerusalem will become so large that it will extend beyond any walls (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 49:19–20'>Is 49:19–20</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 38:11'>Eze 38:11</a> ). The conditions here described have at no time been true historically (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 7:4'>Ne 7:4</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 11:1–2'>11:1–2</a> ); full realization must be assigned to a future earthly kingdom (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 49:19–20'>Is 49:19–20</a> ). A counterfeit of this unwalled safety will exist under Antichrist in the time of tribulation ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Ezekiel 38:8–12'>Eze 38:8–12</a></i> ). <a ref='Zechariah 2:5'>2:5</a> <b>a wall of fire around her.</b> Though without walls, Jerusalem will dwell securely because of divine protection. The phrase is reminiscent of the pillar of fire at the Exodus (cf. <a ref='Exodus 13:21'>Ex 13:21</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 6:15–17'>2Ki 6:15–17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 4:5–6'>Is 4:5–6</a> ). <b>I will be the glory in her midst.</b> More than protection, the glory depicts the Messiah’s blessing and personal presence in His earthly kingdom (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 4:2–6'>Is 4:2–6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 40:5'>40:5</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:17–18'>60:17–18</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 42:1–7'>Eze 42:1–7</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 2:6–9'>2:6–9</a> The prophet turned from the distant future (vv. <a ref='Zechariah 2:4–5'>4–5</a> ) to the present, summoning those Israelites still in Babylon (referred to as the land of the north, cf. v. <a ref='Zechariah 2:7'>7</a> , because of the direction from which it invaded Israel) to flee before God poured out His judgment on it. This also implied a future call to leave a future Babylon (cf. <a ref='Revelation 17:3–5'>Rev 17:3–5</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 18:1–8'>18:1–8</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 2:6'>2:6</a> <b>I have dispersed you.</b> According to <a ref='2 Kings 17:6'>2Ki 17:6</a> , they were scattered from the Gozan River, 200 mi. west of Nineveh, to Media, 300 mi. east. Some had even taken refuge in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and Egypt (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 40:11–12'>Jer 40:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 43:7'>43:7</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 2:8'>2:8</a> <b>After glory He has sent Me.</b> The Messiah is sent by “Yahweh of hosts” (v. <a ref='Zechariah 2:9'>9</a> ) to procure His glory and to vindicate Him in the nations who have spoiled Israel. <b>the apple of His eye.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:10'>Dt 32:10</a> .</i> Harming God’s chosen people is like striking the pupil of God’s eye. <a ref='Zechariah 2:10–13'>2:10–13</a> The language is once again messianic, describing the personal presence of the Messiah, dwelling on the throne of David in Jerusalem during the Millennium. <a ref='Zechariah 2:11–12'>2:11–12</a> Echoing the promise to Abraham ( <a ref='Genesis 12:3'>Ge 12:3</a> ), many nations will join themselves to Yahweh (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 6:15'>6:15</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 8:20–23'>8:20–23</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 2:2–4'>Is 2:2–4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 56:6–7'>56:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:3'>60:3</a> ). But this will not alter God’s choice of His people, they will still be “His portion in the holy land” (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:9'>Dt 32:9</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 2:12'>2:12</a> <b>holy land.</b> Used only here, the expression is made not because it is the Promised Land, but because it will be the site of Messiah’s earthly throne when the land has been cleansed. A holy land is appropriate and expected for its holy Lord ( <a ref='Isaiah 6:1–5'>Is 6:1–5</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 2:13'>2:13</a> <b>His holy habitation.</b> God’s dwelling in heaven (cf. <a ref='Psalms 15:1'>Pss 15:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 24:3'>24:3</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 3:1–10'>3:1–10</a> The fourth night vision emphasizes Israel’s cleansing and restoration as a priestly nation. The vision itself is given in vv. <a ref='Zechariah 3:1–5'>1–5</a> , followed by the explanation and significance in vv. <a ref='Zechariah 3:6–10'>6–10</a> . The revealer was most likely God Himself. <a ref='Zechariah 3:1'>3:1</a> The scene is invested with a judicial character as Joshua, the High Priest of the restoration who came back in the first group with Zerubbabel (cf. <a ref='Ezra 3:2'>Ezr 3:2</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 5:2'>5:2</a> ; <a ref='Haggai 1:1'>Hag 1:1</a> ), was accused by Satan, who was standing at the right side, the place of accusation under the law (cf. <a ref='Psalms 109:6'>Ps 109:6</a> ). That Joshua was representative of the nation is evident from: 1) the emphasis on the nation in these visions; 2) the fact that the rebuke in v. <a ref='Zechariah 3:2'>2</a> is based on God’s choice of Jerusalem, not Joshua; 3) the identification in v. <a ref='Zechariah 3:8'>8</a> of Joshua and his fellow priests as symbolic of future Israel; and 4) its application to the land in v. <a ref='Zechariah 3:9'>9</a> . <b>Satan.</b> This could also be translated “adversary” and thus the person’s identity would be unknown. However, because the activity of accusation is so in keeping with Satan (cf. <a ref='Job 1-2'>Job 1–2</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:10'>Rev 12:10</a> ), his identification is preferable. The malicious adversary stands in the presence of Yahweh to proclaim Israel’s sins and their unworthiness of God’s favor. The situation is crucial: if Joshua is vindicated, Israel is accepted; if Joshua is rejected, Israel is rejected. The entire plan of God for the nation was revealed in the outcome. Israel’s hopes would either be destroyed or confirmed. <a ref='Zechariah 3:2'>3:2</a> <b>Yahweh said.</b> The angel of Yahweh is identified as Yahweh, thus verifying this “messenger” as deity. <i>See notes on <a ref='Zechariah 1:11'>1:11</a> ; <a ref='Judges 6:11'>Jdg 6:11</a> .</i> And the message was crucial in confirming that 1) God had not cast off the Jews, but was consistent with His covenants with them in Abraham and David, and 2) His election takes their side against Satan’s accusations. God will do this rebuking, as reported in <a ref='Revelation 20:10'>Rev 20:10</a> . <i>See note on <a ref='Jude 1:9'>Jd 9</a> .</i> <b>chosen Jerusalem.</b> God’s favor rested on Israel above any nation on earth (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:6–11'>Dt 7:6–11</a> ). He snatched them from potential disappearance in their captivity, like pulling a stick out of the fire just before it is torched (cf. <a ref='Amos 4:11'>Am 4:11</a> ). Thus, God confirmed His purposes for Israel, sweeping from Zechariah’s time to the consummation of human history (cf. <a ref='Revelation 12:3–17'>Rev 12:3–17</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 3:3'>3:3</a> <b>filthy garments.</b> Employing the most loathsome, vile term for filth, the phrase pictures the habitual condition of defilement of the priesthood and the people (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 4:4'>Is 4:4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 64:6'>64:6</a> ), which became the basis of Satan’s accusation that the nation is morally impure and unworthy of God’s protection and blessing. <a ref='Zechariah 3:4'>3:4</a> The removal of filthy garments by the angels (“who were standing before him”) depicted the promised future forensic justification, the salvation of the nation (cf. v. <a ref='Zechariah 3:9'>9</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–13:1'>12:10—13:1</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ). The High Priest was symbolically clothed with rich robes, which spoke of righteousness imputed (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 61:10'>Is 61:10</a> ) and the restoration of Israel to her original calling (cf. <a ref='Exodus 19:6'>Ex 19:6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 61:6'>Is 61:6</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:1–2'>Ro 11:1–2</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 3:5'>3:5</a> <b>a clean turban.</b> The turban, part of the High Priest’s dress, was inscribed with the words: “Holy to Yahweh” ( <a ref='Exodus 28:36–37'>Ex 28:36–37</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 39:30–31'>39:30–31</a> ). Zechariah joined the scene, calling for this because it strongly symbolized that Israel’s priestly place with God was restored. <a ref='Zechariah 3:6–7'>3:6–7</a> Although God will keep His promise to justify Israel, reinstate the nation as His priestly people to serve in His house, keep His courts, and have complete access to His presence—all based on His sovereign, electing love and not by merit or works of man—that will not be fulfilled until Israel is faithful to Yahweh. It awaits the fulfillment of <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–13:1'>12:10—13:1</a> . <a ref='Zechariah 3:8'>3:8</a> <b>men who are a wondrous sign.</b> The companion priests sitting before Joshua were symbols of future Israel, foreshadowing the coming Messiah. <b>My servant the Branch.</b> Two messianic phrases are here combined. “My Servant” is used by earlier prophets to depict the Messiah ( <a ref='Isaiah 42:1'>Is 42:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 49:3'>49:3</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 49:5'>5</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 52:13'>52:13</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 53:11'>53:11</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 34:23–24'>Eze 34:23–24</a> ) and speaks of His complete obedience and His humble estate. “Branch” also points to the Messiah (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 6:12–13'>6:12–13</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 4:2'>Is 4:2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:5'>Jer 23:5</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 33:15'>33:15</a> ) and denotes His rise from humble beginnings ( <a ref='Isaiah 11:1'>Is 11:1</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:5–6'>Jer 23:5–6</a> ) and His fruitfulness ( <a ref='Zechariah 6:12'>6:12</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:1'>Is 11:1</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 3:9'>3:9</a> <b>the stone.</b> Here is another reference to Messiah. In <a ref='Psalms 118:22–23'>Ps 118:22–23</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 8:13–15'>Is 8:13–15</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 28:16'>28:16</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 2:35'>Da 2:35</a> , <a ref='Daniel 2:45'>45</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 21:42'>Mt 21:42</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:19–22'>Eph 2:19–22</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:6–8'>1Pe 2:6–8</a> , He is a rejected stone, a stone of stumbling, a stone of refuge, a destroying stone, and a foundation stone. Here He is the precious foundation stone, with “seven eyes” symbolic of His omniscience and infinite intelligence (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 4:10'>4:10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:2'>Is 11:2</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:3'>Col 2:3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 5:6'>Rev 5:6</a> ). The engraving may be a reference to the cornerstone of the temple building, on which will be engraved an inscription attesting to the Divine Builder and the purpose for which the building was erected. As such, it is closely tied to the removal of “the iniquity of that land in one day,” symbolized by the removal of filthy garments in v. <a ref='Zechariah 3:4'>4</a> . The phrase looks to the future day when there will be cleansing and forgiveness for the nation as a whole ( <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–13:1'>12:10—13:1</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ), made possible through Christ’s redemptive provision at Calvary. <a ref='Zechariah 3:10'>3:10</a> <b>call for his neighbor to</b> sit <b>under.</b> A common expression in Israel for peace and prosperity (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 4:25'>1Ki 4:25</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:4'>Mic 4:4</a> ), here depicting the peace during the millennial rule of Messiah. <a ref='Zechariah 4:1–14'>4:1–14</a> The fourth vision focused on Joshua the High Priest and, by extension, the cleansing and restoration of the nation to her divinely appointed role as priest. This fifth vision focuses on the civil leader Zerubbabel, a descendant of David, to encourage him in the work of rebuilding the temple. The faithful completion of the work would then enable Israel to again bear light of God’s grace (testimony) to the world. <a ref='Zechariah 4:1'>4:1</a> <b>as a man who is roused.</b> Once again the interpreting angel comes to awaken the prophet out of spiritual exhaustion from the holy trauma of the previous vision. Cf. <a ref='Daniel 10:9'>Da 10:9</a> . <a ref='Zechariah 4:2'>4:2</a> <b>seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps.</b> The lampstand is the 7-branched kind used in the tabernacle, with the addition of a bowl on the top of it in order to maintain an abundant supply of oil and spouts to carry the oil to keep the 7 lamps burning. The picture is of an abundant supply. <a ref='Zechariah 4:3'>4:3</a> <b>two olive trees.</b> Olive oil was used in those days to fuel the lamps. The two olive trees supply oil to the bowl. The graphic picture is of limitless oil, supplied automatically without human agency, flowing from the trees down to the bowl, down to the lamps. <a ref='Zechariah 4:4'>4:4</a> <b>What are these.</b> Zechariah wanted to know the meaning of the two olive trees. Because of Zechariah’s priestly background, his query surprised the interpreting angel (v. <a ref='Zechariah 4:5'>5</a> ). His question goes unanswered until later (v. <a ref='Zechariah 4:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 4:6'>4:6</a> <b>This is the word of Yahweh to Zerubbabel.</b> The purpose of the vision was to encourage Zerubbabel to complete the temple rebuilding, to assure him of divine enablement for that venture and the endless supply for the future glory of Messiah’s kingdom and temple. The lampstand pictured Israel fully supplied by God to be His light then and in the future. It must be noted that the church has temporarily taken this role presently (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 5:8–9'>Eph 5:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 1:12–13'>Rev 1:12–13</a> , <a ref='Revelation 1:20'>20</a> ), until Israel’s salvation and restoration to covenant blessing and usefulness. Cf. <a ref='Romans 11:11–24'>Ro 11:11–24</a> . <b>Not by might … power, but by My Spirit.</b> Neither human might, wealth, or physical stamina would be sufficient to complete the work. Only an abundant supply of the power of the Holy Spirit, pictured by the “bowl” (v. <a ref='Zechariah 4:2'>2</a> ) would enable him to carry out the task, and enable Israel in the Messiah’s kingdom to be a light again to the world by the operation of the Spirit (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:24'>Eze 36:24</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 4:7'>4:7</a> <b>What are you, O great mountain?</b> Because the outcome is guaranteed (vv. <a ref='Zechariah 4:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 4:9'>9</a> ), any mountain-like opposition will be leveled by God to become like a flat surface. No obstacle will be able to stop the completion of the temple in Zerubbabel’s time or in the final kingdom of Messiah (cf. <a ref='Eze 40-48'>Eze 40–48</a> ). <b>the top stone.</b> The final stone of the building will be put into place, signifying its completion. <b>Grace, grace to it!</b> This blessing signifying shouts of joy and thanksgiving came to pass (cf. <a ref='Ezra 3:11–13'>Ezr 3:11–13</a> ) over the completion of the temple. Contrast this attitude with that of the people seeing the unfinished temple ( <a ref='Haggai 2:3'>Hag 2:3</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 4:9'>4:9</a> <b>me.</b> This is the angel of Yahweh ( <i>see note on <a ref='Zechariah 1:11'>1:11</a></i> ), the Protector, Deliverer, Defender of Israel, sent to bring this to fulfillment. In the future, He will come as Messiah to set up worship in the temple in His kingdom. <a ref='Zechariah 4:10'>4:10</a> <b>the day of small things.</b> Though the rebuilding of a temple smaller than Solomon’s may have been discouraging to some (cf. <a ref='Ezra 3:12'>Ezr 3:12</a> ; <a ref='Haggai 2:3'>Hag 2:3</a> ), Yahweh announced that His pleasure was upon this work, and that His omniscient care was watching over and taking pleasure in its completion. He said in effect, “Don’t despise what God is pleased with.” This was only a picture of the glorious restoration when Messiah comes to reign. That temple will make all others pale by comparison (cf. <a ref='Eze 40-48'>Eze 40–48</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 4:14'>4:14</a> <b>These are the two anointed ones.</b> The two olive trees (vv. <a ref='Zechariah 4:3'>3</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 4:11'>11</a> ) represent the kingly and priestly offices in Israel through which the blessing of God was to flow. The two olive branches (v. <a ref='Zechariah 4:12'>12</a> ) are the two men who occupied the supreme positions in those offices at that time: Zerubbabel, as a descendant of David, and Joshua, the High Priest, a descendant of Eleazar. Together, they foreshadow the Messiah, in whom these two offices are combined (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 6:13'>6:13</a> ; <a ref='Ps 110'>Ps 110</a> ) and who is the true source of blessing to make Israel the light to the nations (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 60:1–3'>Is 60:1–3</a> ). They had positions of responsibility in service to “Yahweh of all the earth,” a millennial term that points to the final kingdom (cf. <a ref='Micah 5:4'>Mic 5:4</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 5:1–4'>5:1–4</a> This sixth vision of the flying scroll depicts the Word of God which has been disobeyed by Israel and the entire world. It calls for God’s righteous judgment of the sinner according to His standard, clearly set forth in His Word. <a ref='Zechariah 5:1–2'>5:1–2</a> This flying scroll, unfurled for all to read both sides, measured 30 ft. long and 15 ft. wide (a cubit being 18 in.), exactly the size of the Holy Place in the tabernacle. The scroll represents, then, a divine standard by which man is to be measured. <a ref='Zechariah 5:3'>5:3</a> <b>curse.</b> The scroll, symbolizing the law of God, is a figure for a curse or punishment on all who disobeyed it and for blessing on all who obeyed it (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:26'>Dt 27:26</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:15–68'>28:15–68</a> ). A similar picture is presented in <a ref='Revelation 5:1–9'>Rev 5:1–9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 10:1–11'>10:1–11</a> . <b>everyone who steals … everyone who swears.</b> Written on both sides, the scroll probably contained the Ten Commandments, not just two. The two singled out, the third and eighth, are most likely representative of all commands of God’s law for which Israel was guilty of violations (cf. <a ref='James 2:10'>Jas 2:10</a> ). It has an immediate message to those of Zechariah’s time that God will root out and destroy the sinners who reject His Word; but it also has a future message for Israel and the world prior to Messiah’s kingdom (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:33–38'>Eze 20:33–38</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 25:31–46'>Mt 25:31–46</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 5:4'>5:4</a> There is no escape from the judgment of God. His Word will enter the place of sinners and remain there until it has accomplished its purpose ( <a ref='Isaiah 55:10–11'>Is 55:10–11</a> ), which will be particularly true in the kingdom. The promise of the land in <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:1–10'>Dt 30:1–10</a> will be fulfilled in the future day, as will consuming judgment (cf. <a ref='Rev 6-19'>Rev 6–19</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 5:5–11'>5:5–11</a> The previous vision dealt with the purging of sinners from the land. This seventh vision of a woman in a basket continues the theme, focusing on the removal of the whole sinful system from Israel, which will happen before the kingdom comes (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:38'>Eze 20:38</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 5:5–6'>5:5–6</a> The wicked system is represented as a basket with a woman held captive inside under a lead cover. An ephah (basket) was smaller than a bushel, holding about 5 gallons. Like the flying scroll (cf. vv. <a ref='Zechariah 5:1–4'>1–4</a> ), this was obviously enlarged for the purpose of the vision. The people of Israel are seen as pieces of grain, perhaps indicating that the wickedness is particularly materialistic. This was a sin that Israel picked up in Babylon, and it has influenced them through the centuries until removed by the Messiah in the last days. This secular commercialism is central to the final world system (cf. <a ref='Rev 18'>Rev 18</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 5:7–8'>5:7–8</a> <b>woman.</b> Inside the basket was sitting a woman, personifying this final wickedness (cf. <a ref='Revelation 17:3–5'>Rev 17:3–5</a> ), which is not dormant, since the lead cover is required to restrain it in the basket (cf. <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:6–8'>2Th 2:6–8</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 5:9'>5:9</a> <b>two women … wind in their wings.</b> Since storks are unclean birds ( <a ref='Leviticus 11:19'>Lv 11:19</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 14:18'>Dt 14:18</a> ) these must be agents of evil, demonic forces, protective of the wicked secularism, who set up the final system of evil. God allows them to set up the world system that Yahweh destroys when He returns (cf. <a ref='Revelation 19:11–16'>Rev 19:11–16</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 5:11'>5:11</a> <b>Shinar.</b> The destination of the women bearing the basket was Shinar, an older word designating Babylon (cf. <a ref='Genesis 10:10'>Ge 10:10</a> ). The older word is used possibly to recall the Tower of Babel as a symbol of opposition against God (cf. <a ref='Genesis 11:2'>Ge 11:2</a> ). There it will be placed in a “house” and set on a base or pedestal as an idol. Again the vision is unmistakably looking forward to the final Babylon of <a ref='Rev 17-18'>Rev 17–18</a> at the second coming of Christ (cf. <a ref='Malachi 4:1–3'>Mal 4:1–3</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 6:1–8'>6:1–8</a> The eighth and final vision completes the cycle and connects with the first vision. It pictures 4 chariots with the horses introduced in the first vision ( <a ref='Zechariah 1:8'>1:8</a> ), symbolizing God’s angelic agents (cf. v. <a ref='Zechariah 6:5'>5</a> ) swiftly carrying out His judgment on the nations just prior to the establishment of the messianic kingdom. <a ref='Zechariah 6:1'>6:1</a> <b>two mountains … bronze.</b> Representing the reality of God’s judgment on the nations who attack Israel, the two mountains are probably Mt. Zion and the Mt. of Olives, where Yahweh will return and judge (cf. <a ref='Joel 3:2'>Joel 3:2</a> , <a ref='Joel 3:12'>12</a> , <a ref='Joel 3:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:4'>Zec 14:4</a> ). This valley, called Jehoshaphat (“Jehovah judges”) could refer to the Kidron Valley between these two mountains. Jews, Christians, and even Muslims have long taught that the last judgment will be there. The bronze has a symbolic relationship to judgment as in the case of the bronze serpent ( <a ref='Numbers 21:9'>Nu 21:9</a> ) and/or the bronze altar ( <a ref='Exodus 27:2'>Ex 27:2</a> ), where sin was dealt with by God. <a ref='Zechariah 6:2–3'>6:2–3</a> The judgment scene is further dramatized by these chariots and horses. For the significance of the horses’ colors, <i>see note on <a ref='Zechariah 1:8'>1:8</a></i> . The addition of “black” horses may represent famine and death. The “sorrel” horse has been replaced with “dappled” (i.e., spotted) horses. A similar picture is found in <a ref='Revelation 6:1–8'>Rev 6:1–8</a> , where the horsemen of the apocalypse appear in judgment imagery, riding forth in vengeance on the nations. <a ref='Zechariah 6:5'>6:5</a> <b>four spirits of heaven.</b> This imagery represents divine angelic agents sent out to execute judgment on behalf of the “Lord of all the earth,” a millennial title designating the universal rule of the Messiah in the kingdom age (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 4:14'>4:14</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:13'>Mic 4:13</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 6:6–7'>6:6–7</a> <b>going … to patrol the earth.</b> These angelic judgment carriers unleash catastrophic judgment on the earth (cf. <a ref='Revelation 6:1–19:16'>Rev 6:1—19:16</a> for similarities). Nothing is said about going east and west because of the sea and the desert. Israel’s enemies came from the north (Assyria, Babylon, Seleucids, and Romans) and the south (Egyptians). This north, south exit leads to a worldwide unleashing of judgment on the nations all over the earth (cf. <a ref='Matthew 25:31–46'>Mt 25:31–46</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 6:8'>6:8</a> <b>caused My Spirit to have rest.</b> As a result of God’s judgment of His enemies, His wrath can rest. God has been avenged by this action, particularly in regard to the power from the north being judged finally. This likely refers to the final Babylon (cf. <a ref='Rev 17-18'>Rev 17–18</a> ). Until this judgment is done and God’s wrath rests, the kingdom can’t be established ( <a ref='Rev 19-20'>Rev 19–20</a> ) with the Messiah on His throne. <a ref='Zechariah 6:9–15'>6:9–15</a> Joshua served as an illustration of the Messiah in this passage in that Zechariah’s crowning of Joshua, the High Priest, was a miniature, advance illustration of the future coronation of Messiah, the Branch, who will unite the two offices of priest and king (v. <a ref='Zechariah 6:13'>13</a> ). This appendix supplements visions 4 and 5 ( <a ref='Zechariah 3:1–10'>3:1–10</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 4:1–14'>4:1–14</a> ) and culminates the series of 8 visions with the climax of history—the coronation of the Lord Jesus Christ. <a ref='Zechariah 6:10'>6:10</a> offering <b>from the exiles.</b> Jewish exiles who remained in Babylon, but who had come bearing gifts for the building of the temple are identified. Zechariah was told to meet them that same day and receive their gifts. <a ref='Zechariah 6:11'>6:11</a> <b>an</b> ornate <b>crown.</b> Zechariah was to make not a High Priest’s crown or turban, but an ornate crown, one constructed of many circlets, a majestic crown (like the one on the returning Messiah in <a ref='Revelation 19:12'>Rev 19:12</a> ). This crown was to be set on the head of the High Priest, Joshua. In the OT, the kingly and priestly offices were kept rigidly distinct. The office of king belonged only to the house of David, while the office of priest was only for the house of Levi. Uzziah’s mingling of the two brought about his death (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 26:16–23'>2Chr 26:16–23</a> ). But here this act is ordered by God to depict the coming King/Priest Messiah. <a ref='Zechariah 6:12'>6:12</a> <b>name is Branch.</b> Though the crown was placed on the head of Joshua, the High Priest (v. <a ref='Zechariah 6:11'>11</a> ), the act was a symbol of that future crowning of Messiah, the Branch (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 3:8'>3:8</a> ). In Messiah, the offices of king and priest will be united. <a ref='Zechariah 6:12–15'>6:12–15</a> In this brief section, 8 facts are given about Messiah, the Branch: 1) He will come from Israel (v. <a ref='Zechariah 6:12'>12</a> ); 2) He will build the millennial temple (vv. <a ref='Zechariah 6:12–13'>12b–13a</a> ); 3) He will be glorious (v. <a ref='Zechariah 6:13'>13</a> ); 4) He will be king and priest (v. <a ref='Zechariah 6:13'>13</a> ); 5) He makes peace (v. <a ref='Zechariah 6:13'>13</a> ); 6) He opens the kingdom to Gentiles (v. <a ref='Zechariah 6:15'>15a</a> ); 7) He will corroborate God’s Word (v. <a ref='Zechariah 6:15'>15b</a> ); and 8) He demands obedience (v. <a ref='Zechariah 6:15'>15c</a> ). This, as always, is the essential matter. After Israel believes, the Messiah will come to set up His kingdom (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–13:1'>12:10—13:1</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:9–21'>14:9–21</a> ). Faith and cleansing must come first. <a ref='Zechariah 6:12–13'>6:12–13</a> <b>He will build the temple.</b> The building of the restoration temple was promised to Zerubbabel (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 4:9–10'>4:9–10</a> ). The building of this temple, promised to Messiah, points to the construction of the millennial temple (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 2:2–4'>Is 2:2–4</a> ; <a ref='Eze 40-43'>Eze 40–43</a> ; <a ref='Haggai 2:6–9'>Hag 2:6–9</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 6:14'>6:14</a> The crown was not to be kept by Joshua, but was to serve as both a memorial to the devotion of the men who came from Babylon and, more importantly, as a reminder of the coming of Messiah and the ultimate hope of Israel. <b>Helem … Hen.</b> Helem is apparently another name of Heldai, and Hen another name for Josiah the son of Zephaniah (see v. <a ref='Zechariah 6:10'>10</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 7:1–8:23'>7:1—8:23</a> As a result of the night visions which described the future of Israel, including the subjugation of her enemies, the final regathering to the Land, her cleansing, restoration, and the coming of Messiah and His kingdom, the Jews were greatly encouraged and comforted. The temple was more than half done, all obstacles to the construction were removed by the decree of Darius confirming the decree of Cyrus (cf. <a ref='Ezra 6:1–14'>Ezr 6:1–14</a> ), and all was going very well. This gave rise to a question by the delegation from Bethel. The question involved the continuation of a national fast to mourn the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple. Though Jerusalem had no walls yet and there were many ruins (cf. <a ref='Haggai 1:4'>Hag 1:4</a> ), now that the temple was being finished, they were sent to inquire of Yahweh and the priests whether they needed to continue the fast. The question is answered negatively in chap. <a ref='Zec 7'>7</a> with two messages and positively in chap. <a ref='Zec 8'>8</a> with two messages. Each of the 4 messages was given to impress upon the people the need to live righteously. As with chaps. <a ref='Zec 1-6'>1–6</a> , the prophet began historically and then moved prophetically to the time of the Second Advent of Christ. <a ref='Zechariah 7:1'>7:1</a> <b>the fourth year of King Darius.</b> Nov./Dec. 518 BC, two years after Zechariah’s first message (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 1:1'>1:1</a> ) and the night visions (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 1:7'>1:7</a> ), and two years before the temple was completed. <a ref='Zechariah 7:2'>7:2</a> <b>Bethel.</b> The town of Bethel was 12 mi. north of Jerusalem. Since the return from Babylon, the Jews had rebuilt and reinhabited Bethel (cf. <a ref='Ezra 2:28'>Ezr 2:28</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 7:32'>Ne 7:32</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 7:3'>7:3</a> <b>weep in the fifth month and abstain.</b> The Day of Atonement was the only annual fast required by God’s law ( <a ref='Leviticus 23:27'>Lv 23:27</a> ), and other occasional fasts were called for by God (cf. <a ref='Joel 1:12'>Joel 1:12</a> , <a ref='Joel 1:14'>14</a> ). The fall of Jerusalem was remembered by 4 fasts (cf. <a ref='2Ki 25'>2Ki 25</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 39:1–4'>Jer 39:1–4</a> ; <a ref='Je 41'>41</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 52:13'>52:13</a> ), in the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months ( <i>see note on <a ref='Zechariah 8:19'>8:19</a></i> ). Because the temple was burned in the fifth month (July–Aug.), that fast was considered the most serious, and thus the delegation uses it as the test case (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 25:8'>2Ki 25:8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 52:12'>Jer 52:12</a> ). They had kept this wailing and fasting for “many years,” but it seemed only a wearisome ritual in light of the present prosperity. <a ref='Zechariah 7:5'>7:5</a> <b>seventh months.</b> This fast mourned the death of Gedaliah, the governor appointed by Nebuchadnezzar ( <a ref='2 Kings 25:22–26'>2Ki 25:22–26</a> ; <a ref='Je 41'>Jer 41</a> ) after the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC. <a ref='Zechariah 7:5–6'>7:5–6</a> <b>was it actually for Me that you fasted?</b> Zechariah pointed out that they were not fasting out of genuine sorrow and repentance, but out of self-pity (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 1:10–15'>Is 1:10–15</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 58:3–9'>58:3–9</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 7:7'>7:7</a> <b>words … Yahweh called out.</b> The important matter is not ritual, but obedience. It is obedience to God’s Word that brought in the past great joy, peace, and prosperity to Israel, and that covered the land during the time of David and Solomon. If the present generation in Zechariah’s time substitutes ritual for obedience, they too will lose the joy, peace, and prosperity they were enjoying. <b>Negev … Shephelah.</b> A reference to the area south of Beersheba and the Mediterranean coastal plain, encompassing the land from south to west. <a ref='Zechariah 7:8–14'>7:8–14</a> This is the second of the 4 messages in answer to the question (v. <a ref='Zechariah 7:3'>3</a> ). Harkening back to his opening call ( <a ref='Zechariah 1:4'>1:4</a> ) and to the warnings of earlier prophets (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 1:11–17'>Is 1:11–17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 58:1–7'>58:1–7</a> ; <a ref='Amos 5:10–15'>Am 5:10–15</a> ), the prophet alerts the delegation to produce the fruits of righteousness that demonstrate obedience to God’s Word (vv. <a ref='Zechariah 7:9–10'>9–10</a> ) and to revisit the actions of their fathers who deliberately rejected God’s Word (vv. <a ref='Zechariah 7:11–12'>11–12a</a> ) which activated the fury of God against them (v. <a ref='Zechariah 7:12'>12b</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:15–68'>Dt 28:15–68</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:14–16'>2Chr 36:14–16</a> . <a ref='Zechariah 7:12'>7:12</a> <b>by His Spirit.</b> The Holy Spirit served a vital function in the revelation and inspiration of God’s Word through human authors (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:10'>1Co 2:10</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 1:21'>2Pe 1:21</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 7:13'>7:13</a> <b>I would not listen.</b> This reflects a severe form of God’s wrath by which He abandons disobedient sinners. <i>See note on <a ref='Zechariah 11:9'>11:9</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Judges 10:13–14'>Jdg 10:13–14</a> ; <a ref='Judges 16:18–21'>16:18–21</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 1:24–31'>Pr 1:24–31</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 4:17'>Hos 4:17</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 15:14'>Mt 15:14</a> ; <a ref='Romans 1:18–32'>Ro 1:18–32</a> . <a ref='Zechariah 7:14'>7:14</a> <b>I scattered them.</b> This refers to the captivity and dispersion of the people and the desolation of the land in their absence (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:3–10'>Dt 30:3–10</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 8:1–23'>8:1–23</a> Continuing his response to the delegation from Bethel, Zechariah contrasted Israel’s past judgment with the promised future restoration. In light of past captivity, the nation was to repent and live righteously; in light of promised future blessings, Israel is to repent and live righteously. The last two messages (vv. <a ref='Zechariah 8:1–17'>1–17</a> and <a ref='Zechariah 8:18–23'>18–23</a> ) look positively to the future, when Israel will be brought to a place of special blessing and fasts will become feasts. <a ref='Zechariah 8:2'>8:2</a> <b>jealous.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Zechariah 1:14'>1:14</a> .</i> This very strong language expresses the idea that God can’t bear the estrangement from His chosen people brought about by their sin, nor can He always tolerate the enemies of Israel. His love for Israel is so great that He will come in full presence to Israel again and dwell with His people. Ezekiel had the vision of God leaving Jerusalem ( <a ref='Eze 8-11'>Eze 8–11</a> ) and of His presence returning ( <a ref='Ezekiel 43:1–5'>43:1–5</a> ). <b>Zion.</b> The mountain on which ancient Jerusalem was built, which became a name for the city. <a ref='Zechariah 8:3'>8:3</a> <b>City of Truth.</b> A city which is characterized by truth, both in word and in deed (vv. <a ref='Zechariah 8:8'>8</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 8:16'>16</a> ) because it is ruled over by Messiah who is characterized by truth ( <a ref='John 14:6'>Jn 14:6</a> ). <b>the Holy Mountain.</b> Zion is holy because the King who lives there is holy ( <a ref='Isaiah 6:3'>Is 6:3</a> ).

But, since they had begun again to build the temple, God would not treat the people as He had those described in v. <a ref='Zechariah 8:10'>10</a> . <a ref='Zechariah 8:12–13'>8:12–13</a> The richness and comprehensiveness of these promises of prosperity look beyond the historical moment to the time when Messiah reigns in His millennial kingdom.

Such obedience can only be brought about by the power of the Spirit in the life of one who has been transformed by God’s grace through faith. These standards are reminiscent of <a ref='Psalms 15:1–5'>Pss 15:1–5</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 24:4'>24:4</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 6:20–22'>Pr 6:20–22</a> . <a ref='Zechariah 8:18–19'>8:18–19</a> The fourth and final response to the delegation from Bethel notes how national days of fasting and mourning will be transformed into joyous feasts. This was really the answer to the original question in <a ref='Zechariah 7:3'>7:3</a> . Turn the fasts into feasts of joy in light of the promised blessings of God. <a ref='Zechariah 8:19'>8:19</a> In addition to the fasts of the fifth and seventh months ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Zechariah 7:3'>7:3</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 7:5'>5</a></i> ), two additional fasts were held. In the fourth month they commemorated the breaching of the wall of Jerusalem ( <a ref='2 Kings 25:3'>2Ki 25:3</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 39:2–4'>Jer 39:2–4</a> ) and in the tenth month they remembered the beginning of the final siege of Jerusalem which began in 588 BC ( <a ref='2 Kings 25:1'>2Ki 25:1</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 39:1'>Jer 39:1</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 8:20–22'>8:20–22</a> Israel restored in millennial glory will be the means of blessing to all the world (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 2:2–4'>Is 2:2–4</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:1–5'>Mic 4:1–5</a> ). Gentiles from around the world will make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to entreat Yahweh. This signifies salvation of people from all over the world during the kingdom, fulfilling <a ref='Ps 122'>Ps 122</a> . <a ref='Zechariah 8:23'>8:23</a> <b>In those days.</b> In the days in which the messianic kingdom on earth is inaugurated ( <i>see note on <a ref='Joel 3:18'>Joel 3:18</a></i> ), the Jews will truly be God’s messengers as originally intended, and will bring multitudes to Christ. The 10 to 1 ratio represents a vast number of Gentiles who will come (cf. <a ref='Genesis 31:7'>Ge 31:7</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 26:26'>Lv 26:26</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 14:22'>Nu 14:22</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 1:8'>1Sa 1:8</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 4:12'>Ne 4:12</a> ). The Messiah, in the midst of millennial Israel, will be the attraction of the world. People, seeing the Jews so blessed in their kingdom, will demand to go and meet the Savior King. <a ref='Zechariah 9:1–14:21'>9:1—14:21</a> Employing the phrase “in that day,” Zechariah places primary focus in his final two undated oracles on: 1) the downfall of the nation; 2) the salvation of Israel; and 3) the establishment of the Messiah as King. The first oracle ( <a ref='Zechariah 9:1–11:17'>9:1—11:17</a> ) deals with the first and third features and ends with prophecies of the rejection of Christ at His first coming; the second oracle ( <a ref='Zechariah 12:1–14:21'>12:1—14:21</a> ) deals with the second and third culminating with the kingdom of Messiah Christ. <a ref='Zechariah 9:1–8'>9:1–8</a> This oracle features a series of judgments announced against the nations surrounding Israel (vv. <a ref='Zechariah 9:1–7'>1–7</a> ), with deliverance promised for His people (v. <a ref='Zechariah 9:8'>8</a> ). Most understand this to be a prophecy of the famous Greek conqueror, Alexander the Great’s victories, given approximately 200 years before he marched through Israel. He provides an analogy of Christ returning to judge the nations and save Israel at the end of the Great Tribulation (cf. <a ref='Matthew 24:21'>Mt 24:21</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 9:1'>9:1</a> <b>oracle.</b> A heavy, burdensome message, the prediction of a threatening event, in this case the judgment of the nations. <b>Hadrach.</b> The location is uncertain. Possibly it is ancient Hatarika, a city mentioned in the annals of Assyrian Kings, in the vicinity of Hamath. The old Jewish tradition made it a compound name, <i>Had</i> meaning sharp and <i>rach</i> meaning soft. The sharp/soft land could be a reference to the dual Medo-Persian kingdom. Media was thought to be the sharp side because of its powerful conquerors like Cyrus, and Persia the soft side because of its debauchery. The cities in vv. <a ref='Zechariah 9:1–2'>1–2</a> were major cities under Medo-Persian power. <b>Damascus.</b> This city was to be the main target of the judgment of God through Alexander upon the capital of Syria, one of Israel’s worst enemies from ca. 900–722 BC. <b>the eyes of men … are toward Yahweh.</b> God’s judgment through Alexander the Great would be visible to all mankind, especially Israel. <a ref='Zechariah 9:2'>9:2</a> <b>Hamath.</b> A major city, 125 mi. north of Damascus on the Orontes River. Alexander conquered these cities of the Syrian interior under Medo-Persian control, then turned to the coast moving south, conquering the cities of the Phoenicians and Philistines on the way to Egypt. <b>Tyre and Sidon … are very wise.</b> These Phoenician cities on the Mediterranean coast were known for their skill and wisdom (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 28:12–15'>Eze 28:12–15</a> ) and Satanic influence ( <a ref='Ezekiel 28:11–19'>Eze 28:11–19</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 9:3–4'>9:3–4</a> <b>Tyre.</b> This city was occupying an island one-half mile offshore, and thought itself to be invincible (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 23:1–4'>Is 23:1–4</a> ). With walls 150 ft. high in some places, it was such an impregnable city that the Assyrian Shalmaneser besieged it for 5 years and failed to conquer it. Nebuchadnezzar tried for 13 years unsuccessfully. But Alexander, God’s judgment instrument, using the rubble of the mainland city destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, built a causeway out to the island and destroyed it in 7 months (ca. 334–332 BC). <a ref='Zechariah 9:5–6'>9:5–6</a> The cities of Philistia were terrified at the swiftness with which Alexander the Great’s army was able to conquer Tyre. Then, Alexander marched south, conquering all these Philistine cities and killing their national pride. <a ref='Zechariah 9:7'>9:7</a> This judgment put an end to idolatry for many Philistines who turned to the God of Israel. In the imagery of this verse, the nation is seen as a man with blood in his mouth (from eating sacrifices to idols) and abominations (the other defiled food of idol worship) which are removed. The picture is of conversion to worship the true God. <b>like a Jebusite.</b> These ancient inhabitants of Jerusalem were conquered by David (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 5:6–11'>2Sa 5:6–11</a> ) and amalgamated into Israel. So it will be with these Philistines. <a ref='Zechariah 9:8'>9:8</a> This is the pledge of God’s protection of Jerusalem from Alexander. It came true when, on his way south, Alexander treated Jerusalem with kindness. After having subjugated Egypt, he returned through Israel again without doing Israel harm. <b>no taskmaster will pass over them anymore.</b> The supernatural and lasting protection here promised must anticipate the Second Advent of Messiah, whose coming is the subject through the rest of this message. The transition from Alexander to Christ can be understood in this way: if God can use a pagan king to judge the nations and save Israel, how much more will He use His righteous Messiah? So v. <a ref='Zechariah 9:8'>8</a> bridges to the final judgment and deliverance of Messiah. <a ref='Zechariah 9:9–10'>9:9–10</a> The two advents of Christ are here compressed as though they were one as in <a ref='Isaiah 61:1–3'>Is 61:1–3</a> (cf. <a ref='Luke 4:16'>Lk 4:16</a> , <a ref='Luke 4:21'>21</a> ). Actually, v. <a ref='Zechariah 9:9'>9</a> refers to His first coming and v. <a ref='Zechariah 9:10'>10</a> is His second. OT prophets didn’t see the great time period between the two comings. The church age was a “mystery” hidden from them (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 3:1–9'>Eph 3:1–9</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:27'>Col 1:27</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 9:9'>9:9</a> <b>king … mounted on a donkey.</b> Unlike Alexander the Great, this King comes riding on a donkey (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:25'>Jer 17:25</a> ). This was fulfilled at Christ’s triumphal entry ( <a ref='Matthew 21:1–5'>Mt 21:1–5</a> ; <a ref='John 12:12–16'>Jn 12:12–16</a> ). The Jews should have been looking for someone from the line of David (cf. <a ref='2Sa 7'>2Sa 7</a> ; <a ref='1Ch 17'>1Chr 17</a> ). Four elements in this verse describe Messiah’s character: 1) He is King; 2) He is just; 3) He brings salvation; and 4) He is humble. <a ref='Zechariah 9:10–15'>9:10–15</a> Zechariah moves to the Second Advent of Christ and the establishment of His universal kingdom ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Zechariah 9:9–10'>9:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 11:15–16'>11:15–16</a></i> ). Not characterized by bloodshed, Messiah’s rule will be a kingdom of peace in which weapons of warfare will be destroyed or converted to peaceful uses (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 2:4'>Is 2:4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 9:5–7'>9:5–7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:1–10'>11:1–10</a> ; <a ref='Micah 5:2'>Mic 5:2</a> , <a ref='Micah 5:10–15'>10–15</a> ), and peace spreads from the Euphrates River (the terminus of civilization) to the world. <a ref='Zechariah 9:10'>9:10</a> <b>Ephraim.</b> This is another name for Israel, used often in the OT for the northern kingdom and occasionally for the whole nation. <a ref='Zechariah 9:11'>9:11</a> <b>blood of your covenant.</b> Why is Israel to be so blessed? It is not because of her faithfulness through the centuries, but because of God’s unfailing devotion to His covenant of blood made with Abraham ( <a ref='Genesis 15:1–10'>Ge 15:1–10</a> ), which is in force as long as God lives. <b>from the waterless pit.</b> Prisoners in ancient times were often kept in dry wells or pits, as Joseph was ( <a ref='Genesis 37:24'>Ge 37:24</a> , <a ref='Genesis 37:28'>28</a> ). The exiles of Israel, pictured as being in a dry well of captivity, suffering, and despair, will be freed because of His unbreakable covenant with them. They are thus called “prisoners who have the hope” (v. <a ref='Zechariah 9:12'>12</a> ) who are to receive “double” blessing (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 61:7'>Is 61:7</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 9:13–15'>9:13–15</a> Reminiscent of the Exodus ( <a ref='Exodus 19:16–19'>Ex 19:16–19</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 3:3–15'>Hab 3:3–15</a> ), Yahweh will protect and empower them (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:11–16'>Is 11:11–16</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 12:6'>Zec 12:6</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 12:8'>8</a> ). The initial historical fulfillment of this prophecy came when the Maccabees defeated the Greeks ca. 167 BC; the final, complete fulfillment will occur at His Second Advent. The Maccabean triumph is only a pledge and a preview of final triumph over all enemies. <a ref='Zechariah 9:15'>9:15</a> <b>trample on … stones of a sling.</b> This may mean the Jews will easily subdue their enemies as David did Goliath ( <a ref='1Sa 17'>1Sa 17</a> ). Or better, it could mean they will contemptuously tread on the harmless missiles cast at them by their enemies. This could depict the futility of Armageddon when the armies of the God-hating world gather in Israel and are destroyed by the Messiah (cf. <a ref='Revelation 16:12–16'>Rev 16:12–16</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:11–16'>19:11–16</a> ). The bloodshed of the godless will be visible in that day, from one end of the land to the other, like blood splattered on the corners of the altar of sacrifice from basins which caught it when the animal was slain (cf. <a ref='Revelation 14:20'>Rev 14:20</a> ). <b>drink … roar.</b> This describes Israel’s excitement and exuberance over their victory. <a ref='Zechariah 9:16–17'>9:16–17</a> Abundant prosperity, such as the world has never seen, results in excessive rejoicing, and praise results from God “saving” His people, Israel (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:28'>Dt 33:28</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 4:7–8'>Ps 4:7–8</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 10:1'>10:1</a> <b>Ask rain from Yahweh.</b> In light of the promised blessings of <a ref='Zechariah 9:17'>9:17</a> , the prophet encourages the people to request these blessings from Yahweh, with confidence. There will be literal rain and spring rain (Apr./May) in the kingdom (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 35:1–7'>Is 35:1–7</a> ) making the land flourish, but the promise here extends to refer to spiritual blessings (cf. <a ref='Hosea 6:1–3'>Hos 6:1–3</a> ). The “late rain” of spiritual grace and goodness from God will bring refreshment to people’s souls (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 44:3'>Is 44:3</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 10:2'>10:2</a> <b>teraphim … diviners.</b> In contrast to God who provides abundance, idols or household gods (cf. <a ref='Genesis 31:19'>Ge 31:19</a> , <a ref='Genesis 31:34'>34</a> ) and demonic fortunetellers left Israel as sheep without a shepherd (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 34:6–10'>Eze 34:6–10</a> ). God will judge them all for that false leadership (v. <a ref='Zechariah 10:3'>3</a> ). The implication of these words is that a similar deception will occur in the end times. The NT confirms this (cf. <a ref='Matthew 24:5'>Mt 24:5</a> , <a ref='Matthew 24:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Matthew 24:22–28'>22–28</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:8–12'>2Th 1:8–12</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 10:3'>10:3</a> <b>splendid horse.</b> Though like sheep, Israel will become like an invincible majestic warhorse when strengthened by Yahweh to conquer His foes ( <a ref='Zechariah 12:8'>12:8</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 10:4'>10:4</a> <b>cornerstone.</b> A frequently used messianic title (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 28:16'>Is 28:16</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:20'>Eph 2:20</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:6–8'>1Pe 2:6–8</a> ). Christ is the foundation on which His kingdom rests. <b>tent peg.</b> This may refer to a peg attached to the tent’s center pole on which utensils and valuables were hung. Messiah is the peg in the midst of His kingdom, for all the glory of the kingdom will hang on Him (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 6:13'>6:13</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 22:23–24'>Is 22:23–24</a> ). <b>bow of battle …</b> good <b>taskmaster.</b> Another reference to the Messiah (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 9:13'>9:13</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:11–16'>Rev 19:11–16</a> ), under whose authority every ruler will be sanctioned. <a ref='Zechariah 10:5'>10:5</a> <b>Yahweh</b> will be <b>with them.</b> The prophet pictured foot soldiers overpowering the cavalry (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 12:1–9'>12:1–9</a> ) in battle. This analogy was to illustrate the power of God’s people when He is “with them.” <a ref='Zechariah 10:6'>10:6</a> <b>house of Judah … Joseph.</b> Both the southern and northern kingdoms of Israel will be restored to a position of blessing, as the whole nation is restored in millennial blessing (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:37'>Jer 32:37</a> ). <b>I am Yahweh their God.</b> The reason for Israel’s restoration was because of God, the covenant keeper, who gave a strong reiteration of His continuing, unconditional commitment to them. The curses of <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:15–68'>Dt 28:15–68</a> expressed in the Assyrian and Babylonian deportations did not abrogate God’s promised blessings to Israel or transfer them to another people. Even after they had crucified the Messiah, Peter told them they were still able to receive the promise (cf. <a ref='Acts 2:39'>Ac 2:39</a> ) because the Abrahamic Covenant was still in place and they were the people of God’s promise ( <a ref='Acts 3:25'>Ac 3:25</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 10:7'>10:7</a> The joy of the restored nation of Israel at the beginning of the Millennium is likened to those who have been drinking wine (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 66:10–14'>Is 66:10–14</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 3:14–20'>Zep 3:14–20</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 10:8'>10:8</a> <b>I will whistle for them.</b> The prophecy summarized what had been said, namely the Messiah’s call for Israel to be redeemed and for them to regather in His land (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 5:26'>Is 5:26</a> ). As in Egypt (cf. <a ref='Exodus 1:8–22'>Ex 1:8–22</a> ), those of Israel who are protected by God because of their faith in Messiah will survive the Tribulation and enter the Millennium to multiply greatly (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 2:4'>2:4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 54:1–3'>Is 54:1–3</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 10:9–10'>10:9–10</a> Another summary is given stating that, as God had previously scattered them all over the world (AD 70), He would bring them back to populate His messianic kingdom (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:11–12'>Is 11:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 49:20–22'>49:20–22</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 10:11'>10:11</a> Similar to Israel crossing the Red Sea, God will remove both geographical and political obstacles to Israel’s return for the Kingdom of Messiah. Assyria and Egypt, traditional enemies of Israel, symbolize any nation that would try to withstand God from fulfilling His will (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:11–12'>Is 11:11–12</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 10:12'>10:12</a> <b>in His name they will walk.</b> The people of Israel will be the messengers of their Messiah in the millennial kingdom. This is the complete spiritual restoration spoken of by Ezekiel (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:21–38'>Eze 36:21–38</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 37:1–14'>37:1–14</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 37:22–28'>22–28</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 11:1–17'>11:1–17</a> In stark contrast to chaps. <a ref='Zec 9-10'>9–10</a> , in which Messiah is pictured as a wonderful Shepherd, this passage presents an ugly picture of the rejection of the Messiah, the true Shepherd. The prophet turns from the glories of the accepted Messiah at His second coming to the national apostasy and rejection of Messiah at His first coming. <a ref='Zechariah 11:1–3'>11:1–3</a> As a fire sweeping down to ravage the whole land of Israel, Zechariah described a fire of judgment that would consume the ungodly as a conflagration consumes trees. The devastation is not limited to spiritual judgment only, but includes the death of people as the land of Israel is judged. The language is the book’s most poetic. “Lebanon,” “Bashan,” and “Jordan” represent the whole land as judgment sweeps from top to bottom covering the entire nation from the north, inland, and down the Jordan Valley to the southern border. <a ref='Zechariah 11:2'>11:2</a> <b>Wail, O cypress.</b> If the mighty cedars have fallen, surely the more vulnerable smaller trees will be unable to stand. <b>oaks of Bashan.</b> The poem moves from Lebanon, on the northern border of Israel, to Bashan, east of the Sea of Galilee, known for its oaks and lush pastures (cf. <a ref='Amos 4:1'>Am 4:1</a> ; <a ref='Micah 7:14'>Mic 7:14</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 11:3'>11:3</a> <b>shepherds’ wail.</b> The shepherds lament the loss of their pastures, and the young lions their homes and food. Both are poetic figures of the misery that will occur in the land under the ravaging judgment. As the chapter unfolds, it becomes clear that this most likely prophesies the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 and the subsequent devastation of the whole land, which resulted in the dissolution of the Jewish state. <a ref='Zechariah 11:4–14'>11:4–14</a> The cause for the calamity of vv. <a ref='Zechariah 11:1–3'>1–3</a> is here given: the rejection of the true Shepherd. God used the prophet Zechariah as an actor playing the part of a shepherd to illustrate the true Shepherd, Jesus Christ, and the rejection He encountered. Instructions given in vv. <a ref='Zechariah 11:4–6'>4–6</a> are enacted in vv. <a ref='Zechariah 11:7–14'>7–14</a> . <a ref='Zechariah 11:4–6'>11:4–6</a> The Lord God said that His people were to be treated like sheep fattened for the slaughter, whose shepherds have no pity, but are only interested in money for the meat. Thus God will serve up His sheep for slaughter without pity. With God’s pity (cf. <a ref='Hosea 1:6'>Hos 1:6</a> ) and protection withdrawn, they will be given over to their Roman “neighbors” and to their “King” Caesar (cf. <a ref='John 19:14–15'>Jn 19:14–15</a> ), who will ultimately lead them to their destruction in AD 70 by the Roman army (cf. <a ref='John 11:47–50'>Jn 11:47–50</a> ). Over one million Jews were slaughtered in that assault, and almost half a million in subsequent Roman attacks in Israel. <a ref='Zechariah 11:7–14'>11:7–14</a> Here is the record of Zechariah playing a dramatic role to act out the rejection of Christ that will lead to the judgment of Israel outlined in vv. <a ref='Zechariah 11:1–3'>1–3</a> . <a ref='Zechariah 11:7'>11:7</a> <b>I shepherded the flock.</b> The prophet did feed the truth of God to his people as a picture of what Messiah would do when He came. <b>the afflicted of the flock.</b> Only the poor responded when Jesus came to feed the flock (cf. <a ref='Matthew 11:5'>Mt 11:5</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:26'>1Co 1:26</a> ). They were the lowly who would not follow the pride of the priest, scribes, and Pharisees, but believed on Jesus. <b>Favor … Union.</b> The prophet’s symbolic act called for him to take “two staffs.” Eastern shepherds often carried two sticks, a rod to ward off wild beasts and a staff to guide and retrieve wayward sheep (cf. <a ref='Psalms 23:4'>Ps 23:4</a> ). The staff speaks of Christ the Good Shepherd who expressed the love and grace of God by tenderly leading and protecting His people ( <a ref='Mark 6:34'>Mk 6:34</a> ), while the rod speaks of His unifying ministry, binding together the scattered house of Israel into one fold (cf. v. <a ref='Zechariah 11:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 15:24'>Mt 15:24</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 11:8'>11:8</a> <b>annihilated the three shepherds.</b> Though difficult to identify, one of the oldest interpretations is that this refers to the priests, elders, and scribes of Israel (see Introduction: Interpretive Challenges ). Jesus bestowed grace and unity upon the populace, but confronted the hypocrisy of these religious leaders, and because they rejected Him all 3 offices were obliterated in a short time. God ended the traditional offices of the mediators and in their place brought a new priesthood of believers (cf. <a ref='1 Peter 2:5'>1Pe 2:5</a> , <a ref='1 Peter 2:9'>9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 1:6'>Rev 1:6</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 5:10'>5:10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:6'>20:6</a> ). <b>my soul was impatient with them.</b> Lit. it means “My soul was short with them,” referring to the limits of God’s patience toward the unrepentant. <a ref='Zechariah 11:9'>11:9</a> <b>one another’s flesh.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Zechariah 7:13'>7:13</a> .</i> In this drama, Zechariah played the unnatural role of a shepherd who abandons his sheep and stops teaching and protecting them. Those who refused to believe were to be given over to pursue their own desires and left exposed to deadly enemies. In the Roman siege of AD 70, some of the starving inhabitants did resort to cannibalism (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 19:9'>Jer 19:9</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 11:10'>11:10</a> <b>break my covenant.</b> Apparently, this refers to God’s promise to restrain the nations from decimating Israel if she would consistently obey ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:1–14'>Dt 28:1–14</a> ). God set aside His kind and gracious protection and His providential care for His people, allowing Rome to invade and destroy Israel (cf. <a ref='Luke 19:41–44'>Lk 19:41–44</a> ; <a ref='Luke 21:24'>21:24</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 11:11'>11:11</a> The believing remnant of Christ’s day knew God’s Word was being fulfilled. They knew judgment was coming, but avoided the long-term consequences by faith in Christ. <a ref='Zechariah 11:12'>11:12</a> <b>thirty</b> shekels <b>of silver.</b> Zechariah carried on the drama by symbolically picturing Jesus asking those He came to shepherd what they felt He was worth to them. In a mocking response, the leaders offered 30 silver pieces, which was the amount of compensation paid for a slave gored by an ox (cf. <a ref='Exodus 21:32'>Ex 21:32</a> ). This is exactly what Judas Iscariot was paid to betray the Great Shepherd ( <a ref='Matthew 26:14–16'>Mt 26:14–16</a> ). The Jews of Jesus’ day who offered that amount were saying He was worth no more than a common slave. <a ref='Zechariah 11:13'>11:13</a> The prophet received further instruction in acting out the drama that pictures the rejection of Christ, namely to throw the 30 pieces into the temple. This was fulfilled when Judas Iscariot, laden with guilt, went back and threw the blood money on the temple floor. The priests gathered the money and used it to buy a field from a potter (cf. <a ref='Matthew 27:3–10'>Mt 27:3–10</a> ). <b>valuable price.</b> This ultimate sarcasm from God greeted the ultimate insult from humanity. <a ref='Zechariah 11:14'>11:14</a> The breaking of the first staff (v. <a ref='Zechariah 11:10'>10</a> ) preceded the Jews’ rejection of the Shepherd, while the breaking of this rod once symbolizing the nation’s unity (v. <a ref='Zechariah 11:7'>7</a> ) followed His rejection, being fulfilled in the Roman breakup of the Jewish commonwealth. Josephus recorded that in the Roman conquering, the internal dissension among the people in their conflicting parties set Jew against Jew so that they struck each other as cruelly as the Romans struck them. <a ref='Zechariah 11:15–16'>11:15–16</a> With the removal of the true Shepherd, the drama called for the prophet to play a foolish shepherd, who depicted the Antichrist of Daniel’s 70th week (cf. <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:3'>2Th 2:3</a> ; <a ref='John 5:43'>Jn 5:43</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>Da 9:27</a> ). Zechariah’s prophecy jumped from the first century AD to the last days before the second coming, omitting the present mystery of the church age ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Zechariah 9:9–10'>9:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 9:10–15'>9:10–15</a></i> ). This foolish (wicked) shepherd had a broken staff or club which he used to beat stubborn sheep into submission, something clearly inappropriate for a shepherd who thoughtfully and tenderly cared for his sheep. God permitted this wicked shepherd to arise, to destroy the sheep. Because they did not choose the Good Shepherd, Israel will receive a foolish one who will do absolutely the opposite of what is expected of shepherds, he will destroy the sheep (v. <a ref='Zechariah 11:16'>16</a> ). This is exactly what Antichrist does (cf. <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>Da 9:27</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:15–22'>Mt 24:15–22</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 11:17'>11:17</a> <b>his arm … right eye.</b> Zechariah condemned the worthless shepherd, noting that his strength (“arm”) and his intelligence (“eye”) would be taken away from him (cf. <a ref='Daniel 7:9–14'>Da 7:9–14</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:24–27'>24–27</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 8:23–25'>8:23–25</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:8'>2Th 2:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:20'>Rev 19:20</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:10'>20:10</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 12:1–14:21'>12:1—14:21</a> The second and final burden of Zechariah presents the familiar theme of Israel’s ultimate deliverance and salvation. In contrast to initial judgment, he now encourages God’s covenant people with a description of her restoration and blessing in the millennial kingdom, as true to His character and Zechariah’s name, “Yahweh remembers.” <a ref='Zechariah 12:1'>12:1</a> <b>oracle … concerning Israel.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Zechariah 9:1'>9:1</a> .</i> The prophecy described a future siege against the nation, indicating that there would be significant devastation before there was repentance and conversion in Israel (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 14:1–2'>14:1–2</a> ). <b>stretches … lays … forms.</b> The God who performed the work of creation will ultimately do the work of consummation. <a ref='Zechariah 12:2'>12:2</a> <b>cup that causes reeling.</b> Jerusalem is pictured as a large basin from which the nations will figuratively drink with eagerness, only to find themselves becoming intoxicated, disoriented, and thus easy prey for divine judgment at the end of Daniel’s 70th week in the battle of Armageddon when nations gather to attack Jerusalem (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 38:1–6'>Eze 38:1–6</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 38:14–16'>14–16</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 11:40–44'>Da 11:40–44</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 9:13–16'>Rev 9:13–16</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:20'>14:20</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:12–16'>16:12–16</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 12:3'>12:3</a> <b>will be severely injured.</b> Like lifting a heavy weight, Jerusalem will “seriously injure” (lit.) any people that try to gain victory over it. This is due to divine intervention (cf. vv. <a ref='Zechariah 12:4–5'>4–5</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 12:4'>12:4</a> Horses, ancient symbols of strength, emphasize God’s superior power over Israel’s enemies. Confusion, madness, and blindness are noted as curses on Israel in <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:28'>Dt 28:28</a> ; here they are promised to Israel’s enemies. <a ref='Zechariah 12:5'>12:5</a> Knowing that God had chosen Jerusalem as the city of His special affection will give confidence to the “clans” (leaders) all over the land (cf. <a ref='Psalms 46:5'>Ps 46:5</a> ). This verse has overtones indicating the saving faith of the Jews in that day, since they are claiming to have trust in God. <a ref='Zechariah 12:6'>12:6</a> Two similes describe the operation of God’s power: a “fiery laver” used to carry hot coals to start a wood fire and a “torch” used to light dry grain. Thus will the power of God devour the armies that attack Israel in the latter days. <a ref='Zechariah 12:7'>12:7</a> <b>Judah first.</b> God will first deliver the defenseless country people before the well-fortified capital, demonstrating that the battle was not won by military might or strategy. <a ref='Zechariah 12:8'>12:8</a> Yahweh will make the feeble like David, the greatest soldier in Israel’s history (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 18:7'>1Sa 18:7</a> ). And the “house of David,” like the “angel of Yahweh,” are most likely references to the Messiah Himself, who will be the strength of His people. <a ref='Zechariah 12:9'>12:9</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Zechariah 12:2'>12:2</a></i> for important cross references. <a ref='Zechariah 12:10'>12:10</a> <b>I will pour.</b> God, in His own perfect time and by His own power, will sovereignly act to save Israel. This was prophesied by other prophets (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 39:29'>Eze 39:29</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:28–32'>Joel 2:28–32</a> ), and by the apostle Paul (cf. <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ). <b>Spirit of grace and of supplication.</b> The Holy Spirit is so identified because He brings saving grace and because that grace produces sorrow that will result in repentant prayer to God for forgiveness (cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:4'>Mt 5:4</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:29'>Heb 10:29</a> ). <b>look on Me whom they have pierced.</b> Israel’s repentance will come because they look to Jesus, the One whom they rejected and crucified (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 53:5'>Is 53:5</a> ; <a ref='John 19:37'>Jn 19:37</a> ), in faith at the Second Advent ( <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ). When God says they pierced “Me,” He is certainly affirming the incarnation of deity—Jesus was God. <i>See note on <a ref='John 10:30'>Jn 10:30</a> .</i> <a ref='Zechariah 12:11'>12:11</a> <b>Hadadrimmon … Megiddo.</b> The bitter mourning of that day is likened to the death of righteous king Josiah at Hadadrimmon in the Megiddo plain (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:20–24'>2Chr 35:20–24</a> ), located northwest of Jerusalem (cf. <a ref='James 4:8–9'>Jas 4:8–9</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 12:12–14'>12:12–14</a> The royal (David and his son Nathan) and priestly (Levi and his grandson Shimei) lines, who in the past had set an evil example, were foremost in their contrition and mourning (cf. <a ref='Numbers 3:17–21'>Nu 3:17–21</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 5:14'>2Sa 5:14</a> ). It is possible that <a ref='Isaiah 53:1–9'>Is 53:1–9</a> comprises the content of their confession. This mourning and deep penitence is not some corporate emotion, but each person individually is brought to sorrow and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 11:13'>Rev 11:13</a> .</i> <a ref='Zechariah 13:1'>13:1</a> <b>house of David … inhabitants of Jerusalem.</b> The totality of cleansing is noted by its effect on both royalty and commoners. <b>a fountain … for sin and for impurity.</b> A symbolic reference to the means of cleansing and purification through the atoning death of the pierced One (cf. <a ref='1 John 1:7'>1Jn 1:7</a> ). This has direct reference to the New Covenant of <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer 31:31–34</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 36:25–32'>Eze 36:25–32</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:26–29'>Ro 11:26–29</a> . So the storm that broke upon Israel for the crime of Calvary and has raged with unmitigated fury for long, tragic centuries will suddenly end, and salvation will turn sin into righteousness in the gladness and glory of the kingdom of Messiah Jesus. <a ref='Zechariah 13:2–6'>13:2–6</a> When Christ returns and cleanses Israel from her defilement, He is also going to cleanse the nation from the deception of false prophets and their demonic religion. <a ref='Zechariah 13:2'>13:2</a> <b>unclean spirit.</b> The agents of idolatry are false prophets, but the spiritual power behind it is demonic. The wicked spirits who energize false prophets are unclean because they hate God and holiness and drive their victims into moral impurities and false religion (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:17'>Dt 32:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 22:19–23'>1Ki 22:19–23</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 106:34–39'>Ps 106:34–39</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:20'>1Co 10:20</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 13:3'>13:3</a> Because of the salvation of God which has cleansed God’s people and made them love Him and His truth, hatred of false prophecy will overrule normal human feelings, causing even a father and mother to put their own apostate child to death (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 13:6–9'>Dt 13:6–9</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 13:12–15'>12–15</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:18–22'>Dt 18:18–22</a> ). This is a stern reminder of how God feels about and will eventually treat those preachers who misrepresent the truth. <a ref='Zechariah 13:4–5'>13:4–5</a> <b>a hairy mantle.</b> Because of these stern measures, false prophets will cease wearing the traditional clothing of a prophet (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 1:8'>2Ki 1:8</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 3:4'>Mt 3:4</a> ). They will adopt a clandestine approach to propagating their demon-inspired lies (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 22:22'>Jer 22:22</a> ; <a ref='Micah 3:7'>Mic 3:7</a> ), and lie if they are asked whether they are prophets, claiming to be farmers. <a ref='Zechariah 13:6'>13:6</a> <b>wounds … between your arms.</b> The phrase cannot refer to Messiah, but is a continuation of the false prophet’s behavior in vv. <a ref='Zechariah 13:4–5'>4–5</a> . When the false prophet denies any association with pagan practices, others will challenge him to explain the suspicious wounds on his body. False prophets would cut themselves to arouse prophetic ecstasy in idolatrous rites (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 19:28'>Lv 19:28</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 14:1'>Dt 14:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 18:28'>1Ki 18:28</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 16:6'>Jer 16:6</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 48:37'>48:37</a> ), but they will claim the scars represent some attack they suffered from friends. See Introduction: Interpretive Challenges . <a ref='Zechariah 13:7–9'>13:7–9</a> Zechariah turned from the false prophets wounded in “friends’ ” houses to the true prophet wounded in the house of His friends, Israel. He compressed events of both the First ( <a ref='Zechariah 13:7'>13:7</a> ) and Second ( <a ref='Zechariah 13:8–9'>13:8–9</a> ) Advents into this brief section. It spoke of Christ’s crucifixion (v. <a ref='Zechariah 13:7'>7</a> ) and the Jewish remnant at His second coming (vv. <a ref='Zechariah 13:8–9'>8–9</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 13:7'>13:7</a> <b>My Shepherd … My Associate.</b> God spoke of the True Shepherd, that mighty Man who is His intimate associate, thus He identified Christ as His co-equal, affirming the deity of Christ (cf. <a ref='John 1:1'>Jn 1:1</a> ; <a ref='John 10:30'>10:30</a> ; <a ref='John 14:9'>14:9</a> ). <b>Strike the Shepherd.</b> In <a ref='Zechariah 11:17'>11:17</a> , it was the worthless shepherd who was to be struck; now it is the Good Shepherd (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 12:10'>12:10</a> ) whose death was designed by God from before the foundation of the world (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 53:10'>Is 53:10</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:23'>Ac 2:23</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:18–20'>1Pe 1:18–20</a> ). <b>sheep … scattered.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 26:31'>Mt 26:31</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:27'>Mk 14:27</a></i> , where Jesus applies this prophecy to the disciples who defected from Him after His arrest ( <a ref='Matthew 26:56'>Mt 26:56</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:50'>Mk 14:50</a> ), including Peter’s denial ( <a ref='Matthew 26:33–35'>Mt 26:33–35</a> , <a ref='Matthew 26:69–75'>69–75</a> ). <b>the little ones.</b> The same as the “afflicted of the flock” ( <a ref='Zechariah 11:7'>11:7</a> ). The reference is to the remnant of believers, among the Jews, who were faithful to the Messiah after His crucifixion. Turning God’s hand “against” them could mean they would suffer persecution, which they did (cf. <a ref='John 15:18'>Jn 15:18</a> , <a ref='John 15:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='John 16:2'>16:2</a> ; <a ref='James 1:1'>Jas 1:1</a> ), or it could be translated “upon” and refer to God’s protection of the faithful. <a ref='Zechariah 13:8'>13:8</a> <b>two parts … third.</b> Only a portion of the people of Israel will remain faithful to Christ and be alive in the end. The spiritual survivors will be the remnant who look upon Christ in repentance at His return (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–13:1'>12:10—13:1</a> ), which will include those who make up the 144,000 (cf. <a ref='Revelation 7:4'>Rev 7:4</a> ). These will be the sheep of the sheep-goat judgment after Christ’s return who enter the kingdom alive (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 35:10'>Is 35:10</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 30:11'>Jer 30:11</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 25:31–46'>Mt 25:31–46</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 13:9'>13:9</a> <b>they will say.</b> From the midst of their fiery refinement, the elect remnant of Israel will see Jesus Christ, their Messiah, and call on Him as their Savior and Lord. Israel will thus be saved and restored to covenant relationship with Yahweh. <a ref='Zechariah 14:1–21'>14:1–21</a> Chapter <a ref='Zec 14'>14</a> is an amplification of <a ref='Zechariah 13:8–9'>13:8–9</a> . Prior to Israel’s national conversion (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–13:1'>12:10—13:1</a> ), the Jews will make a pact with a false messiah (cf. <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>Da 9:27</a> ), known as the foolish shepherd (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 11:15–17'>11:15–17</a> ) or Antichrist. In the middle of that 7-year covenant, Antichrist will break his treaty with Israel and require the worship of him alone ( <a ref='Daniel 9:24–27'>Da 9:24–27</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:15'>Mt 24:15</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:3–4'>2Th 2:3–4</a> ). When Israel refuses, the armies of the world will gather to do battle, climaxing in a great siege of Jerusalem and the Battle of Armageddon ( <a ref='Rev 19'>Rev 19</a> ). Following Yahweh’s victory at that battle (cf. <a ref='Revelation 19:11–16'>Rev 19:11–16</a> ) will come the full restoration of Israel as anticipated in <a ref='Hosea 14:4–7'>Hos 14:4–7</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:18–21'>Joel 3:18–21</a> ; <a ref='Amos 9:13–15'>Am 9:13–15</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:1–3'>Mic 4:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 3:14–20'>Zep 3:14–20</a> . <a ref='Zechariah 14:1'>14:1</a> <b>a day is coming for Yahweh.</b> The “Day of Yahweh” is a technical term for God’s wrath unleashed against sinners. Here, Zechariah is looking at the day of Yahweh when His wrath is unleashed against the whole world of sinners, which results in the establishment of Yahweh’s millennial reign on earth. <i>See note on <a ref='Isaiah 2:12'>Is 2:12</a></i> and Introduction to Joel: Historical and Theological Themes. <b>spoil … divided among you.</b> Jerusalem will be so overcome by the enemy that the spoil will be leisurely divided in the midst of the city, illustrating how completely Jerusalem will be overthrown. This atrocity then triggers the wrath of God against the world in the day of Yahweh. <a ref='Zechariah 14:2'>14:2</a> <b>I will gather all the nations.</b> God Himself will gather the nations, using them to purge, refine, and judge (cf. <a ref='Revelation 16:13–14'>Rev 16:13–14</a> , <a ref='Revelation 16:16'>16</a> ). Their presence results in an unprecedented time of national calamity. This is the climax of “the time of Jacob’s distress” ( <a ref='Jeremiah 30:5–7'>Jer 30:5–7</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 14:3–4'>14:3–4</a> <b>His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives.</b> To prevent the eradication of His remnant, Yahweh will personally intervene to fight against the gathered nations. Just as He fought for His people in the past, so He will do in the future as the ultimate Warrior-King. Jesus will literally return to the Mt. of Olives, located east of the Kidron Valley, just as the angels announced at His ascension (cf. <a ref='Acts 1:11'>Ac 1:11</a> ). When He does, there will be a tremendous topographical upheaval (perhaps an earthquake), a phenomenon not uncommon when God announces His coming in judgment (cf. <a ref='Micah 1:2–4'>Mic 1:2–4</a> ; <a ref='Nahum 1:5'>Na 1:5</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:18–21'>Rev 16:18–21</a> ). The reaction of people is given in <a ref='Revelation 6:15–17'>Rev 6:15–17</a> . <a ref='Zechariah 14:4'>14:4</a> <b>the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle.</b> A valley running east and west will be created as the mountain is pulled northward and southward (cf. <a ref='Micah 1:2–4'>Mic 1:2–4</a> ; <a ref='Nahum 1:5'>Na 1:5</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:18–19'>Rev 16:18–19</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 14:5'>14:5</a> <b>Azel.</b> It is best understood as a place east of Jerusalem, marking the eastern end of the newly created valley. Though exact identification is unknown, it is possibly the Valley of Jehoshaphat or Valley of Decision (cf. <a ref='Joel 3:12'>Joel 3:12</a> , <a ref='Joel 3:14'>14</a> ) which will be for judgment of the nations and for the escape of the half who were not captured (v. <a ref='Zechariah 14:2'>2</a> ). <b>all the holy ones with Him.</b> This term could refer to angels, Jewish believers, or Gentile Christians together (cf. <a ref='Revelation 19:14'>Rev 19:14</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 14:6–7'>14:6–7</a> As these Jews are fleeing through this newly created valley, the lights in the world will go out (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 13:9–10'>Is 13:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 24:23'>24:23</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:10'>Joel 2:10</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:14–16'>3:14–16</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:29–30'>Mt 24:29–30</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 6:12–14'>Rev 6:12–14</a> ) and be replaced by the light of Christ’s glory (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 60:19–20'>Is 60:19–20</a> ). Only Yahweh knows the fullness of the plan for that day—when the lights go out and are lit again in the millennial kingdom (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 30:26'>Is 30:26</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 4:2'>Mal 4:2</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 14:8'>14:8</a> The highest elevation of the temple mount in Jerusalem is more than 300 ft. lower than the Mt. of Olives, but the topographical alterations described in vv. <a ref='Zechariah 14:4'>4</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 14:10'>10</a> will allow the spring to flow toward the Dead Sea (E) and the Mediterranean Sea (W) ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Ezekiel 47:1–12'>Eze 47:1–12</a></i> ). It will not dry up in summer, as most Palestinian streams do, but will flow all year, making the desert “flourish like the crocus” ( <a ref='Isaiah 35:1'>Is 35:1</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 14:9'>14:9</a> <b>Yahweh will be</b> the only <b>one … His name one.</b> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 11:15'>Rev 11:15</a> . There will be only one religion in the entire world during the millennial reign of Christ. Ruling with a rod of iron (cf. <a ref='Revelation 19:15'>Rev 19:15</a> ), Christ will have done away with all false religions spawned by Satan. This will be the ultimate fulfillment of the Abrahamic Covenant, providing a Jewish people, the nation of Israel, and the land given to Abraham; the Davidic Covenant which promised a king from the tribe of Judah and the line of David; and the New Covenant which held out the hope of spiritual redemption for Jew and Gentile. All of this will be fulfilled in and by the Lord Jesus Christ. <a ref='Zechariah 14:10'>14:10</a> <b>All the land … into a plain.</b> The term “plain” pictures the Jordan Valley, extending from Mt. Hermon (elevation 9,100 ft.) to the Gulf of Aqabah. Here the entire land, from Geba, 6 mi. to the north, to Rimmon in the south, would be leveled to become like the well-watered and fertile lowlands of the Jordan Valley (cf. <a ref='Genesis 13:10'>Ge 13:10</a> ), causing Jerusalem to be exalted above like a solitaire diamond on a ring. Jerusalem, having been rebuilt according to these dimensions, will be exalted in both place and purpose, the prominent royal city containing the temple of God and the throne of Jesus Christ (cf. <a ref='Eze 40-48'>Eze 40–48</a> ). The locations of these landmarks would be the equivalent of meaning “all Jerusalem, east to west and north to south.” <a ref='Zechariah 14:11'>14:11</a> <b>be inhabited in security.</b> Jerusalem, the city of peace, has been fought over more frequently than any other city on earth, and prayed for over the millennia ( <a ref='Psalms 122:6–9'>Ps 122:6–9</a> ). As promised by God ( <a ref='2 Samuel 7:10–17'>2Sa 7:10–17</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 2:6'>Ps 2:6</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 37:24–28'>Eze 37:24–28</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:16–17'>Joel 3:16–17</a> ), she will know permanent righteousness and with it peace, rest, and safety. <a ref='Zechariah 14:12–15'>14:12–15</a> The prophet, one final time, cycles back over the judgment that precedes the kingdom. God will strike the heathen forces gathered against Israel (vv. <a ref='Zechariah 14:1–3'>1–3</a> ) with a supernatural plague similar to His judgment of the Assyrian army ( <a ref='Isaiah 37:36'>Is 37:36</a> ), causing a panic so great that they begin to attack one another (cf. <a ref='Judges 7:22'>Jdg 7:22</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 14:15–20'>1Sa 14:15–20</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:23'>2Chr 20:23</a> ), aiding in the escape of the half (cf. vv. <a ref='Zechariah 14:2'>2</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 14:5'>5</a> ). God will enable His people to fight (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:13–14'>Is 11:13–14</a> ). Then He will send a widespread plague that even extends to their animals, preventing their use for military endeavors or escape. This depicts the thwarting of their efforts as God ultimately destroys them by the Messiah ( <a ref='Revelation 19:11–16'>Rev 19:11–16</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 14:16–19'>14:16–19</a> This very important passage reveals that some Gentiles will go into the millennial kingdom alive along with the redeemed Jews. A converted remnant from those heathen nations will make annual pilgrimages to Jerusalem to worship Yahweh and to celebrate the Feast of Booths, or Tabernacles, during the Millennium. Commemorating the time when God “tabernacled” with Israel in the wilderness, the feast represented the last of the 3 major pilgrimage festivals ( <a ref='Leviticus 23:34–36'>Lv 23:34–36</a> ), marked the final harvest of the year’s crops, and provided a time of rejoicing. In the Millennium, it will celebrate Messiah’s presence again dwelling among His people and the joyful restoration of Israel, including the ingathering of the nations. Those who refuse to go will experience drought and plague. Tragically, as the thousand years go on, there will be many people from all over the world who will reject Christ as Savior and King, joining in a final war against Him, only to be destroyed and cast into hell forever (cf. <a ref='Revelation 20:7–15'>Rev 20:7–15</a> ). <a ref='Zechariah 14:16'>14:16</a> <b>Feast of Booths.</b> The historical background can be found in <a ref='Leviticus 23:33–36'>Lv 23:33–36</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 29:12–38'>Nu 29:12–38</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:13–17'>Dt 16:13–17</a> . In addition to the Feast of Booths, or Tabernacles, two other feasts will be celebrated in the Millennium, i.e., 1) Feast of the New Year ( <a ref='Ezekiel 45:18–20'>Eze 45:18–20</a> ) and 2) Passover ( <a ref='Ezekiel 45:21–25'>Eze 45:21–25</a> ). These feasts are no more efficacious than were the feasts of the Mosaic era or the Lord’s Supper in the church age.
