Because of the lowliness (these shrubs would never exceed 8 ft. in height), commonness, fragrance (from white blossoms), and abundance in flourishing places, it is best to see these as representing Israel, God’s people. They are the lowly and yet enriched people. Their lowliness in the ravine could also refer to Israel’s current humiliation. red, sorrel, and white. Presumably these other horses had riders as well. The colors may speak of the work of the riders: red speaking of bloodshed and judgment (cf. Is 63:1–2 ), white speaking of victory (cf.

The two olive trees (vv. 3 , 11 ) represent the kingly and priestly offices in Israel through which the blessing of God was to flow. The two olive branches (v. 12 ) are the two men who occupied the supreme positions in those offices at that time: Zerubbabel, as a descendant of David, and Joshua, the High Priest, a descendant of Eleazar. Together, they foreshadow the Messiah, in whom these two offices are combined (cf. 6:13 ; Ps 110 ) and who is the true source of blessing to make Israel the light to the nations (cf. Is 60:1–3 ). They had positions of responsibility in service to “Yahweh of all the earth,” a millennial term that points to the final kingdom (cf. Mic 5:4 )."

To prevent the eradication of His remnant, Yahweh will personally intervene to fight against the gathered nations. Just as He fought for His people in the past, so He will do in the future as the ultimate Warrior-King. Jesus will literally return to the Mt. of Olives, located east of the Kidron Valley, just as the angels announced at His ascension (cf. Ac 1:11 ). When He does, there will be a tremendous topographical upheaval (perhaps an earthquake), a phenomenon not uncommon when God announces His coming in judgment (cf. Mic 1:2–4 ; Na 1:5 ; Rev 16:18–21 ). The reaction of people is given in Rev 6:15–17 ."
