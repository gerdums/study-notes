See Introduction: Author and Date . apostle of Jesus Christ. Peter was one of a unique group of men who were personally called ( Mt 10:1–4 ) and commissioned ( Jn 20:19–23 ) by Christ, and who ministered with Christ after His resurrection. See note on 5:1 . The church was built upon the foundation of their teaching ( see notes on Ac 2:42 ; Eph 2:20 ). exiles. These were strangers dispossessed in a land not their own—temporary residents or foreigners. Like all believers, they were residents of an eternal city ( Php 3:20 ; Heb 13:13–14 ). scattered. With the Greek definite article, “scattered,” or “dispersion,” is sometimes a technical term for the scattering of the Jews from Israel throughout the world ( Jn 7:35 ; Jas 1:1 ). But here, without the article, “scattered” is used in a nontechnical sense referring to spiritual pilgrims, aliens to the earth, whether Jews or Gentiles (cf. v. 17 ; 2:11 ), i.e., the church. Pontus … Bithynia. Peter’s letter is addressed to churches in provinces located in modern-day Turkey, which were part of the Roman Empire. chosen. From the Greek word which connotes the “called out ones.” The word means “to pick out” or “to select.” In the OT, it was used of Israel ( Dt 7:6 ), indicating that God sovereignly chose Israel from among all the nations of the world to believe in and belong to Him (cf. Dt 14:2 ; Pss 105:43 ; 135:4 ). Here the word is used as a term for Christians, those chosen by God for salvation (cf. Ro 8:33 ; Col 3:12 ; 2Ti 2:10 ). The word is also used for those who receive Christ during the tribulation time ( Mt 24:22 , 24 ), and holy, unfallen angels ( 1Ti 5:21 ). To be reminded that they were elected by God was a great comfort to those persecuted Christians ( see notes on Eph 1:3–14 )."

The same Greek word is translated “foreknown” in v. 20 . In both verses, the word does not refer to awareness of what is going to happen, but it clearly means a predetermined relationship in the knowledge of the Lord. God brought the salvation relationship into existence by decreeing it into existence ahead of time. Christians are foreknown for salvation in the same way Christ was foreordained before the foundation of the world to be a sacrifice for sins (cf. Ac 2:23 ). “Foreknowledge” means that God planned before, not that He observed before (cf. Ex 33:17 ; Jer 1:5 ; Am 3:2 ; Mt 7:23 ). Thus, God pre-thought and pre-determined or predestined each Christian’s salvation ( see notes on Ro 8:29 ; Eph 1:4 ). sanctifying work of the Spirit. To sanctify means “to consecrate,” “to set apart.” The objective of election is salvation, which comes to the elect through the sanctifying work of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit thus makes God’s chosen holy, by savingly setting them apart from sin and unbelief unto faith and righteousness (cf. 1Th 1:4 ; 2Th 2:13 ). Sanctification thus begins with justification (declaring the sinner just before God by graciously imputing Christ’s righteousness to him, cf. Php 3:9 ), and continues as a process of purification that goes on until glorification, when the Christian sees Jesus face-to-face. to the obedience of. Believers are set apart from sin to God in order that they might obey Jesus Christ. True salvation produces obedience to Christ (cf. Eph 2:10 ; 1Th 1:4–10 ). sprinkling of His blood. This phrase is based on Moses’ sprinkling sacrificial blood on the people of Israel as a symbol sealing their covenant as they promised to obey God’s Word ( see notes on Ex 24:4–8 ). Likewise, in the New Covenant, faith in the shedding of Christ’s blood on the cross not only activates God’s promise to give the believer perfect atonement for sin, but also brings the believer into the covenant by one’s promise of obedience to the Lord and His Word."

Though God was known as Creator and Redeemer in the OT, He was rarely called Father. Christ, however, always addressed God as His Father in the Gospels (as Jn 5:17 ), except in the separation on the cross ( Mt 27:46 ). In so doing, Christ was claiming to be of the same nature, being, or essence as the Father (cf. Mt 11:27 ; Jn 10:29–39 ; 14:6–11 ; 2Co 1:3 ; Eph 1:3 , 17 ; 2Jn 3 ). Also, by speaking of “our” Lord, Peter personalized the Christian’s intimate relationship with the God of the universe through His Son (cf. 1Co 6:17 ), an important truth for suffering Christians to remember. great mercy. The reason God provided a glorious salvation for mankind is that He is merciful. Sinners need God’s mercy because they are in a pitiful, desperate, wretched condition as sinners (cf. Eph 2:4 ; Tit 3:5 ; see also Ex 34:6 ; Ps 108:4 ; Is 27:4 ; Lam 3:22 ; Mic 7:18 ). has caused us to be born again. God gave the new birth as part of His provision in salvation. When a sinner comes to Christ and puts his faith in Him, he is born anew into God’s family and receives a new nature ( see notes on v. 23 ; Jn 1:13 ; 3:1–21 ). a living hope. The living hope is eternal life. “Hope” means confident optimism, and: 1) comes from God ( Ps 43:5 ); 2) is a gift of grace ( 2Th 2:16 ); 3) is defined by Scripture ( Ro 15:4 ); 4) is a reasonable reality ( 1Pe 3:15 ); 5) is secured by the resurrection of Jesus Christ ( Jn 11:25–26 ; 14:19 ; 1Co 15:17 ); 6) is confirmed in the Christian by the Holy Spirit ( Ro 15:13 ); 7) defends the Christian against Satan’s attacks ( 1Th 5:8 ); 8) is confirmed through trials ( Ro 5:3–4 ); 9) produces joy ( Ps 146:5 ); and 10) is fulfilled in Christ’s return ( Tit 2:13 )."

The undefiled inheritance of the Christian is in marked contrast to an earthly inheritance, all of which is corrupted and defiled. unfading. “Fading” was often used of flowers that wither and decay.

Peter teaches several important principles about trouble in this verse: 1) trouble does not last (“little while”); 2) trouble serves a purpose (“if necessary”); 3) trouble brings turmoil (“grieved”); 4) trouble comes in various forms (“trials”); and 5) trouble should not diminish the Christian’s joy (“greatly rejoice”)."

God’s dealing with Israel was somewhat of a pattern for His dealings with the believers under the New Covenant, who previously were outside God’s covenant, but have been brought under the mercy of God by faith in Christ (cf.

In other words, the Christian should voluntarily accept the potential of death as a part of the Christian life (cf. Mt 10:38–39 ; 2Co 4:8–11 ).

Instead, it should lead the believer into a watchful pursuit of holiness. Moreover, a watchful attitude creates a pilgrim mentality ( 2:11 ). It reminds the Christian that he is a citizen of heaven only sojourning on earth. It should also remind him that he will face the record of his service to God and be rewarded for what stands the test at the judgment seat of Christ, which follows the return of Christ to rapture His church (see 1Co 3:10–15 ; 4:1–5 ; 2Co 5:9–10 ). purpose of prayer.

Peter loaded this exhortation to the elders with some rich motivation. First, there was motivation by identification with Peter, who refers to himself as a fellow-elder. As such, he could give relevant exhortation to the spiritual leaders. Second, there was motivation by authority. By noting that he had been an eyewitness of Christ’s suffering, Peter was affirming his apostleship (cf. Lk 24:48 ; Ac 1:21–22 ). Third, there was the motivation by anticipation. The fact that Christian leaders will one day receive from the hand of Christ a reward for their service should be a stimulant to faithful duty.
