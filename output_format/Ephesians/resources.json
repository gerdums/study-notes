    "content": "The Letter of Paul to the Ephesians Title The letter is addressed to the church in the city of Ephesus, capital of the Roman province of Asia (Asia Minor, modern Turkey). Because the name Ephesus is not mentioned in every early manuscript, some scholars believe the letter was an encyclical, intended to be circulated and read among all the churches in Asia Minor and was simply sent first to believers in Ephesus. Author and Date There is no indication that the authorship of Paul should be in question. He is indicated as author in the opening salutation ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:1'>1:1</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 3:1'>3:1</a> ). The letter was written from prison in Rome ( <a ref='Acts 28:16–31'>Ac 28:16–31</a> ) sometime between AD 60–62 and is, therefore, often referred to as a prison epistle (along with Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon). It may have been composed almost contemporaneously with Colossians and initially sent with that epistle and Philemon by Tychicus ( <a ref='Ephesians 6:21–22'>Eph 6:21–22</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 4:7–8'>Col 4:7–8</a> ). See Introduction to Philippians: Author and Date for a discussion of the city from which Paul wrote. Background and Setting It is likely that the gospel was first brought to Ephesus by Priscilla and Aquila, an exceptionally gifted couple (see <a ref='Acts 18:26'>Ac 18:26</a> ) who were left there by Paul on his second missionary journey ( <a ref='Acts 18:18–19'>Ac 18:18–19</a> ). Located at the mouth of the Cayster River, on the east side of the Aegean Sea, the city of Ephesus was perhaps best known for its magnificent temple of Artemis, or Diana, one of the 7 wonders of the ancient world. It was also an important political, educational, and commercial center, ranking with Alexandria in Egypt, and Antioch of Pisidia, in southern Asia Minor. The fledgling church begun by Priscilla and Aquila was later firmly established by Paul on his third missionary journey ( <a ref='Ac 19'>Ac 19</a> ) and was pastored by him for some 3 years. After Paul left, Timothy pastored the congregation for perhaps a year and a half, primarily to counter the false teaching of a few influential men (such as Hymenaeus and Alexander), who were probably elders in the congregation there ( <a ref='1 Timothy 1:3'>1Ti 1:3</a> , <a ref='1 Timothy 1:20'>20</a> ). Because of those men, the church at Ephesus was plagued by “myths and endless genealogies” ( <a ref='1 Timothy 1:4'>1Ti 1:4</a> ) and by such ascetic and unscriptural ideas as the forbidding of marriage and abstaining from certain foods ( <a ref='1 Timothy 4:3'>1Ti 4:3</a> ). Although those false teachers did not rightly understand Scripture, they propounded their ungodly interpretations with confidence ( <a ref='1 Timothy 1:7'>1Ti 1:7</a> ), which produced in the church harmful “speculation rather than … the stewardship from God which is by faith” ( <a ref='1 Timothy 1:4'>1Ti 1:4</a> ). Thirty years or so later, Christ gave to the apostle John a letter for this church indicating its people had left their first love for Him ( <a ref='Revelation 2:1–7'>Rev 2:1–7</a> ). Historical and Theological Themes The first 3 chapters are theological, emphasizing NT doctrine, whereas the last 3 chapters are practical and focus on Christian behavior. Perhaps, above all, this is a letter of encouragement and admonition, written to remind believers of their immeasurable blessings in Jesus Christ; and not only to be thankful for those blessings, but also to live in a manner worthy of them. Despite, and partly even because of, a Christian’s great blessings in Jesus Christ, he is sure to be tempted by Satan to self-satisfaction and complacency. It was for that reason that, in the last chapter, Paul reminds believers of the full and sufficient spiritual armor supplied to them through God’s Word and by His Spirit ( <a ref='Ephesians 6:10–17'>6:10–17</a> ) and of their need for vigilant and persistent prayer ( <a ref='Ephesians 6:18'>6:18</a> ). A key theme of the letter is the mystery (meaning a heretofore unrevealed truth) of the church, which is “that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel” ( <a ref='Ephesians 3:6'>3:6</a> ), a truth completely hidden from the OT saints (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 3:5'>3:5</a> , <a ref='Ephesians 3:9'>9</a> ). All believers in Jesus Christ, the Messiah, are equal before the Lord as His children and as citizens of His eternal kingdom, a marvelous truth that only believers of this present age possess. Paul also speaks of the mystery of the church as the bride of Christ ( <a ref='Ephesians 5:32'>5:32</a> ; cf. <a ref='Revelation 21:9'>Rev 21:9</a> ). A major truth emphasized is that of the church as Christ’s present spiritual, earthly body, also a distinct and formerly unrevealed truth about God’s people. This metaphor depicts the church, not as an organization, but as a living organism composed of mutually related and interdependent parts. Christ is Head of the body and the Holy Spirit is its lifeblood, as it were. The body functions through the faithful use of its members’ various spiritual gifts, sovereignly and uniquely bestowed by the Holy Spirit on each believer. Other major themes include the riches and fullness of blessing to believers. Paul writes of “the riches of His [God’s] grace” ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:7'>1:7</a> ), “the unfathomable riches of Christ” ( <a ref='Ephesians 3:8'>3:8</a> ), and “the riches of His glory” ( <a ref='Ephesians 3:16'>3:16</a> ). Paul admonishes believers to “be filled up to all the fullness of God” ( <a ref='Ephesians 3:19'>3:19</a> ), to “attain to the unity of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ” ( <a ref='Ephesians 4:13'>4:13</a> ), and to “be filled with the Spirit” ( <a ref='Ephesians 5:18'>5:18</a> ). Their riches in Christ are based on His grace ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:2'>1:2</a> , <a ref='Ephesians 1:6–7'>6–7</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:7'>2:7</a> ), His peace ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:2'>1:2</a> ), His will ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:5'>1:5</a> ), His pleasure and purpose ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:9'>1:9</a> ), His glory ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:12'>1:12</a> , <a ref='Ephesians 1:14'>14</a> ), His calling and inheritance ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:18'>1:18</a> ), His power and strength ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:19'>1:19</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 6:10'>6:10</a> ), His love ( <a ref='Ephesians 2:4'>2:4</a> ), His workmanship ( <a ref='Ephesians 2:10'>2:10</a> ), His Holy Spirit ( <a ref='Ephesians 3:16'>3:16</a> ), His offering and sacrifice ( <a ref='Ephesians 5:2'>5:2</a> ), and His armor ( <a ref='Ephesians 6:11'>6:11</a> , <a ref='Ephesians 6:13'>13</a> ). The word “riches” is used 5 times in this letter; “grace” is used 12 times; “glory” 9 times; “fullness” or “filled” 6 times; and the key phrase “in Christ” (or “in Him”) some 11 times. Interpretive Challenges The general theology of Ephesians is direct, unambiguous, and presents no ideas or interpretations whose meanings are seriously contended. There are, however, some texts that require careful thought to rightly interpret, namely: 1) <a ref='Ephesians 2:8'>2:8</a> , in which one must decide if the salvation or the faith is the gift; 2) <a ref='Ephesians 4:5'>4:5</a> , in which the type of baptism must be discerned; and 3) <a ref='Ephesians 4:8'>4:8</a> , in its relationship to <a ref='Psalms 68:18'>Ps 68:18</a> .

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Ephesians 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>apostle.</b> The word means “messenger” and served as an official title for Paul and the 12 disciples (including Matthias, <a ref='Acts 1:26'>Ac 1:26</a> ), who were eyewitnesses of the resurrected Jesus and were chosen by God to lay the foundation for the church by preaching, teaching, and writing Scripture, accompanied by miracles (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 12:12'>2Co 12:12</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Ephesians 4:11'>4:11</a> .</i> <b>saints … faithful.</b> Designates those whom God has set apart from sin to Himself, made holy through their faith in Jesus Christ. The City of Ephesus Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Ephesians 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>Grace to you and peace.</b> A common greeting in the early church which Paul used in all his letters. <b>God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</b> From them came the authority with which Paul spoke (v. <a ref='Ephesians 1:1'>1</a> ) as well as the blessings of grace and peace to all believers. The conjunction “and” indicates equivalence; that is, the Lord Jesus Christ is equally divine with the Father. <a ref='Ephesians 1:3–14'>1:3–14</a> This passage describes God’s master plan for salvation in terms of the past (election, vv. <a ref='Ephesians 1:3–6'>3–6a</a> ), the present (redemption, vv. <a ref='Ephesians 1:6–11'>6b–11</a> ), and the future (inheritance, vv. <a ref='Ephesians 1:12–14'>12–14</a> ). It can also be viewed as emphasizing the Father (vv. <a ref='Ephesians 1:3–6'>3–6</a> ), the Son (vv. <a ref='Ephesians 1:7–12'>7–12</a> ), and the Spirit (vv. <a ref='Ephesians 1:13–16'>13–16</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>Blessed.</b> Derived from the same Greek word as “eulogy,” which means to praise or commend. This is the supreme duty of all creatures ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 1:18–21'>Ro 1:18–21</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Revelation 5:13'>Rev 5:13</a> ). <b>God … who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing.</b> In His providential grace, God has already given believers total blessing ( <a ref='Romans 8:28'>Ro 8:28</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:10'>Col 2:10</a> ; <a ref='James 1:17'>Jas 1:17</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 1:3'>2Pe 1:3</a> ). “Spiritual” does not refer to immaterial blessings as opposed to material ones, but rather to the work of God, who is the divine and spiritual source of all blessings. <b>in the heavenly</b> places. Lit. “in the heavenlies.” This refers to the realm of God’s complete, heavenly domain, from which all His blessings come (cf. v. <a ref='Ephesians 1:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:6'>2:6</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 3:10'>3:10</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 6:12'>6:12</a> ). <b>in Christ.</b> God’s superabundant blessings belong only to believers who are His children, by faith in Christ, so that what He has is theirs—including His righteousness, resources, privilege, position, and power (cf. <a ref='Romans 8:16–17'>Ro 8:16–17</a> ). Ephesians and Colossians Compared Though written near the same time and reflecting similar themes, the Books of Ephesians and Colossians have their own distinctive emphases. One could say that Ephesians is the epistle portraying the “Church of Christ,” while the focus of Colossians is the “Christ of the Church.” Ephesians Colossians Jesus Christ; Lord of the church Jesus Christ: Lord of the cosmos Emphasis on the church as the body of Christ, with Christ as the Head of the church Emphasis on Christ as the Head of the cosmos and the church Less personal and probably a circular epistle More personal and local church oriented Addresses the errors of false teaching less directly Speaks to the errors of particular false doctrines Common themes treated extensively Common themes treated briefly Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Ephesians 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>He chose us.</b> The doctrine of election is emphasized throughout Scripture (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:6'>Dt 7:6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 45:4'>Is 45:4</a> ; <a ref='John 6:44'>Jn 6:44</a> ; <a ref='Acts 13:48'>Ac 13:48</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:29'>Ro 8:29</a> ; <a ref='Romans 9:11'>9:11</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 1:3–4'>1Th 1:3–4</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:13'>2Th 2:13</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 2:10'>2Ti 2:10</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='1 Peter 1:2'>1Pe 1:2</a></i> ). The form of the Greek verb behind “chose” indicates that God not only chose <i>by</i> Himself but <i>for</i> Himself to the praise of His own glory (vv. <a ref='Ephesians 1:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Ephesians 1:12'>12</a> , <a ref='Ephesians 1:14'>14</a> ). God’s election or predestination does not operate apart from or nullify man’s responsibility to believe in Jesus as Lord and Savior (cf. <a ref='Matthew 3:1–2'>Mt 3:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 4:17'>4:17</a> ; <a ref='John 5:40'>Jn 5:40</a> ). <b>before the foundation of the world.</b> Through God’s sovereign will before the creation of the world and, therefore, obviously independent of human influence and apart from any human merit, those who are saved have become eternally united with Christ Jesus. Cf. <a ref='1 Peter 1:20'>1Pe 1:20</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:8'>Rev 13:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 17:8'>17:8</a> . <b>holy and blameless before Him.</b> This describes both a purpose and a result of God’s choosing those who are to be saved. Unrighteous persons are declared righteous, unworthy sinners are declared worthy of salvation, all because they are chosen “in Him” (Christ). This refers to Christ’s imputed righteousness granted to us ( <i>see notes on <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:9'>Php 3:9</a></i> ), a perfect righteousness which places believers in a holy and blameless position before God ( <a ref='Ephesians 5:27'>5:27</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:10'>Col 2:10</a> ), though daily living inevitably falls far short of His holy standard. <b>in love.</b> This phrase belongs at the start of v. <a ref='Ephesians 1:5'>5</a> , since it introduces the divine motive for God’s elective purpose. Cf. <a ref='Ephesians 2:4–5'>2:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:8'>Dt 7:8</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>by predestining us to adoption as sons.</b> Human parents can bestow their love, resources, and inheritance on an adopted child, but not their own distinct characteristics. But God miraculously gives His own nature to those whom He has elected and who have trusted in Christ. He makes them His children in the image of His divine Son, giving them not just Christ’s riches and blessings but also His very nature (cf. <a ref='John 15:15'>Jn 15:15</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:15'>Ro 8:15</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 1:6'>1:6</a> <b>to the praise of the glory of His grace.</b> The ultimate purpose of election to salvation is the glory of God (cf. vv. <a ref='Ephesians 1:12'>12</a> , <a ref='Ephesians 1:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 2:13'>Php 2:13</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:11–12'>2Th 1:11–12</a> ). <b>which He … bestowed … in the Beloved.</b> “Which” refers to the divine grace (undeserved love and favor) that has made it possible for sinners to be accepted by God through the substitutionary death and imputed righteousness provided by Jesus Christ (“the Beloved,” cf. <a ref='Matthew 3:17'>Mt 3:17</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:13'>Col 1:13</a> ). Because believers are accepted in Him, then they, like Him, are beloved of God. <a ref='Ephesians 1:7'>1:7a</a> <b>redemption through His blood.</b> The term used here relates to paying the required ransom to God for the release of a person from bondage. Christ’s sacrifice on the cross paid that price for every elect person enslaved by sin, buying them out of the slave market of iniquity ( <i>see notes on <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:18–19'>2Co 5:18–19</a></i> ). The price of redemption was death (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 17:11'>Lv 17:11</a> ; <a ref='Romans 3:24–25'>Ro 3:24–25</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:22'>Heb 9:22</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:18–19'>1Pe 1:18–19</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 5:8–10'>Rev 5:8–10</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 1:7–8'>1:7b–8</a> <b>the forgiveness of our transgressions … in all wisdom and insight.</b> Redemption brings in the limitless grace of God ( <a ref='Romans 5:20'>Ro 5:20</a> ) and forgiveness of sin (cf. <a ref='Matthew 26:28'>Mt 26:28</a> ; <a ref='Acts 13:38–39'>Ac 13:38–39</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 4:32'>Eph 4:32</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:13'>Col 2:13</a> ; <a ref='1 John 1:9'>1Jn 1:9</a> ). It brings divinely bestowed spiritual understanding. Cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:6–7'>1Co 2:6–7</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:12'>12</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:16'>16</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 1:10'>1:10</a> <b>the summing up of all things.</b> At the end of this world’s history, God will gather believers together in the millennial kingdom, called here “an administration of the fullness of the times,” meaning the completion of history ( <a ref='Revelation 20:1–6'>Rev 20:1–6</a> ). After that, God will gather everything to Himself in eternity future, and the new heaven and new earth will be created ( <a ref='Revelation 21:1'>Rev 21:1ff.</a> ). The new universe will be totally unified under Christ (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:27–28'>1Co 15:27–28</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 2:10–11'>Php 2:10–11</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>we have been made an inheritance.</b> Christ is the source of the believer’s divine inheritance, which is so certain that it is spoken of as if it has already been received. Cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:22–23'>1Co 3:22–23</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 1:3–4'>2Pe 1:3–4</a> . <b>having been predestined.</b> Before the earth was formed, God sovereignly determined that every elect sinner—however vile, useless, and deserving of death—by trusting in Christ would be made righteous. <i>See note on v. <a ref='Ephesians 1:4'>4</a> .</i> <b>who works all things.</b> The word translated “works” is the same one from which “energy,” “energetic,” and “energize” are derived. When God created the world, He gave it sufficient energy to begin immediately to operate as He had planned. It was not simply ready to function, but was created functioning. As God works out His plan according to “the counsel of His will,” He energizes every believer with the power necessary for his spiritual completion (cf. <a ref='Philippians 1:6'>Php 1:6</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 2:13'>2:13</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>to the praise of His glory.</b> God’s glory is the supreme purpose of redemption (cf. vv. <a ref='Ephesians 1:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Ephesians 1:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>after listening to the … truth … also believed.</b> The God-revealed gospel of Jesus Christ must be heard ( <a ref='Romans 10:17'>Ro 10:17</a> ) and believed ( <a ref='John 1:12'>Jn 1:12</a> ) to bring salvation. <a ref='Ephesians 1:13–14'>1:13–14</a> <b>sealed … with the Holy Spirit.</b> God’s own Spirit comes to indwell the believer and secures and preserves his eternal salvation. The sealing of which Paul speaks refers to an official mark of identification placed on a letter, contract, or other document. That document was thereby officially under the authority of the person whose stamp was on the seal. Four primary truths are signified by the seal: 1) security (cf. <a ref='Daniel 6:17'>Da 6:17</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 27:62–66'>Mt 27:62–66</a> ); 2) authenticity (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 21:6–16'>1Ki 21:6–16</a> ); 3) ownership (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:10'>Jer 32:10</a> ); and 4) authority (cf. <a ref='Es 8:8–12'>Es 8:8–12</a> ). The Holy Spirit is given by God as His pledge of the believer’s future inheritance in glory (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 1:21'>2Co 1:21</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 1:15'>1:15</a> <b>your love for all the saints.</b> Love for other believers evidences saving faith (cf. <a ref='John 13:34–35'>Jn 13:34–35</a> ; <a ref='1 John 4:16–18'>1Jn 4:16–18</a> ; <a ref='1 John 4:20'>4:20</a> ; <a ref='1 John 5:1'>5:1</a> ) and is a cause of thanksgiving (v. <a ref='Ephesians 1:16'>16</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 1:17'>1:17</a> <b>the God of our Lord Jesus Christ.</b> This is a designation of God that links Father and Son in essential nature as deity (cf. v. <a ref='Ephesians 1:3'>3a</a> ; <a ref='Romans 1:1–4'>Ro 1:1–4</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:3'>1Co 1:3</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 2:9–11'>Php 2:9–11</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:3'>1Pe 1:3</a> ; <a ref='2 John 1:3'>2Jn 3</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 1:17–18'>1:17–18</a> the <b>Spirit of wisdom … hope.</b> Paul was praying that believers will have the disposition of godly knowledge and insight of which the sanctified mind is capable (v. <a ref='Ephesians 1:8'>8</a> ), so as to grasp the greatness of the hope ( <a ref='Romans 8:29'>Ro 8:29</a> ; <a ref='1 John 3:2'>1Jn 3:2</a> ) and the inheritance that is theirs in Christ (vv. <a ref='Ephesians 1:3–14'>3–14</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 1:18'>1:18</a> <b>the eyes of your heart having been enlightened.</b> A spiritually enlightened mind is the only means of truly understanding and appreciating the hope and inheritance in Christ and of living obediently for Him. <a ref='Ephesians 1:19–20'>1:19–20</a> <b>surpassing greatness of His power.</b> God’s great power, that very power which raised Jesus from the dead and lifted Him by ascension back to glory to take His seat at God’s right hand, is given to every believer at the time of salvation and is always available (cf. <a ref='Acts 1:8'>Ac 1:8</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:29'>Col 1:29</a> ). Paul therefore did not pray that God’s power be given to believers, but that they be aware of the power they already possessed in Christ and use it (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 3:20'>3:20</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 1:21'>1:21</a> Paul wanted believers to comprehend the greatness of God compared to other heavenly beings. “Rule and authority and power and dominion” were traditional Jewish terms to designate angelic beings having a high rank among God’s hosts.

Salvation brings spiritual life to the dead. The power that raises believers out of death and makes them alive (cf. <a ref='Romans 6:1–7'>Ro 6:1–7</a> ) is the same power that energizes every aspect of Christian living (cf. <a ref='Romans 6:11–13'>Ro 6:11–13</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 2:6'>2:6</a> <b>raised us up … seated us with Him.</b> The tense of “raised” and “seated” indicates that these are immediate and direct results of salvation.

The supernatural realm where God reigns. In <a ref='Ephesians 3:10'>3:10</a> and <a ref='Ephesians 6:12'>6:12</a> , however, it also refers to the supernatural sphere where Satan temporarily rules.

It is the realm from which all divine revelation has come and where all praise and petitions go. <a ref='Ephesians 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>riches of His grace.</b> Salvation, of course, is very much for the believer’s blessing, but it is even more for the purpose of eternally glorifying God for bestowing on believers His endless and limitless grace and kindness. The whole of heaven glorifies Him for what He has done in saving sinners (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 3:10'>3:10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 7:10–12'>Rev 7:10–12</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 2:8'>2:8</a> <b>faith, and this not of yourselves.</b> “This” refers to the entire previous statement of salvation, not only the grace but the faith. Although men are required to believe for salvation, even that faith is part of the gift of God which saves and cannot be exercised by one’s own power. God’s grace is preeminent in every aspect of salvation (cf. <a ref='Romans 3:20'>Ro 3:20</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 2:16'>Ga 2:16</a> ).

The first was social, resulting from the animosity that had existed between Jews and Gentiles for thousands of years. Jews considered Gentiles to be outcasts, objects of derision, and reproach. The second and more significant type of alienation was spiritual, because Gentiles as a people were cut off from God in 5 different ways: 1) they were “without Christ,” the Messiah, having no Savior and Deliverer and without divine purpose or destiny. 2) They were “alienated from the citizenship of Israel.” God’s chosen people, the Jews, were a nation whose supreme King and Lord was God Himself, and from whose unique blessing and protection they benefitted. 3) Gentiles were “strangers to the covenants of promise,” not able to partake of God’s divine covenants in which He promised to give His people a land, a priesthood, a people, a nation, a kingdom, and a King—and to those who believe in Him, eternal life and heaven. 4) They had “no hope” because they had been given no divine promise. 5) They were “without God in the world.” While Gentiles had many gods, they did not recognize the true God because they did not want Him ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 1:18–26'>Ro 1:18–26</a></i> ). <a ref='Ephesians 2:13'>2:13</a> <b>far off.</b> A common term in rabbinical writings used to describe Gentiles, those who were apart from the true God (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 57:19'>Is 57:19</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:39'>Ac 2:39</a> ). <b>brought near.</b> Every person who trusts in Christ alone for salvation, Jew or Gentile, is brought into spiritual union and intimacy with God. This is the reconciliation of <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:18–21'>2Co 5:18–21</a> . The atoning work accomplished by Christ’s death on the cross washes away the penalty of sin and ultimately even its presence. <a ref='Ephesians 2:14'>2:14</a> <b>He Himself.</b> This emphatically indicates that Jesus alone is the believer’s source of peace (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 9:6'>Is 9:6</a> ). <b>the dividing wall of the partition.</b> This alludes to a wall in the temple that partitioned off the Court of the Gentiles from the areas accessible only to Jews. Paul referred to that wall as symbolic of the social, religious, and spiritual separation that kept Jews and Gentiles apart. <a ref='Ephesians 2:15'>2:15</a> <b>abolishing in His flesh the enmity.</b> Through His death, Christ abolished OT ceremonial laws, feasts, and sacrifices which uniquely separated Jews from Gentiles. God’s moral law (as summarized in the Ten Commandments and written on the hearts of all men, <a ref='Romans 2:15'>Ro 2:15</a> ) was not abolished but subsumed in the New Covenant, however, because it reflects His own holy nature ( <a ref='Matthew 5:17–19'>Mt 5:17–19</a> ). <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 22:37–40'>Mt 22:37–40</a> ; <a ref='Romans 13:8–10'>Ro 13:8–10</a> .</i> <b>one new man.</b> Christ does not exclude anyone who comes to Him, and those who are His are not spiritually distinct from one another. “New” translates a Greek word that refers to something completely unlike what it was before. It refers to being different in kind and quality.

This was accomplished by the cross where Jesus became a curse ( <a ref='Galatians 3:10–13'>Ga 3:10–13</a> ), taking God’s wrath so that divine justice was satisfied and reconciliation with God became a reality ( <i>see notes on <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:19–21'>2Co 5:19–21</a></i> ).

The resources of the Trinity belong to believers the moment they receive Christ, and the Holy Spirit presents them before the heavenly throne of God the Father, where they are welcome to come with boldness at any time. <i>See notes on <a ref='Romans 8:15–17'>Ro 8:15–17</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 4:6–7'>Ga 4:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 4:16'>Heb 4:16</a> .</i> <a ref='Ephesians 2:19'>2:19</a> <b>fellow citizens with the saints.</b> God’s kingdom is made up of the people from all time who have trusted in Him.

Christ’s building of His church will not be complete until every person who will believe in Him has done so ( <a ref='2 Peter 3:9'>2Pe 3:9</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 2:22'>2:22</a> <b>a dwelling of God in the Spirit.</b> The term for “dwelling” connotes a permanent home. God the Holy Spirit takes up permanent residence in His earthly sanctuary, the church, the vast spiritual body of all the redeemed (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:19–20'>1Co 6:19–20</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:16'>2Co 6:16</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 3:1'>3:1</a> <b>For this reason.</b> This refers back to the truths about the unity of believers that Paul has just discussed and introduces the motive for his prayer which begins in v. <a ref='Ephesians 3:14'>14</a> . <b>the prisoner of Christ Jesus.</b> Although Paul had been a prisoner for about two years in Caesarea and two years in Rome, he did not consider himself to be a prisoner of any government or person. Rather, he knew he was under Christ’s control, and every aspect of his life was in the Lord’s hands. He suffered imprisonment for preaching to Gentiles. See <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:8–15'>2Co 4:8–15</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 3:2–13'>3:2–13</a> In this parenthetical passage, Paul interrupted the thought begun in v. <a ref='Ephesians 3:1'>1</a> to reemphasize and to expand upon the truths he had just written. He was compelled to affirm his authority for teaching the oneness of Jew and Gentile in Christ (vv. <a ref='Ephesians 3:2–7'>2–7</a> ), a new and far-reaching truth that most of the Ephesians doubtless found difficult to comprehend or accept. <a ref='Ephesians 3:2'>3:2</a> <b>stewardship … given to me.</b> “Stewardship” means an administration, or management. Paul did not choose the stewardship of his apostleship or ministry. God had sovereignly commissioned him with the calling, spiritual gifts, opportunities, knowledge, and authority to minister as the apostle to the Gentiles (see <a ref='Acts 9:1–19'>Ac 9:1–19</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 1:12–13'>1Ti 1:12–13</a> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 15:15–16'>Ro 15:15–16</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 4:1'>1Co 4:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 9:16–17'>9:16–17</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 2:9'>Ga 2:9</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 3:4'>3:4</a> <b>the mystery of Christ.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Ephesians 1:10–12'>1:10–12</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:11–12'>2:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 13:11'>Mt 13:11</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:7'>1Co 2:7</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:26–27'>Col 1:26–27</a> .</i> There were many truths hidden and later revealed in the NT that are called mysteries.

Paul not only wrote of the mystery that, in Christ, Jew and Gentile become one in God’s sight and in His kingdom and family, but also explained and clarified that truth. He realized that spiritual knowledge must precede practical application. What is not properly understood cannot be properly applied. <a ref='Ephesians 3:5'>3:5</a> <b>in other generations was not made known.</b> Though God had promised universal blessing through Abraham ( <a ref='Genesis 12:3'>Ge 12:3</a> ), the full meaning of that promise became clear when Paul wrote <a ref='Galatians 3:28'>Ga 3:28</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 49:6'>Isaiah 49:6</a> predicted salvation to all races, but it was Paul who wrote of the fulfillment of that pledge ( <a ref='Acts 13:46–47'>Ac 13:46–47</a> ). Paul disclosed a truth that not even the greatest prophets understood—that within the church, composed of all the saved since Pentecost in one united body, there would be no racial, social, or spiritual distinctions. <a ref='Ephesians 3:6'>3:6</a> <b>Gentiles are fellow heirs.</b> A summary of <a ref='Ephesians 2:11–22'>2:11–22</a> . <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:12–13'>1Co 12:12–13</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:29'>Ga 3:29</a> .</i> <a ref='Ephesians 3:7'>3:7</a> <b>made a minister.</b> No man can make himself a minister (lit. servant) of God, because the calling, message, work, and empowering of genuine ministry to and for God are His prerogative alone to give.

This is typical of Paul (see <a ref='Romans 12:1'>Ro 12:1</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 5:1'>Ga 5:1</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 2:1'>Php 2:1</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 3:5'>Col 3:5</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:1'>1Th 4:1</a> ). <b>the prisoner in the Lord.</b> By mentioning his imprisonment again (see <a ref='Ephesians 3:1'>3:1</a> ), Paul gently reminded Ephesian believers that the faithful Christian walk can be costly and that he had paid a considerable personal price because of his obedience to the Lord. <b>walk worthy.</b> “Walk” is frequently used in the NT to refer to daily conduct. It sets the theme for the final 3 chapters. “Worthy” has the idea of living to match one’s position in Christ. The apostle urged his readers to be everything the Lord desires and empowers them to be. <b>calling.</b> This refers to God’s sovereign call to salvation, as always in the Epistles. <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 1:7'>Ro 1:7</a> .</i> The effectual call that saves is mentioned in <a ref='Ephesians 1:18'>1:18</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:29'>Ro 11:29</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:26'>1Co 1:26</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:14'>Php 3:14</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:11'>2Th 1:11</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 1:9'>2Ti 1:9</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 3:1'>Heb 3:1</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 4:2'>4:2</a> <b>humility.</b> “Humility” is a term not found in the Lat. or Greek vocabularies of Paul’s day. The Greek word apparently was coined by Christians, perhaps even by Paul himself, to describe a quality for which no other word was available. Humility, the most foundational Christian virtue ( <a ref='James 4:6'>Jas 4:6</a> ), is the quality of character commanded in the first beatitude ( <a ref='Matthew 5:3'>Mt 5:3</a> ), and describes the noble grace of Christ ( <a ref='Philippians 2:7–8'>Php 2:7–8</a> ). <b>gentleness.</b> “Meekness,” an inevitable product of humility, refers to that which is mild-spirited and self-controlled (cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:5'>Mt 5:5</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 11:29'>11:29</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 5:23'>Ga 5:23</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 3:12'>Col 3:12</a> ). <b>patience.</b> The Greek word lit. means long-tempered, and refers to a resolved patience that is an outgrowth of humility and gentleness (cf. <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:14'>1Th 5:14</a> ; <a ref='James 5:10'>Jas 5:10</a> ). <b>bearing with one another in love.</b> Humility, gentleness, and patience are reflected in a forbearing love for others that is continuous and unconditional (cf. <a ref='1 Peter 4:8'>1Pe 4:8</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:3'>4:3</a> <b>unity of the Spirit.</b> The Spirit-bestowed oneness of all true believers (see <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:17'>1Co 6:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:11–13'>12:11–13</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 1:27'>Php 1:27</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 2:2'>2:2</a> ) has created the bond of peace, the spiritual cord that surrounds and binds God’s holy people together. This bond is love ( <a ref='Colossians 3:14'>Col 3:14</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:4–6'>4:4–6</a> In this passage, Paul lists the particular areas of oneness, or unity: body, Spirit, hope, Lord, faith, baptism, and God and Father. He focuses on the Trinity—the Spirit in v. <a ref='Ephesians 4:4'>4</a> , the Son in v. <a ref='Ephesians 4:5'>5</a> , and the Father in v. <a ref='Ephesians 4:6'>6</a> . His point is not to distinguish between the Persons of the Godhead, but to emphasize that, although they are distinct Persons they are completely unified in every aspect of the divine nature and plan. <a ref='Ephesians 4:4'>4:4</a> <b>one body.</b> The church, the body of Christ, is composed of every believer since Pentecost without distinction, by the work of the “one Spirit” (see <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:11–13'>1Co 12:11–13</a> ). <b>one hope.</b> This is the pledge and promise of eternal inheritance given each believer ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:11–14'>1:11–14</a> ) and sealed to each believer by the one Spirit (v. <a ref='Ephesians 4:13'>13</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:5'>4:5</a> <b>one Lord.</b> See <a ref='Acts 4:12'>Ac 4:12</a> ; <a ref='Romans 10:12'>Ro 10:12</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 1:8'>Ga 1:8</a> . <b>one faith.</b> The body of doctrine revealed in the NT (cf. <a ref='Jude 1:3'>Jd 3</a> ). <b>one baptism.</b> This probably refers to the water baptism following salvation, a believer’s public confession of faith in Jesus Christ. Spiritual baptism, by which all believers are placed into the body of Christ ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:11–13'>1Co 12:11–13</a> ) is implied in v. <a ref='Ephesians 4:4'>4</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 4:6'>4:6</a> <b>one God.</b> This is the basic doctrine of God taught in Scripture (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:35'>Dt 4:35</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:4'>6:4</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:39'>32:39</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 45:14'>Is 45:14</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 46:9'>46:9</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 8:4–6'>1Co 8:4–6</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:7'>4:7</a> <b>But to each one.</b> This could be translated “in spite of that,” or “on the other hand,” contrasting what has just been said with what is about to be said, moving from the subject of the unity of believers (“all,” v. <a ref='Ephesians 4:6'>6</a> ) to that of the uniqueness of believers (“each one”). <b>grace.</b> Grace is a single-word definition of the gospel, the good news of God’s offering salvation to sinful and unworthy mankind. God is the God of grace because He is a God who freely gives; His giving has nothing to do with anything we have done, but is unmerited, unearned, and undeserved. <i>See notes on <a ref='Ephesians 2:7–10'>2:7–10</a> .</i> <b>the measure of Christ’s gift.</b> Each believer has a unique spiritual gift that God individually portions out according to His sovereign will and design. The Greek term for “gift” focuses not on the Spirit as the source like the term used in <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:1'>1Co 12:1</a> , nor on the grace that prompted it in <a ref='Romans 12:6'>Ro 12:6</a> , but on the freeness of the gift. For discussions of the gifts, <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 12:6–8'>Ro 12:6–8</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:4–10'>1Co 12:4–10</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 4:10'>1Pe 4:10</a></i> . <a ref='Ephesians 4:8'>4:8</a> When He ascended on high <b>.</b> Paul used an interpretive rendering of <a ref='Psalms 68:18'>Ps 68:18</a> as a parenthetical analogy to show how Christ received the right to bestow the spiritual gifts (v. <a ref='Ephesians 4:7'>7</a> ). <a ref='Ps 68'>Psalm 68</a> is a victory hymn composed by David to celebrate God’s conquest of the Jebusite city of Jerusalem and the triumphant ascent of God up to Mt. Zion (cf. <a ref='2Sa 6-7'>2Sa 6–7</a> ; <a ref='1Ch 13'>1Chr 13</a> ). After such a triumph, the king would bring home the spoils and the prisoners. Here Paul depicts Christ returning from His battle on earth back into the glory of the heavenly city with the trophies of His great victory at Calvary ( <i>see notes on <a ref='2 Corinthians 2:14–16'>2Co 2:14–16</a></i> ). led captive a host of captives <b>.</b> Through His crucifixion and resurrection, Christ conquered Satan and death, and in triumph returned to God those who were once sinners and prisoners of Satan (cf. <a ref='Colossians 2:15'>Col 2:15</a> ). gave gifts to men <b>.</b> He distributes the spoils throughout His kingdom. After His ascension came all the spiritual gifts empowered by the Spirit, who was then sent (see <a ref='John 7:39'>Jn 7:39</a> ; <a ref='John 14:12'>14:12</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:33'>Ac 2:33</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:9'>4:9</a> <b>ascended.</b> Jesus’ ascension from earth to heaven ( <a ref='Acts 1:9–11'>Ac 1:9–11</a> ), where He forever reigns with His Father. <b>descended.</b> This refers to Christ’s incarnation, when He came down from heaven as a man into the earth of suffering and death. <b>the lower parts of the earth.</b> These are in contrast to the highest heavens to which He afterward ascended (cf. <a ref='Psalms 139:8'>Ps 139:8</a> , <a ref='Psalms 139:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 44:23'>Is 44:23</a> ). The phrase here does not point to a specific place, but to the great depth, as it were, of the incarnation, including Christ’s descent, between His crucifixion and resurrection beyond the earth, the grave, and death, into the very pit of the demons, “the spirits in prison” ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Colossians 2:14–15'>Col 2:14–15</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 3:18–19'>1Pe 3:18–19</a></i> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:10'>4:10</a> <b>that He might fill all things.</b> After the Lord ascended, having fulfilled all prophecies and all His divinely ordained redemptive tasks, He gained the right to rule the church and to give gifts, as He was then filling the entire universe with His divine presence, power, sovereignty, and blessing (cf. <a ref='Philippians 2:9–11'>Php 2:9–11</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:11'>4:11</a> <b>He Himself gave some.</b> As evidenced by His perfect fulfillment of His Father’s will, Christ possessed the authority and sovereignty to assign the spiritual gifts (vv. <a ref='Ephesians 4:7–8'>7–8</a> ) to those He has called into service in His church. He gave not only gifts, but gifted men. <b>apostles.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Ephesians 2:20'>2:20</a> .</i> A term used particularly of the 12 disciples who had seen the risen Christ ( <a ref='Acts 1:22'>Ac 1:22</a> ), including Matthias, who replaced Judas. Later, Paul was uniquely set apart as the apostle to the Gentiles ( <a ref='Galatians 1:15–17'>Ga 1:15–17</a> ) and was numbered with the other apostles. He, too, miraculously encountered Jesus at his conversion on the Damascus Road ( <a ref='Acts 9:1–9'>Ac 9:1–9</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 1:15–17'>Ga 1:15–17</a> ). Those apostles were chosen directly by Christ, so as to be called “apostles of Jesus Christ” ( <a ref='Galatians 1:1'>Ga 1:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:1'>1Pe 1:1</a> ). They were given 3 basic responsibilities: 1) to lay the foundation of the church ( <a ref='Ephesians 2:20'>2:20</a> ); 2) to receive, declare, and write God’s Word ( <a ref='Ephesians 3:5'>3:5</a> ; <a ref='Acts 11:28'>Ac 11:28</a> ; <a ref='Acts 21:10–11'>21:10–11</a> ); and 3) to give confirmation of that Word through signs, wonders, and miracles ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 12:12'>2Co 12:12</a> ; cf. <a ref='Acts 8:6–7'>Ac 8:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 2:3–4'>Heb 2:3–4</a> ). The term “apostle” is used in more general ways of other men in the early church, such as Barnabas ( <a ref='Acts 14:4'>Ac 14:4</a> ), Silas, Timothy ( <a ref='1 Thessalonians 2:6'>1Th 2:6</a> ), and others ( <a ref='Romans 16:7'>Ro 16:7</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 2:25'>Php 2:25</a> ). They are called “messengers (or apostles) of the churches” ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 8:23'>2Co 8:23</a> ), rather than “apostles of Jesus Christ” like the 13. They were not self-perpetuating, nor was any apostle who died replaced. <b>prophets.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Ephesians 2:20'>2:20</a> .</i> Not ordinary believers who had the gift of prophecy but specially commissioned men in the early church. The office of prophet seems to have been exclusively for work within a local congregation. They were not “sent ones” as were the apostles (see <a ref='Acts 13:1–4'>Ac 13:1–4</a> ), but, as with the apostles, their office ceased with the completion of the NT. They sometimes spoke practical direct revelation for the church from God ( <a ref='Acts 11:21–28'>Ac 11:21–28</a> ) or expounded revelation already given (implied in <a ref='Acts 13:1'>Ac 13:1</a> ). They were not used for the reception of Scripture. Their messages were to be judged by other prophets for validity ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 14:32'>1Co 14:32</a> ) and had to conform to the teaching of the apostles (v. <a ref='1 Corinthians 14:37'>37</a> ). Those two offices were replaced by the evangelists and teaching pastors. <b>evangelists.</b> Men who proclaim the good news of salvation in Jesus Christ to unbelievers. Cf. the use of this term in <a ref='Acts 21:8'>Ac 21:8</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 4:5'>2Ti 4:5</a> . The related verb translated “to preach the gospel” is used 54 times and the related noun translated “gospel” is used 76 times in the NT. <b>pastors and teachers.</b> This phrase is best understood in context as a single office of leadership in the church. The Greek word translated “and” can mean “in particular” (see <a ref='1 Timothy 5:17'>1Ti 5:17</a> ). The normal meaning of pastor is “shepherd,” so the two functions together define the teaching shepherd. He is identified as one who is under the “great Shepherd” Jesus ( <a ref='Hebrews 13:20–21'>Heb 13:20–21</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:25'>1Pe 2:25</a> ). One who holds this office is also called an “elder” ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Titus 1:5–9'>Tit 1:5–9</a></i> ) and “bishop,” or “overseer” ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Timothy 3:1–7'>1Ti 3:1–7</a></i> ). <a ref='Acts 20:28'>Ac 20:28</a> and <a ref='1 Peter 5:1–2'>1Pe 5:1–2</a> bring all 3 terms together. <a ref='Ephesians 4:12'>4:12</a> <b>equipping.</b> This refers to restoring something to its original condition, or its being made fit or complete. In this context, it refers to leading Christians from sin to obedience. Scripture is the key to this process ( <i>see notes on <a ref='2 Timothy 3:16–17'>2Ti 3:16–17</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='John 15:3'>Jn 15:3</a> ). <b>saints.</b> All who believe in Jesus Christ. <i>See note on <a ref='Ephesians 1:1'>1:1</a> .</i> <b>the work of service.</b> The spiritual service required of every Christian, not just of church leaders (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:58'>1Co 15:58</a> ). <b>the building up of the body of Christ.</b> The spiritual edification, nurturing, and development of the church (cf. <a ref='Acts 20:32'>Ac 20:32</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:13'>4:13</a> <b>unity of the faith.</b> Faith here refers to the body of revealed truth that constitutes Christian teaching, particularly featuring the complete content of the gospel. Oneness and harmony among believers are possible only when they are built on the foundation of sound doctrine. <b>the full knowledge of the Son of God.</b> This does not refer to salvation knowledge, but to the deep knowledge of Christ that a believer comes to have through prayer, faithful study of His Word, and obedience to His commands (cf. <a ref='Philippians 3:8–10'>Php 3:8–10</a> , <a ref='Philippians 3:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:9–10'>Col 1:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:2'>2:2</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='1 John 2:12–14'>1Jn 2:12–14</a></i> ). <b>the fullness of Christ.</b> God wants every believer to manifest the qualities of His Son, who is Himself the standard for their spiritual maturity and perfection. <i>See notes on <a ref='Romans 8:29'>Ro 8:29</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 3:18'>2Co 3:18</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:28–29'>Col 1:28–29</a> .</i> <a ref='Ephesians 4:14'>4:14</a> <b>carried about by every wind of doctrine.</b> Spiritually immature believers who are not grounded in the knowledge of Christ through God’s Word are inclined to uncritically accept every sort of beguiling doctrinal error and fallacious interpretation of Scripture promulgated by deceitful, false teachers in the church. They must learn discernment ( <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:21–22'>1Th 5:21–22</a> ). See <a ref='Ephesians 3:1'>3:1</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 4:20'>4:20</a> . The NT is replete with warnings of such danger ( <a ref='Acts 20:30–31'>Ac 20:30–31</a> ; <a ref='Romans 16:17–18'>Ro 16:17–18</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 1:6–7'>Ga 1:6–7</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 4:1–7'>1Ti 4:1–7</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 2:15–18'>2Ti 2:15–18</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 2:1–3'>2Pe 2:1–3</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:15'>4:15</a> <b>speaking the truth in love.</b> Evangelism is most effective when the truth is proclaimed in love. This can be accomplished only by the spiritually mature believer who is thoroughly equipped in sound doctrine. Without maturity, the truth can be cold and love little more than sentimentality. <b>grow up … into Him.</b> Christians are to be completely yielded and obedient to the Lord’s will, subject to His controlling power and Christlike in all areas of their lives (cf. <a ref='Galatians 2:20'>Ga 2:20</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 1:21'>Php 1:21</a> ). <b>the head.</b> Given the picture of the church as a body whose head is Christ, “head” is used in the sense of authoritative leader, not “source,” which would have required a different anatomical picture. See <a ref='Ephesians 1:22'>1:22</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:23'>5:23</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 4:16'>4:16</a> <b>from whom.</b> This refers to the Lord. Power for producing mature, equipped believers comes not from the effort of those believers alone, but from their Head, the Lord Jesus Christ (cf. <a ref='Colossians 2:19'>Col 2:19</a> ). <b>properly measured working of each … part.</b> Godly, biblical church growth results from every member of the body fully using his spiritual gift, in submission to the Holy Spirit and in cooperation with other believers (cf. <a ref='Colossians 2:19'>Col 2:19</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:17–19'>4:17–19</a> In these verses, Paul gives 4 characteristics of the ungodly lifestyles which believers are to forsake. <a ref='Ephesians 4:17'>4:17</a> <b>walk no longer.</b> “Walk” expresses daily conduct and refers back to what Paul has said about the believer’s high calling in Christ Jesus (v. <a ref='Ephesians 4:1'>1</a> ). Because Christians are part of the body of Christ, have been spiritually gifted by the Holy Spirit, and are edified through other believers, they should not continue to live like the rest of the ungodly ( <a ref='1 John 2:6'>1Jn 2:6</a> ). <b>Gentiles.</b> All ungodly, unregenerate pagans (cf. <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:5'>1Th 4:5</a> which defines them). <b>the futility of their mind.</b> First, unbelievers are intellectually unproductive. As far as spiritual and moral issues are concerned, their rational processes are distorted and inadequate, inevitably failing to produce godly understanding or moral living. Their life is empty, vain, and without meaning (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:21–28'>Ro 1:21–28</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:14'>1Co 2:14</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:18'>Col 2:18</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:18'>4:18</a> <b>alienated from the life of God.</b> Second, unbelievers are spiritually separated from God, thus ignorant of God’s truth ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:14'>1Co 2:14</a> ), and their willing spiritual darkness and moral blindness is the result (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:21–24'>Ro 1:21–24</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 3:7'>2Ti 3:7</a> ). They are blind, or “hard” like a rock. <a ref='Ephesians 4:19'>4:19</a> <b>having become callous.</b> Third, unbelievers are morally insensitive. As they continue to sin and turn away from God, they become still more apathetic about moral and spiritual things (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:32'>Ro 1:32</a> ). <b>sensuality … impurity.</b> Fourth, unbelievers are behaviorally depraved (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:28'>Ro 1:28</a> ). As they willingly keep succumbing to sensuality and licentiousness, they increasingly lose moral restraint, especially in the area of sexual sins. Impurity is inseparable from greediness, which is a form of idolatry ( <a ref='Ephesians 5:5'>5:5</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 3:5'>Col 3:5</a> ). That some souls may not reach the extremes of vv. <a ref='Ephesians 4:17–19'>17–19</a> is due only to God’s common grace and the restraining influence of the Holy Spirit. <a ref='Ephesians 4:20–21'>4:20–21</a> <b>learn … heard … taught.</b> Three figurative descriptions of salvation, the new birth. <a ref='Ephesians 4:21'>4:21</a> <b>as truth is in Jesus.</b> The truth about salvation leads to the fullness of truth about God, man, creation, history, life, purpose, relationships, heaven, hell, judgment, and everything else that is truly important. John summed this up in <a ref='1 John 5:20'>1Jn 5:20</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 4:22'>4:22</a> <b>lay aside.</b> To strip away, as in taking off old, filthy clothes. This describes repentance from sin and submission to God at the point of salvation. <i>See notes on <a ref='Colossians 3:3–9'>Col 3:3–9</a></i> (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 55:6–7'>Is 55:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 19:16–22'>Mt 19:16–22</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:38–40'>Ac 2:38–40</a> ; <a ref='Acts 20:21'>20:21</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 1:9'>1Th 1:9</a> ). <b>the old man.</b> The worn out, useless, and unconverted sinful nature corrupted by deceit. Salvation is a spiritual union with Jesus Christ that is described as the death plus burial of the old self and the resurrection of the new self walking in newness of life. This transformation is Paul’s theme in <a ref='Romans 6:2–8'>Ro 6:2–8</a> ( <i>see notes there</i> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:23'>4:23</a> <b>be renewed in the spirit of your mind.</b> Salvation involves the mind ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 12:2'>Ro 12:2</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 10:5'>2Co 10:5</a></i> ), which is the center of thought, understanding, and belief, as well as of motive and action (cf. <a ref='Colossians 3:1–2'>Col 3:1–2</a> , <a ref='Colossians 3:10'>10</a> ). When a person becomes a Christian, God gives him a completely new spiritual and moral capability that a mind apart from Christ could never achieve (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:9–16'>1Co 2:9–16</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:24'>4:24</a> <b>put on the new man.</b> The renewal of the mind in salvation brings not simply a renovation of character, but transformation of the old to the new self (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:17'>2Co 5:17</a> ). <b>in</b> the likeness of <b>God has been created.</b> In Christ, the old self no longer exists as it had in the past; the new self is created in the very likeness of God (cf. <a ref='Galatians 2:20'>Ga 2:20</a> ). <b>in righteousness and holiness.</b> Righteousness relates to the Christian’s moral responsibility to his fellow men reflecting the second table of the law ( <a ref='Exodus 20:12–17'>Ex 20:12–17</a> ), while holiness refers to his responsibilities to God, reflecting the first table ( <a ref='Exodus 20:3–11'>Ex 20:3–11</a> ). There is still sin in the believer’s unredeemed human flesh ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 7:17–18'>Ro 7:17–18</a> , <a ref='Romans 7:20'>20</a> , <a ref='Romans 7:23'>23</a> , <a ref='Romans 7:25'>25</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:23'>8:23</a></i> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:25'>4:25</a> <b>laying aside falsehood.</b> More than simply telling direct falsehoods, lying also includes exaggeration and adding fabrications to something that is true. Cheating, making foolish promises, betraying a confidence, and making false excuses are all forms of lying, with which Christians should have no part (cf. <a ref='John 8:44'>Jn 8:44</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:9'>1Co 6:9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 21:8'>Rev 21:8</a> ). speak truth … with his neighbor <b>.</b> Quoted from <a ref='Zechariah 8:16'>Zec 8:16</a> . God’s work in the world is based on truth, and neither the church nor individual believers can be fit instruments for the Lord to use if they are not truthful. <a ref='Ephesians 4:26'>4:26</a> Be angry, and … do not sin Quoted from <a ref='Psalms 4:4'>Ps 4:4</a> . By NT standards, anger can be either good or bad, depending on motive and purpose. Paul may have been sanctioning righteous indignation, anger at evil. This type of anger hates injustice, immorality, ungodliness, and every other sin. When such anger is unselfish and based on love for God and others, it not only is permissible but commanded. Jesus expressed this righteous anger (see <a ref='Matthew 21:12'>Mt 21:12</a> ; <a ref='Mark 3:5'>Mk 3:5</a> ; <a ref='John 2:15'>Jn 2:15</a> ). <b>sun go down.</b> Even righteous anger can turn to bitterness, so it should be set aside by the end of each day. If anger is prolonged, it may become hostile and violate the instruction of <a ref='Romans 12:17–21'>Ro 12:17–21</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 4:28'>4:28</a> <b>steal no longer.</b> Stealing in any form is a sin and has no part in the life of a Christian. Rather, let him work, producing what is beneficial (cf. <a ref='Exodus 20:15'>Ex 20:15</a> ). The alternative to stealing is to provide for oneself, one’s family, and others what is God-honoring through honest, honorable means (cf. <a ref='2 Thessalonians 3:10–11'>2Th 3:10–11</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 5:8'>1Ti 5:8</a> ). <b>share with one who has need.</b> A Christian not only should harm no one but should continually endeavor to help those who are in need. See <a ref='Luke 14:13–14'>Lk 14:13–14</a> ; <a ref='Acts 20:33–35'>Ac 20:33–35</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 4:29'>4:29</a> <b>unwholesome word.</b> The word for “unwholesome” refers to that which is foul or rotten, such as spoiled fruit or putrid meat. Foul language of any sort should never pass a Christian’s lips, because it is totally out of character with his new life in Christ (see <a ref='Colossians 3:8'>Col 3:8</a> ; <a ref='James 3:6–8'>Jas 3:6–8</a> ; cf. <a ref='Psalms 141:3'>Ps 141:3</a> ). <b>good for building up.</b> The Christian’s speech should be instructive, encouraging, uplifting, (even when it must be corrective), and suited for the moment (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 15:23'>Pr 15:23</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 25:11'>25:11</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 24:26'>24:26</a> ). <b>grace to those who hear.</b> Cf. <a ref='Colossians 4:6'>Col 4:6</a> . Because believers have been saved by grace and kept by grace, they should live and speak with grace. Our Lord set the standard ( <a ref='Luke 4:22'>Lk 4:22</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:30'>4:30</a> <b>do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God.</b> God is grieved when His children refuse to change the old ways of sin for those righteous ways of the new life. It should be noted that such responses by the Holy Spirit indicate He is a person. His personhood is also indicated by personal pronouns ( <a ref='John 14:17'>Jn 14:17</a> ; <a ref='John 16:13'>16:13</a> ), His personal care of believers ( <a ref='John 14:16'>Jn 14:16</a> , <a ref='John 14:26'>26</a> ; <a ref='John 15:26'>15:26</a> ), His intellect ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:11'>1Co 2:11</a> ), feelings ( <a ref='Romans 8:27'>Ro 8:27</a> ), will ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:11'>1Co 12:11</a> ), speaking ( <a ref='Acts 13:2'>Ac 13:2</a> ), convicting ( <a ref='John 16:8–11'>Jn 16:8–11</a> ), interceding ( <a ref='Romans 8:26'>Ro 8:26</a> ), guiding ( <a ref='John 16:13'>Jn 16:13</a> ), glorifying Christ ( <a ref='John 16:14'>Jn 16:14</a> ), and serving God ( <a ref='Acts 16:6–7'>Ac 16:6–7</a> ). <b>sealed for the day of redemption.</b> The Holy Spirit is the guarantor of eternal redemption in Christ for those who believe in Him ( <i>see note on <a ref='Ephesians 1:13–14'>1:13–14</a></i> ). <a ref='Ephesians 4:31–32'>4:31–32</a> These verses summarize the changes in the life of a believer mentioned in vv. <a ref='Ephesians 4:17–30'>17–30</a> . “Bitterness” reflects a smoldering resentment. “Wrath” has to do with rage, the passion of a moment. “Anger” is a more internal, deep hostility. “Shouting” is the outcry of strife out of control. “Slander” is evil speaking. “Malice” is the general Greek term for evil, the root of all vices. <a ref='Ephesians 4:32'>4:32</a> <b>just as God in Christ also has graciously forgiven you.</b> Those who have been forgiven so much by God should, of all people, forgive the relatively small offenses against them by others. The most graphic illustration of this truth is the parable of <a ref='Matthew 18:21–35'>Mt 18:21–35</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 5:1'>5:1</a> <b>be imitators of God.</b> The Christian has no greater calling or purpose than that of imitating his Lord ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Ephesians 3:16'>3:16</a> , <a ref='Ephesians 3:19'>19</a></i> ). That is the very purpose of sanctification, growing in likeness to the Lord while serving Him on earth (cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:48'>Mt 5:48</a> ). The Christian life is designed to reproduce godliness as modeled by the Savior and Lord, Jesus Christ, in whose image believers have been recreated through the new birth (cf. <a ref='Romans 8:29'>Ro 8:29</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 3:18'>2Co 3:18</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:14–16'>1Pe 1:14–16</a> ). As God’s dear children, believers are to become more and more like their heavenly Father ( <a ref='Matthew 5:48'>Mt 5:48</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:15–16'>1Pe 1:15–16</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 5:2'>5:2</a> <b>Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us.</b> The Lord is the supreme example in His self-sacrificing love for lost sinners ( <a ref='Ephesians 4:32'>4:32</a> ; <a ref='Romans 5:8–10'>Ro 5:8–10</a> ). He took human sin upon Himself and gave up His very life that men might be redeemed from their sin, receive a new and holy nature, and inherit eternal life ( <i>see note on <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a></i> ). They are henceforth to be imitators of His great love in the newness and power of the Holy Spirit, who enables them to demonstrate divine love. <b>a fragrant aroma.</b> Christ’s offering of Himself for fallen man pleased and glorified His heavenly Father, because it demonstrated in the most complete and perfect way God’s sovereign, perfect, unconditional, and divine kind of love. Leviticus describes 5 offerings commanded by God for Israel. The first 3 were: 1) the burnt offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 1:1–17'>Lv 1:1–17</a> ), depicting Christ’s perfection; 2) the grain offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 2:1–16'>Lv 2:1–16</a> ), depicting Christ’s total devotion to God in giving His life to please the Father; and 3) the peace offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 3:1–17'>Lv 3:1–17</a> ), depicting His peacemaking between God and man. All 3 of these were a “soothing aroma to Yahweh” ( <a ref='Leviticus 1:9'>Lv 1:9</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 1:13'>13</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 1:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 2:2'>2:2</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 2:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 2:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 3:5'>3:5</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 3:16'>16</a> ). The other two offerings, the sin offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 4:1–5:13'>Lv 4:1—5:13</a> ) and the guilt, or trespass, offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 5:14–6:7'>Lv 5:14—6:7</a> ), were repulsive to God because, though they depicted Christ, they depicted Him as bearing sin (cf. <a ref='Matthew 27:46'>Mt 27:46</a> ). In the end, when redemption was accomplished, the whole work pleased God completely. <a ref='Ephesians 5:3'>5:3</a> <b>immorality … greed.</b> In absolute contrast to God’s holiness and love, such sins as these exist (also in v. <a ref='Ephesians 5:5'>5</a> ), by which Satan seeks to destroy God’s divine work in His children and turn them as far away as possible from His image and will. As do many other Scriptures, this verse shows the close connection between sexual sin and other forms of impurity and greed. An immoral person is inevitably greedy. Such sins are so godless that the world should never have reason even to suspect their presence in Christians. <a ref='Ephesians 5:4'>5:4</a> <b>not fitting.</b> These 3 inappropriate sins of the tongue include any speech that is obscene and degrading or foolish and dirty, as well as suggestive and immoral. All such are destructive of holy living and godly testimony and should be confessed, forsaken, and replaced by open expressions of thankfulness to God (cf. <a ref='Colossians 3:8'>Col 3:8</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 5:5'>5:5</a> <b>For this you know.</b> Paul had taught this truth many times when he pastored the church at Ephesus, and it should have been clear in their minds. God never tolerates sin, which has no place at all in His kingdom, nor will any person whose life pattern is one of habitual immorality, impurity, and greed (see v. <a ref='Ephesians 5:3'>3</a> ) be in His kingdom, because no such person is saved ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:9–10'>1Co 6:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 5:17–21'>Ga 5:17–21</a> ; <a ref='1 John 3:9–10'>1Jn 3:9–10</a></i> ). <b>the kingdom of Christ and God.</b> A reference to the sphere of salvation where Christ rules the redeemed. <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 1:3'>Ac 1:3</a> .</i> <a ref='Ephesians 5:6'>5:6</a> <b>deceive you.</b> No Christian will be sinless in this present life, but it is dangerously deceptive for Christians to offer assurance of salvation to a professing believer whose life is characterized by persistent sin and who shows no shame for that sin or hunger for the holy and pure things of God. They are headed for wrath ( <a ref='Ephesians 2:2'>2:2</a> ), and believers must not partner in any of their wickedness (v. <a ref='Ephesians 5:7'>7</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 5:8'>5:8</a> <b>darkness … light.</b> “Darkness” describes the character of the life of the unconverted as void of truth and virtue in intellectual and moral matters (cf. <a ref='1 John 1:5–7'>1Jn 1:5–7</a> ). The realm of darkness is presided over by the “authority of darkness” ( <a ref='Luke 22:53'>Lk 22:53</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:13'>Col 1:13</a> ), who rules those headed for “outer darkness” ( <a ref='Matthew 8:12'>Mt 8:12</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 2:17'>2Pe 2:17</a> ). Tragically, sinners love the darkness ( <a ref='John 3:19–21'>Jn 3:19–21</a> ). It is that very darkness from which salvation in Christ delivers sinners ( <i>see notes on <a ref='John 8:12'>Jn 8:12</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:13'>Col 1:13</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:9'>1Pe 2:9</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Psalms 27:1'>Ps 27:1</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 5:9'>5:9</a> <b>fruit of that light.</b> This speaks of that which is produced by walking in the light (cf. <a ref='1 John 1:5–7'>1Jn 1:5–7</a> ), namely moral excellence of heart, righteous behavior, and truthfulness (honesty or integrity). <i>See notes on <a ref='Galatians 5:22–23'>Ga 5:22–23</a> .</i> <a ref='Ephesians 5:10'>5:10</a> <b>trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.</b> “Trying to learn” carries the idea of testing or proving to learn by clear and convincing evidence what is truly honoring to God. The point is that, as believers walk in the light of the truth, the knowledge of the Lord’s will becomes clear. See <a ref='Romans 12:1–2'>Ro 12:1–2</a> where Paul says the same thing, stating that it is only after presenting ourselves as living sacrifices to God that we can know His acceptable will. This relates to assurance of salvation also (see <a ref='1 Peter 1:5–11'>1Pe 1:5–11</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 5:11'>5:11</a> <b>do not participate in … darkness.</b> Paul’s instruction is plain and direct: Christians are to faithfully live in righteousness and purity and have nothing at all to do with the evil ways and works of Satan and the world. The two ways of living are unalterably opposed to each other and mutually exclusive. Cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 5:9–11'>1Co 5:9–11</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:14–18'>2Co 6:14–18</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 3:6'>2Th 3:6</a> , <a ref='2 Thessalonians 3:14'>14</a> . <b>instead … expose them.</b> The Christian’s responsibility does not stop with his own rejection of evil. He is also responsible for exposing and opposing darkness wherever it is found, especially when it is found in the church. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 18:15–17'>Mt 18:15–17</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 6:1–2'>Ga 6:1–2</a> .</i> <a ref='Ephesians 5:12'>5:12</a> <b>disgraceful even to speak.</b> Some sins are so despicable that they should be sealed off from direct contact and not even mentioned, much less discussed, except in order to contradict and oppose them. Merely talking about them can be morally and spiritually corruptive. Positive proclamation of the pure truth in the light of the Word exposes all evil (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 6:23'>Pr 6:23</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 3:16'>2Ti 3:16</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 5:13'>5:13</a> <b>everything that becomes visible is light.</b> This phrase should probably be part of v. <a ref='Ephesians 5:14'>14</a> , and is better translated “for it is light that makes everything visible.” The pure and illuminating light of God’s Word exposes all the secrets of sin. <a ref='Ephesians 5:14'>5:14</a> Using this quotation from <a ref='Isaiah 60:1'>Is 60:1</a> , Paul extended an invitation for salvation to the unsaved, in order that they may be transformed from children of darkness into children of God’s holy light (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 4:18'>Pr 4:18</a> ). These words may have been part of an early church Easter hymn used as an invitation to unbelievers. They express a capsule view of the gospel. Cf. the invitations in <a ref='Isaiah 55:1–3'>Is 55:1–3</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 55:6–7'>6–7</a> and in <a ref='James 4:6–10'>Jas 4:6–10</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 5:15'>5:15</a> <b>look carefully how you walk, not as unwise but as wise.</b> To live morally is to live wisely. Biblically, an “unwise man” is not so named because of intellectual limits, but because of unbelief and the consequent abominable deeds ( <a ref='Psalms 14:1'>Ps 14:1</a> ; <a ref='Romans 1:22'>Ro 1:22</a> ). He lives apart from God and against God’s law ( <a ref='Proverbs 1:7'>Pr 1:7</a> , <a ref='Proverbs 1:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 14:9'>14:9</a> ), and can’t comprehend the truth ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:14'>1Co 2:14</a> ) or his true condition ( <a ref='Romans 1:21–22'>Ro 1:21–22</a> ). Certainly, believers are to avoid behaving like fools (see <a ref='Luke 24:25'>Lk 24:25</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:1–3'>Ga 3:1–3</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 5:16'>5:16</a> <b>redeeming the time.</b> The Greek word for “time” denotes a fixed, measured, allocated season. We are to make the most of our time on this evil earth in fulfilling God’s purposes, lining up every opportunity for useful worship and service. <i>See note on <a ref='1 Peter 1:17'>1Pe 1:17</a> .</i> Be aware of the brevity of life ( <a ref='Psalms 39:4–5'>Pss 39:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:46–47'>89:46–47</a> ; <a ref='James 4:14'>Jas 4:14</a> , <a ref='James 4:17'>17</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 5:17'>5:17</a> <b>do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</b> Knowing and understanding God’s will through His Word is spiritual wisdom. For example, God’s will revealed to us is that people should be saved ( <a ref='1 Timothy 2:3–4'>1Ti 2:3–4</a> ), Spirit-filled (v. <a ref='Ephesians 5:18'>18</a> ), sanctified ( <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:3'>1Th 4:3</a> ), submissive ( <a ref='1 Peter 2:13–15'>1Pe 2:13–15</a> ), suffering ( <a ref='1 Peter 2:20'>1Pe 2:20</a> ), and thankful ( <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:18'>1Th 5:18</a> ). Jesus is the supreme example for all (see <a ref='John 4:34'>Jn 4:34</a> ; <a ref='John 5:19'>5:19</a> , <a ref='John 5:30'>30</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 4:1–2'>1Pe 4:1–2</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 5:18'>5:18</a> <b>And do not get drunk with wine.</b> Although Scripture consistently condemns all drunkenness ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Proverbs 23:29–35'>Pr 23:29–35</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 31:4–5'>31:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 5:11–12'>Is 5:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 28:7–8'>28:7–8</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 5:11'>1Co 5:11</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 4:3'>1Pe 4:3</a> ), the context suggests that Paul is speaking here especially about the drunken orgies commonly associated with many pagan worship ceremonies of that day. They were supposed to induce some ecstatic communion with the deities. Paul refers to such as the “cup of demons” ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:19–20'>1Co 10:19–20</a></i> ). <b>but be filled with the Spirit.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Acts 2:4'>Ac 2:4</a> ; <a ref='Acts 4:8'>4:8</a> , <a ref='Acts 4:31'>31</a> ; <a ref='Acts 6:3'>6:3</a> .</i> True communion with God is not induced by drunkenness, but by the Holy Spirit. Paul is not speaking of the Holy Spirit’s indwelling ( <a ref='Romans 8:9'>Ro 8:9</a> ) or the baptism by Christ with the Holy Spirit ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:13'>1Co 12:13</a> ), because every Christian is indwelt and baptized by the Spirit at the time of salvation. He is rather giving a command for believers to live continually under the influence of the Spirit by letting the Word control them ( <i>see note on <a ref='Colossians 3:16'>Col 3:16</a></i> ), pursuing pure lives, confessing all known sin, dying to self, surrendering to God’s will, and depending on His power in all things. Being filled with the Spirit is living in the conscious presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, letting His mind, through the Word, dominate everything that is thought and done. Being filled with the Spirit is the same as walking in the Spirit ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Galatians 5:16–23'>Ga 5:16–23</a></i> ). Christ exemplified this way of life ( <a ref='Luke 4:1'>Lk 4:1</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 5:19–21'>5:19–21</a> These verses summarize the immediate personal consequences of obeying the command to be filled with the Spirit, namely singing, giving thanks, and humbly submitting to others. The rest of the epistle features instruction based on obedience to this command. <a ref='Ephesians 5:19'>5:19</a> <b>speaking to one another.</b> This is to be public ( <a ref='Hebrews 2:12'>Heb 2:12</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Psalms 33:1'>Pss 33:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 40:3'>40:3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 96:1–2'>96:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 149:1'>149:1</a> ; <a ref='Acts 16:25'>Ac 16:25</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:3'>Rev 14:3</a> . <b>psalms.</b> Old Testament psalms put to music, primarily, but the term was used also of vocal music in general. The early church sang the Psalms. <b>hymns.</b> Perhaps songs of praise distinguished from the Psalms which exalted God, in that they focused on the Lord Jesus Christ. <b>spiritual songs.</b> Probably songs of personal testimony expressing truths of the grace of salvation in Christ. <b>making melody.</b> Lit. means to pluck a stringed instrument, so it could refer primarily to instrumental music, while including vocal also. <b>with your heart to the Lord.</b> Not just public, but private. The Lord Himself is both the source and the object of the believer’s song-filled heart. That such music pleases God can be seen in the account of the temple dedication, when the singing so honored the Lord that His glory came down ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 5:12'>2Chr 5:12</a> , <a ref='2 Chronicles 5:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 5:20'>5:20</a> <b>always giving thanks for all things.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:18'>1Th 5:18</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:15'>2Co 4:15</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 9:12'>9:12</a> , <a ref='2 Corinthians 9:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 4:6'>Php 4:6</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:7'>Col 2:7</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 13:15'>Heb 13:15</a> . Believers’ thankfulness is for who God is and for what He has done through His Son, their Savior and Lord. <a ref='Ephesians 5:21'>5:21</a> <b>being subject to one another.</b> Paul here made a transition and introduced his teaching about specific relationships of authority and submission among Christians ( <a ref='Ephesians 5:22–6:9'>5:22—6:9</a> ) by declaring unequivocally that every Spirit-filled Christian is to be a humble, submissive Christian. This is foundational to all the relationships in this section. No believer is inherently superior to any other believer. In their standing before God, they are equal in every way ( <a ref='Galatians 3:28'>Ga 3:28</a> ). <b>in the fear of Christ.</b> The believer’s continual reverence for God is the basis for his submission to other believers. Cf. <a ref='Proverbs 9:10'>Pr 9:10</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 5:22'>5:22</a> <b>Wives,</b> be subject <b>to your own husbands.</b> Having established the foundational principle of submission (v. <a ref='Ephesians 5:21'>21</a> ), Paul applied it first to the wife. The command is unqualified, applying to every Christian wife, no matter what her own abilities, education, knowledge of Scripture, spiritual maturity, or any other qualifications might be in relation to those of her husband. The submission is not the husband’s to command, but for the wife to willingly and lovingly offer. “Your own husbands” limits her submission to the one man God has placed over her, and also gives a balancing emphasis that he is hers as a personal intimate possession ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:16'>SS 2:16</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:3'>6:3</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:10'>7:10</a> ). She submits to the man she possesses as her own. <b>as to the Lord.</b> Because the obedient, spiritual wife’s supreme submission is to the Lord, her attitude is that she lovingly submits as an act of obedience to the Lord who has given this command as His will for her, regardless of her husband’s personal worthiness or spiritual condition. Cf. vv. <a ref='Ephesians 5:5–9'>5–9</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 5:23'>5:23</a> <b>husband is the head … Christ … is the head.</b> The Spirit-filled wife recognizes that her husband’s role in giving leadership is not only God-ordained, but is a reflection of Christ’s own loving, authoritative headship of the church. <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Corinthians 11:3'>1Co 11:3</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Ephesians 1:22–23'>1:22–23</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 4:15'>4:15</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:18'>Col 1:18</a> ; <a ref='Titus 2:4–5'>Tit 2:4–5</a> . <b>Savior.</b> As the Lord delivered His church from the dangers of sin, death, and hell, so the husband provides for, protects, preserves, and loves his wife, leading her to blessing as she submits. Cf. <a ref='Titus 1:4'>Tit 1:4</a> ; <a ref='Titus 2:13'>2:13</a> ; <a ref='Titus 3:6'>3:6</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 5:25'>5:25</a> <b>love your wives.</b> Though the husband’s authority has been established (vv. <a ref='Ephesians 5:22–24'>22–24</a> ), the emphasis moves to the supreme responsibility of husbands in regard to their wives, which is to love them with the same unreserved, selfless, and sacrificial love that Christ has for His church. Christ gave everything He had, including His own life, for the sake of His church, and that is the standard of sacrifice for a husband’s love of his wife. Cf. <a ref='Colossians 3:19'>Col 3:19</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 5:26–27'>5:26–27</a> <b>sanctify … cleansed … holy … blameless.</b> This speaks of the love of Christ for His church. Saving grace makes believers holy by the agency of the Word of God ( <a ref='Titus 2:1–9'>Tit 2:1–9</a> ; <a ref='Titus 3:5'>3:5</a> ) so that they may be a pure bride. For husbands to love their wives as Christ does His church demands a purifying love. Since divine love seeks to completely cleanse those who are loved from every form of sin and evil, a Christian husband should not be able to bear the thought of anything sinful in the life of his wife that displeases God. His greatest desire for her should be that she become perfectly conformed to Christ, so he leads her to purity. <i>See note on <a ref='2 Corinthians 11:2'>2Co 11:2</a> .</i> <a ref='Ephesians 5:28'>5:28</a> <b>as their own bodies.</b> Here is one of the most poignant and compelling descriptions of the oneness that should characterize Christian marriage. A Christian husband is to care for his wife with the same devotion that he naturally manifests as he cares for himself (v. <a ref='Ephesians 5:29'>29</a> )—even more so, since his self-sacrificing love causes him to put her first (cf. <a ref='Philippians 2:1–4'>Php 2:1–4</a> ). <b>loves his own wife loves himself.</b> In the end, a husband who loves his wife in these ways brings great blessing to himself from her and from the Lord. <a ref='Ephesians 5:29'>5:29</a> <b>nourishes and cherishes.</b> These express the twin responsibilities of providing for her needs so as to help her grow mature in Christ and to provide warm and tender affection to give her comfort and security. <a ref='Ephesians 5:30'>5:30</a> <b>members of His body.</b> The Lord provides for His church because it is so intimately and inseparably connected to Him. If He did not care for His church, He would be diminishing His own glory which the church brings to Him by praise and obedience. So, in marriage, the husband’s life is so intimately joined to the wife’s that they are one. When he cares for her, he cares for himself (v. <a ref='Ephesians 5:29'>29</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 5:31'>5:31</a> Quoted from <a ref='Genesis 2:24'>Ge 2:24</a> ( <i>see note there</i> ). Paul reinforces the divine plan for marriage which God instituted at creation, emphasizing its permanence and unity. The union of marriage is intimate and unbreakable. “Joined” is a word used to express having been glued or cemented together, emphasizing the permanence of the union ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Malachi 2:16'>Mal 2:16</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 19:5–9'>Mt 19:5–9</a></i> ). <a ref='Ephesians 5:32'>5:32</a> <b>mystery is great.</b> In the NT, “mystery” identifies some reality hidden in the past and revealed in the NT age to be written in Scripture. Marriage is a sacred reflection of the magnificent and beautiful mystery of union between the Messiah and His church, completely unknown until the NT. <i>See notes on <a ref='Ephesians 3:4–5'>3:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 13:11'>Mt 13:11</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:7'>1Co 2:7</a> .</i> <a ref='Ephesians 5:33'>5:33</a> <b>each individual among you.</b> The intimacy and sacredness of the love relationship between believing marriage partners are to be a visual expression of the love between Christ and His church. <a ref='Ephesians 6:1'>6:1</a> <b>obey … in the Lord.</b> See <a ref='Colossians 3:20'>Col 3:20</a> . The child in the home is to be willingly under the authority of parents with obedient submission to them as the agents of the Lord placed over him, obeying parents as if obeying the Lord Himself. The reasoning here is simply that such is the way God has designed and required it (“right”). Cf. <a ref='Hosea 14:9'>Hos 14:9</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 6:2–3'>6:2–3</a> Honor <b>.</b> While v. <a ref='Ephesians 6:1'>1</a> speaks of action, this term speaks of attitude, as Paul deals with the motive behind the action. When God gave His law in the Ten Commandments, the first law governing human relationships was this one ( <a ref='Exodus 20:12'>Ex 20:12</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:16'>Dt 5:16</a> ). It is the only command of the 10 that relates to the family because that principle alone secures the family’s fulfillment. Cf. <a ref='Exodus 21:15'>Ex 21:15</a> , <a ref='Exodus 21:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 20:9'>Lv 20:9</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 15:3–6'>Mt 15:3–6</a> . Proverbs affirms this principle (see <a ref='Proverbs 1:8'>1:8</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 3:1'>3:1</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 4:1–4'>4:1–4</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 7:1–3'>7:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 10:1'>10:1</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 17:21'>17:21</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 19:13'>19:13</a> , <a ref='Proverbs 19:26'>26</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 28:24'>28:24</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 6:2'>6:2</a> <b>the first commandment with a promise.</b> Although submission to parents should first of all be for the Lord’s sake, He has graciously added the promise of special blessing for those who obey this command. <i>See note on <a ref='Exodus 20:12'>Ex 20:12</a></i> , the verse from which Paul quotes (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:16'>Dt 5:16</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 6:4'>6:4</a> <b>Fathers.</b> The word technically refers to male parents, but was also used of parents in general. Since Paul had been speaking of both parents (vv. <a ref='Ephesians 6:1–3'>1–3</a> ), he probably had both in mind here. The same word is used in <a ref='Hebrews 11:23'>Heb 11:23</a> for Moses’ parents. <b>do not provoke.</b> In the pagan world of Paul’s day, and even in many Jewish households, most fathers ruled their families with rigid and domineering authority. The desires and welfare of wives and children were seldom considered. The apostle makes clear that a Christian father’s authority over his children does not allow for unreasonable demands and strictures that might drive his children to anger, despair, and resentment. <b>discipline and instruction of the Lord.</b> This calls for systematic discipline and instruction, which brings children to respect the commands of the Lord as the foundation of all of life, godliness, and blessing. Cf. <a ref='Proverbs 13:24'>Pr 13:24</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 12:5–11'>Heb 12:5–11</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 6:5'>6:5</a> <b>Slaves, be obedient.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Colossians 3:22–4:1'>Col 3:22—4:1</a> .</i> Slaves in both Greek and Roman culture had no rights legally and were treated as commodities. There was much abuse and seldom good treatment of slaves. The Bible does not speak against slavery itself, but against its abuses (cf. <a ref='Exodus 21:16'>Ex 21:16</a> , <a ref='Exodus 21:26–27'>26–27</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 25:10'>Lv 25:10</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:15–16'>Dt 23:15–16</a> ). Paul’s admonition applies equally well to all employees. The term “obedient” refers to continuous, uninterrupted submission to one’s earthly master or employer, the only exception being in regard to a command that involves clear disobedience of God’s Word as illustrated in <a ref='Acts 4:19–20'>Ac 4:19–20</a> . <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Timothy 6:1–2'>1Ti 6:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Titus 2:9–10'>Tit 2:9–10</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:18–20'>1Pe 2:18–20</a> .</i> <b>according to the flesh.</b> Human masters, that is. <b>with fear and trembling.</b> This is not fright, but respect for their authority. Even if an employer does not deserve respect in his own right (see <a ref='1 Peter 2:18'>1Pe 2:18</a> ), it should nevertheless be given to him with genuine sincerity as if one was serving Christ Himself. To serve one’s employer well is to serve Christ well. Cf. <a ref='Colossians 3:23–24'>Col 3:23–24</a> . <a ref='Ephesians 6:6'>6:6</a> <b>eyeservice.</b> Working well only when being watched by the boss. <b>men-pleasers.</b> Working only to promote one’s welfare, rather than to honor the employer and the Lord, whose servants we really are. <a ref='Ephesians 6:7–8'>6:7–8</a> Cf. <a ref='Colossians 3:23'>Col 3:23</a> . God’s credits and rewards will be appropriate to the attitude and action of our work. No good thing done for His glory will go unrewarded. <a ref='Ephesians 6:9'>6:9</a> <b>And masters, do the same things to them.</b> There should be mutual honor and respect from Christian employers to their employees, based on their common allegiance to the Lord. <b>giving up threatening.</b> The Spirit-filled boss uses his authority and power with justice and grace—never putting people under threats, never abusive or inconsiderate. He realizes that he has a heavenly Master who is impartial (cf. <a ref='Acts 10:34'>Ac 10:34</a> ; <a ref='Romans 2:11'>Ro 2:11</a> ; <a ref='James 2:9'>Jas 2:9</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 6:10–17'>6:10–17</a> The true believer described in chaps. <a ref='Eph 1-3'>1–3</a> , who lives the Spirit-controlled life of <a ref='Ephesians 4:1–6:9'>4:1—6:9</a> , can be sure to be in a spiritual war, as described here. Paul closes this letter with both warning about that war and instructions on how to win it. The Lord provides His saints with sufficient armor to combat and thwart the adversary. In vv. <a ref='Ephesians 6:10–13'>10–13</a> , the apostle briefly sets forth the basic truths regarding the believer’s necessary spiritual preparation as well as truths regarding his enemy, his battle, and his victory. In vv. <a ref='Ephesians 6:14–17'>14–17</a> , he specifies the 6 most necessary pieces of spiritual armor with which God equips His children to resist and overcome Satan’s assaults. <a ref='Ephesians 6:10'>6:10</a> <b>be strong in the Lord and in the might of His strength.</b> Cf. <a ref='Philippians 4:13'>Php 4:13</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 2:1'>2Ti 2:1</a> . Ultimately, Satan’s power over Christians is already broken, and the great war is won through Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection, which forever conquered the power of sin and death ( <a ref='Romans 5:18–21'>Ro 5:18–21</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:56–57'>1Co 15:56–57</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 2:14'>Heb 2:14</a> ). However, in life on earth, battles of temptation go on regularly. The Lord’s power, the strength of His Spirit, and the force of biblical truth are required for victory ( <i>see notes on <a ref='2 Corinthians 10:3–5'>2Co 10:3–5</a></i> ). <a ref='Ephesians 6:11'>6:11</a> <b>Put on the full armor of God.</b> “Put on” conveys the idea of permanence, indicating that armor should be the Christian’s sustained, life-long attire. Paul uses the common armor worn by Roman soldiers as the analogy for the believer’s spiritual defense and affirms its necessity if one is to hold his position while under attack. <b>schemes.</b> This Greek word carries the idea of cleverness, crafty methods, cunning, and deception. Satan’s schemes are propagated through the evil world system over which he rules, and are carried out by his demon hosts. “Schemes” is all-inclusive, encompassing every sin, immoral practice, false theology, false religion, and worldly enticement. <i>See note on <a ref='2 Corinthians 2:11'>2Co 2:11</a> .</i> <b>the devil.</b> Scripture refers to him as “the anointed cherub” ( <a ref='Ezekiel 28:14'>Eze 28:14</a> ), “the ruler of the demons” ( <a ref='Luke 11:15'>Lk 11:15</a> ), “the god of this age” ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:4'>2Co 4:4</a> ), and “the ruler of the power of the air” ( <a ref='Ephesians 2:2'>Eph 2:2</a> ). Scripture depicts him opposing God’s work ( <a ref='Zechariah 3:1'>Zec 3:1</a> ), perverting God’s Word ( <a ref='Matthew 4:6'>Mt 4:6</a> ), hindering God’s servant ( <a ref='1 Thessalonians 2:18'>1Th 2:18</a> ), hindering the gospel ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:4'>2Co 4:4</a> ), snaring the righteous ( <a ref='1 Timothy 3:7'>1Ti 3:7</a> ), and holding the world in his power ( <a ref='1 John 5:19'>1Jn 5:19</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 6:12'>6:12</a> <b>struggle.</b> A term used of hand-to-hand combat, rendered as “wrestle” by some translations. Struggling or wrestling features trickery and deception, like Satan and his hosts when they attack. Coping with deceptive temptation requires truth and righteousness. The 4 designations describe the different strata and rankings of those demons and the evil supernatural empire in which they operate. Satan’s forces of darkness are highly structured for the most destructive purposes. Cf. <a ref='Colossians 2:15'>Col 2:15</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 3:22'>1Pe 3:22</a> . <b>not against flesh and blood.</b> See <a ref='2 Corinthians 10:3–5'>2Co 10:3–5</a> . <b>spiritual</b> forces <b>of wickedness.</b> This possibly refers to the most depraved abominations, including such things as extreme sexual perversions, occultism, and Satan worship. <i>See note on <a ref='Colossians 1:16'>Col 1:16</a> .</i> <b>in the heavenly</b> places. As in <a ref='Ephesians 1:3'>1:3</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 3:10'>3:10</a> , this refers to the entire realm of spiritual beings. <a ref='Ephesians 6:13'>6:13</a> <b>Therefore, take up the full armor of God.</b> Paul again emphasized the necessity of the Christian’s appropriating God’s full spiritual armor by obedience in taking it up, or putting it on (v. <a ref='Ephesians 6:11'>11</a> ). The first 3 pieces of armor (girdle, breastplate, and shoes/boots, vv. <a ref='Ephesians 6:14–15'>14–15</a> ) were worn continually on the battlefield; the last 3 (shield, helmet, and sword, vv. <a ref='Ephesians 6:16–17'>16–17</a> ) were kept ready for use when actual fighting began. <b>the evil day.</b> Since the fall of man, every day has been evil, a condition that will persist until the Lord returns and establishes His own righteous kingdom on earth. <b>having done everything, to stand firm.</b> Standing firm against the enemy without wavering or falling is the goal. <i>See notes on <a ref='James 4:17'>Jas 4:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 5:8–9'>1Pe 5:8–9</a> .</i> <a ref='Ephesians 6:14'>6:14</a> <b>Stand firm therefore.</b> For the third time (see vv. <a ref='Ephesians 6:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Ephesians 6:13'>13</a> ), the apostle calls Christians to take a firm position in the spiritual battle against Satan and his minions. Whether confronting Satan’s efforts to distrust God, forsaking obedience, producing doctrinal confusion and falsehood, hindering service to God, bringing division, serving God in the flesh, living hypocritically, being worldly, or in any other way rejecting biblical obedience, this armor is our defense. girded … with truth <b>.</b> The soldier wore a tunic of loose-fitting cloth. Since ancient combat was largely hand-to-hand, a loose tunic was a potential hindrance and danger. A belt was necessary to cinch up the loosely hanging material. Cf. <a ref='Exodus 12:11'>Ex 12:11</a> ; <a ref='Luke 12:35'>Lk 12:35</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:13'>1Pe 1:13</a> . Girding up was a matter of pulling in the loose ends as preparation for battle. The belt that pulls all the spiritual loose ends in is “truth,” or better, “truthfulness.” The idea is of sincere commitment to fight and win without hypocrisy—self-discipline in devotion to victory. Everything that hinders is tucked away. Cf. <a ref='2 Timothy 2:4'>2Ti 2:4</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 12:1'>Heb 12:1</a> . the breastplate of righteousness <b>.</b> The breastplate was usually a tough, sleeveless piece of leather or heavy material with animal horn or hoof pieces sewn on, covering the soldier’s full torso, protecting his heart and other vital organs. Because righteousness, or holiness, is such a distinctive characteristic of God Himself, it is not hard to understand why that is the Christian’s chief protection against Satan and his schemes. As believers faithfully live in obedience to and communion with Jesus Christ, His own righteousness produces in them the practical, daily righteousness that becomes their spiritual breastplate. Lack of holiness, on the other hand, leaves them vulnerable to the great enemy of their souls (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 59:17'>Is 59:17</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 7:1'>2Co 7:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:8'>1Th 5:8</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 6:15'>6:15</a> <b>shod …</b> with … the gospel of peace <b>.</b> Roman soldiers wore boots with nails in them to grip the ground in combat. The gospel of peace pertains to the good news that, through Christ, believers are at peace with God and He is on their side ( <a ref='Romans 5:6–10'>Ro 5:6–10</a> ). It is that confidence of divine support which allows the believer to stand firm, knowing that since he is at peace with God, God is his strength (see <a ref='Romans 8:31'>Ro 8:31</a> , <a ref='Romans 8:37–39'>37–39</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 6:16'>6:16</a> <b>the shield of faith.</b> This Greek word usually refers to the large shield (2.5 x 4.5 ft.) that protected the entire body. The faith to which Paul refers is not the body of Christian doctrine (as the term is used in <a ref='Ephesians 4:13'>4:13</a> ), but basic trust in God. The believer’s continual trust in God’s word and promise is “in addition to all” necessary to protect him from temptations to every sort of sin. All sin comes when the victim falls to Satan’s lies and promises of pleasure, rejecting the better choice of obedience and blessing. <b>flaming arrows.</b> Temptations are likened to the flaming arrows shot by the enemy and quenched by the oil-treated leather shield (cf. <a ref='Psalms 18:30'>Ps 18:30</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 30:5–6'>Pr 30:5–6</a> ; <a ref='1 John 5:4'>1Jn 5:4</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 6:17'>6:17</a> the helmet of salvation <b>.</b> The helmet protected the head, always a major target in battle. Paul is speaking to those who are already saved, and is therefore not speaking here about attaining salvation. Rather, Satan seeks to destroy a believer’s assurance of salvation with his weapons of doubt and discouragement. This is clear from Paul’s reference to the helmet as “the hope of salvation” ( <a ref='Isaiah 59:17'>Is 59:17</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:8'>1Th 5:8</a></i> ). But although a Christian’s feelings about his salvation may be seriously damaged by Satan-inspired doubt, his salvation itself is eternally protected and he need not fear its loss. Satan wants to curse the believer with doubts, but the Christian can be strong in God’s promises of eternal salvation in Scripture (see <a ref='John 6:37–39'>Jn 6:37–39</a> ; <a ref='John 10:28–29'>10:28–29</a> ; <a ref='Romans 5:10'>Ro 5:10</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:31–39'>8:31–39</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 1:6'>Php 1:6</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:3–5'>1Pe 1:3–5</a> ). Security is a fact; assurance is a feeling that comes to the obedient Christian ( <a ref='1 Peter 1:3–10'>1Pe 1:3–10</a> ). <b>the sword of the Spirit.</b> As the sword was the soldier’s only weapon, so God’s Word is the only needed weapon, infinitely more powerful than any of Satan’s. The Greek term refers to a small weapon (6–18 in. long). It was used both defensively to fend off Satan’s attacks, and offensively to help destroy the enemy’s strategies. It is the truth of Scripture. <i>See notes on <a ref='2 Corinthians 10:3–5'>2Co 10:3–5</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 4:12'>Heb 4:12</a> .</i> <a ref='Ephesians 6:18'>6:18</a> This verse introduces the general character of a believer’s prayer life: 1) “all prayer and petition” focuses on the variety; 2) “at all times” focuses on the frequency (cf. <a ref='Romans 12:12'>Ro 12:12</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 4:6'>Php 4:6</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:17'>1Th 5:17</a> ); 3) “in the Spirit” focuses on submission, as we line up with the will of God (cf. <a ref='Romans 8:26–27'>Ro 8:26–27</a> ); 4) “being on the alert” focuses on the manner (cf. <a ref='Matthew 26:41'>Mt 26:41</a> ; <a ref='Mark 13:33'>Mk 13:33</a> ); 5) “all perseverance” focuses on the persistence (cf. <a ref='Luke 11:9'>Lk 11:9</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:7–8'>18:7–8</a> ); and 6) “all the saints” focuses on the objects (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 12:23'>1Sa 12:23</a> ). <a ref='Ephesians 6:19–20'>6:19–20</a> Paul does not ask for prayer for his personal well-being or physical comfort in the imprisonment from which he wrote, but for boldness and faithfulness to continue proclaiming the gospel to the unsaved no matter what the cost. <b>mystery.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Ephesians 3:4'>3:4</a> .</i> <b>ambassador.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:18–20'>2Co 5:18–20</a> .</i> <a ref='Ephesians 6:21–22'>6:21–22</a> <b>Tychicus.</b> A convert from Asia Minor (modern Turkey) who was with the apostle during his first imprisonment in Rome, from where this epistle was written (see <a ref='Ephesians 3:1'>3:1</a> ).
