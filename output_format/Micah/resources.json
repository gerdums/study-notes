    "content": "The Book of Micah Title The name of the book is derived from the prophet who, having received the word of the Lord, was commissioned to proclaim it. Micah, whose name is shared by others in the OT (e.g., <a ref='Judges 17:1'>Jdg 17:1</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 13:2'>2Chr 13:2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 36:11'>Jer 36:11</a> ), is a shortened form of Micaiah (or Michaiah) and means “Who is like the Lord?” In <a ref='Micah 7:18'>7:18</a> , Micah uses a play on his own name, saying “Who is a God like You?” Author and Date The first verse establishes Micah as the author. Beyond that, little is known about him. His parentage is not given, but his name suggests a godly heritage. He traces his roots to the town of Moresheth ( <a ref='Micah 1:1'>1:1</a> , <a ref='Micah 1:14'>14</a> ), located in the foothills of Judah, approximately 25 mi. southwest of Jerusalem, on the border of Judah and Philistia, near Gath. From a productive agricultural area, he was like Amos, a country resident removed from the national politics and religion, yet chosen by God ( <a ref='Micah 3:8'>3:8</a> ) to deliver a message of judgment to the princes and people of Jerusalem. Micah places his prophecy during the reigns of Jotham (750–731 BC), Ahaz (731–715 BC), and Hezekiah (715–686 BC). His indictments of social injustices and religious corruption renew the theme of Amos (mid-eighth century BC) and his contemporaries, Hosea in the north (ca. 755–710 BC) and Isaiah in in the south (ca. 739–690 BC). This fits that which is known about the character of Ahaz ( <a ref='2 Kings 16:10–18'>2Ki 16:10–18</a> ) and his son Hezekiah prior to his sweeping spiritual reformations ( <a ref='2Ch 29'>2Chr 29</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 31:1'>31:1</a> ). His references to the imminent fall of Samaria ( <a ref='Micah 1:6'>1:6</a> ) clearly position him before 722 BC, at approximately 735–710 BC. Background and Setting Because the northern kingdom was about to fall to Assyria during Micah’s ministry in 722 BC, Micah dates his message with the mention of Judean kings only. While Israel was an occasional recipient of his words (cf. <a ref='Micah 1:5–7'>1:5–7</a> ), his primary attention was directed toward the southern kingdom in which he lived. The economic prosperity and the absence of international crises which marked the days of Jeroboam II (793–753 BC), during which the borders of Judah and Israel rivaled those of David and Solomon (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 14:23–27'>2Ki 14:23–27</a> ), were slipping away. Syria and Israel invaded Judah, taking the wicked Ahaz temporarily captive (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 28:5–16'>2Chr 28:5–16</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 7:1–2'>Is 7:1–2</a> ). After Assyria had overthrown Syria and Israel, the good king Hezekiah withdrew his allegiance to Assyria, causing Sennacherib to besiege Jerusalem in 701 BC (cf. <a ref='2Ki 18-19'>2Ki 18–19</a> ; <a ref='2Ch 32'>2Chr 32</a> ). The Lord then sent His angel to deliver Judah ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 32:21'>2Chr 32:21</a> ). Hezekiah was used by God to lead Judah back to true worship. After the prosperous reign of Uzziah, who died in 739 BC, his son Jotham continued the same policies, but failed to remove the centers of idolatry. Outward prosperity was only a facade masking rampant social corruption and religious syncretism. Worship of the Canaanite fertility god Baal was increasingly integrated with the OT sacrificial system, reaching epidemic proportions under the reign of Ahaz (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 28:1–4'>2Chr 28:1–4</a> ). When Samaria fell, thousands of refugees swarmed into Judah, bringing their religious syncretism with them. But while Micah (like Hosea) addressed this issue, it was the disintegration of personal and social values to which he delivered his most stinging rebukes and stern warnings (e.g., <a ref='Micah 7:5–6'>7:5–6</a> ). Assyria was the dominant power and a constant threat to Judah, so Micah’s prediction that Babylon, then under Assyrian rule, would conquer Judah ( <a ref='Micah 4:10'>4:10</a> ) seemed remote. Thus, as the prophet Amos was to Israel, Micah was to Judah. Historical and Theological Themes Primarily, Micah proclaimed a message of judgment to a people persistently pursuing evil. Similar to other prophets (cf. <a ref='Hosea 4:1'>Hos 4:1</a> ; <a ref='Amos 3:1'>Am 3:1</a> ), Micah presented his message in lawsuit/courtroom terminology ( <a ref='Micah 1:2'>1:2</a> ; <a ref='Micah 6:1–2'>6:1–2</a> ). The prophecy is arranged in 3 oracles or cycles, each beginning with the admonition to “hear” or “listen” ( <a ref='Micah 1:2'>1:2</a> ; <a ref='Micah 3:1'>3:1</a> ; <a ref='Micah 6:1'>6:1</a> ). Within each oracle, he moves from doom to hope—doom because they have broken God’s law given at Sinai; hope because of God’s unchanging covenant with their forefathers ( <a ref='Micah 7:20'>7:20</a> ). One-third of the book targets the sins of his people; another third looks at the punishment of God to come; and another third promises hope for the faithful after the judgment. Thus, the theme of the inevitability of divine judgment for sin is coupled together with God’s immutable commitment to His covenant promises. The combination of God’s 1) absolute consistency in judging sin and 2) unbending commitment to His covenant through the remnant of His people provides the hearers with a clear disclosure of the character of the Sovereign of the universe. Through divine intervention, He will bring about both judgment on sinners and blessing on those who repent. Interpretive Challenges The verbal similarity between <a ref='Micah 4:1–3'>Mic 4:1–3</a> and <a ref='Isaiah 2:2–4'>Is 2:2–4</a> raises the question of who quoted whom. Interpreters are divided, with no clear-cut answers on either side. Because the two prophets lived in close proximity to each other, prophesying during the same period, this similarity is understandable. God gave the same message through two preachers. The introductory phrase, “in the last days” ( <a ref='Micah 4:1'>4:1</a> ), removes these verses from any post-Exilic fulfillment and requires an eschatological timeframe surrounding the Second Advent of Christ and the beginning of the Millennium. Apart from <a ref='Isaiah 2:2–4'>Is 2:2–4</a> , three other passages from Micah are quoted elsewhere in Scripture. <a ref='Micah 3:12'>Micah 3:12</a> is quoted in <a ref='Jeremiah 26:18'>Jer 26:18</a> , thereby saving Jeremiah’s life from King Jehoiakim’s death sentence. <a ref='Micah 5:2'>Micah 5:2</a> is quoted by the chief priests and scribes ( <a ref='Matthew 2:6'>Mt 2:6</a> ) in response to Herod’s query about the birthplace of the Messiah. <a ref='Micah 7:6'>Micah 7:6</a> is employed by Jesus in <a ref='Matthew 10:35–36'>Mt 10:35–36</a> when commissioning His disciples.

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Micah 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>Moresheth.</b> Located southwest of Jerusalem, near the Philistine city of Gath (cf. <a ref='Micah 1:14'>1:14</a> ). <a ref='Micah 1:2–7'>1:2–7</a> The prophet summons all the nations (v. <a ref='Micah 1:2'>2</a> ) of the world into court to hear charges against Samaria and Judah (vv. <a ref='Micah 1:5–7'>5–7</a> ; cf. <a ref='Isaiah 3:13–14'>Is 3:13–14</a> ). Their destruction was to be a warning example to the nations, prefiguring God’s judgment on all who sin against Him. As an omnipotent Conqueror, the Sovereign over all creation is assured of victory (vv. <a ref='Micah 1:3–4'>3–4</a> ). <a ref='Micah 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>His holy temple.</b> Context points to God’s heavenly throne (cf. <a ref='Psalms 11:4'>Ps 11:4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 6:1'>Is 6:1</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 6:4'>4</a> ). <a ref='Micah 1:3–4'>1:3–4</a> <b>high places … mountains.</b> These could refer to key military positions, so crucial to Israel’s defense, or to the pagan places of worship in the land (cf. v. <a ref='Micah 1:5'>5</a> ). When fortifications disappeared like melted wax, people were gripped by the terrifying reality that they were to answer to the Judge of all the earth ( <a ref='Genesis 18:25'>Ge 18:25</a> ; <a ref='Amos 4:12–13'>Am 4:12–13</a> ). <a ref='Micah 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>Yahweh is going … down.</b> A warning of impending divine judgment by One who sits in the ultimate High Place. <a ref='Micah 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>Samaria … Jerusalem.</b> The two capitals of Israel and Judah, here representative of their respective nations. <a ref='Micah 1:6–7'>1:6–7</a> Yahweh spoke directly of the fall of Samaria at the hands of the Assyrians (ca. 722 BC). <a ref='Micah 1:7'>1:7</a> <b>a harlot’s earnings.</b> Centers of idolatry were financed primarily through payments of money, food, and clothing (cf. <a ref='Genesis 38:17–18'>Ge 38:17–18</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 16:10–11'>Eze 16:10–11</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 2:8–9'>Hos 2:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 3:1'>3:1</a> ) to cultic prostitutes, who were strictly forbidden in Israel ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:17–18'>Dt 23:17–18</a> ). Precious gold and silver, taken from Israel’s temples, was used by the Assyrian invaders for their own idol worship. <a ref='Micah 1:8–16'>1:8–16</a> The judgment was so grave that even the prophet lamented as he traced the enemy’s irreversible (v. <a ref='Micah 1:9'>9</a> ) invasion. <a ref='Micah 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>the gate of my people.</b> Assyria, under Sennacherib, came close to toppling Judah in 701 BC (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 18:13–27'>2Ki 18:13–27</a> ). It is best to see “my” in reference to Micah, not God, contra. some translations. <a ref='Micah 1:10–15'>1:10–15</a> Eleven towns west of Jerusalem are mentioned, some with a play on words. <a ref='Micah 1:10'>1:10</a> <b>Tell it not in Gath.</b> Reflective of David’s dirge at Saul’s death (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 1:20'>2Sa 1:20</a> ), Micah admonished them not to tell the Philistines, lest they would be glad and rejoice. Micah, because of the location of his upbringing, knew how they would react. <a ref='Micah 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>Zaanan does not go out.</b> These inhabitants, in danger and fear, would not go out to console their neighbors who had been overrun. <a ref='Micah 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>calamity has come down.</b> This points to Yahweh as the source of judgment (cf. vv. <a ref='Micah 1:3–4'>3–4</a> ). <a ref='Micah 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>Lachish … sin to the daughter of Zion.</b> Located southwest of Jerusalem, Lachish was a key military fortress whose “sin” was dependence on military might. <a ref='Micah 1:14'>1:14</a> <b>give parting gifts.</b> As parting gifts were given to brides (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 9:16'>1Ki 9:16</a> ), this was a symbol of the departure of Moresheth-gath into captivity. <a ref='Micah 1:15'>1:15</a> <b>glory of Israel … Adullam.</b> The people of Israel (i.e., her “glory”; cf. <a ref='Hosea 9:11–13'>Hos 9:11–13</a> ) were to flee to the caves, as David did to the cave at Adullam ( <a ref='2 Samuel 23:13'>2Sa 23:13</a> ). <a ref='Micah 1:16'>1:16</a> <b>Make yourself bald.</b> Priests were forbidden to make themselves bald ( <a ref='Leviticus 21:5'>Lv 21:5</a> ), nor were the people to imitate the heathen practice of doing so ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 14:1'>Dt 14:1</a> ). But here it would be acceptable as a sign of deep mourning ( <a ref='Ezra 9:3'>Ezr 9:3</a> ; <a ref='Job 1:20'>Job 1:20</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 22:12'>Is 22:12</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 7:18'>Eze 7:18</a> ). <a ref='Micah 2:1–11'>2:1–11</a> As chapter <a ref='Mic 1'>1</a> denounced sin against God; chapter <a ref='Mic 2'>2</a> denounces sin against man. In vv. <a ref='Micah 2:1–5'>1–5</a> , Micah decried the corrupt practices of the affluent; in vv. <a ref='Micah 2:6–11'>6–11</a> he attacked the false prophets and those who would silence the true prophets. <a ref='Micah 2:1–2'>2:1–2</a> The courtroom scene continues, with the accusations being read against the affluent: they had violated the tenth commandment ( <a ref='Exodus 20:17'>Ex 20:17</a> ; cf. <a ref='Exodus 22:26'>22:26</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 23:4–9'>23:4–9</a> ). The poor, unable to defend themselves, were at the mercy of the wealthy. <a ref='Micah 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>his inheritance.</b> Property in Israel was ultimately to be permanent ( <a ref='Leviticus 25:10'>Lv 25:10</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 25:13'>13</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 36:1–12'>Nu 36:1–12</a> ; cf. <a ref='1Ki 21'>1Ki 21</a> ). <a ref='Micah 2:3–5'>2:3–5</a> As a result of sin, God would allow foreign invaders to divide their land; none of them would have the inheritance apportioned to them. As the rich took from the poor, so God would take back that which He gave as judgment on the nation. <a ref='Micah 2:6–11'>2:6–11</a> False prophets, commanding Micah to cease prophesying, would certainly not prophesy against the people’s evildoing; they would not confront them with the divine standard of holiness. Rather, their false message (v. <a ref='Micah 2:7'>7</a> ) had stopped the mouths of the true prophets and had permitted the rulers to engage in social atrocities (vv. <a ref='Micah 2:8–9'>8–9</a> ), leading the people to destruction (v. <a ref='Micah 2:10'>10</a> ). They didn’t want true prophecies; therefore, they got what they wanted (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 30:10'>Is 30:10</a> ). It is best to understand that Micah speaks in v. <a ref='Micah 2:6'>6</a> and God in vv. <a ref='Micah 2:7–11'>7–11</a> . <a ref='Micah 2:6'>2:6</a> <b>Do not speak.</b> The true prophet was accused of childish babbling, when the real babblers were the false prophets (cf. v. <a ref='Micah 2:11'>11</a> ). <a ref='Micah 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>Spirit of Yahweh.</b> God responded to the evil prophets that their message affirming sin in the nation was inconsistent with the Holy Spirit and His true message to Micah (cf. <a ref='Micah 3:8'>3:8</a> ). God’s words do reward the righteous, but they also rebuke those engaging in evil deeds. <a ref='Micah 2:9'>2:9</a> <b>women of My people.</b> Most likely a reference to widows. <a ref='Micah 2:11'>2:11</a> The people accepted any “prophet” who would tailor his message to their greed, wealth, and prosperity. <a ref='Micah 2:12–13'>2:12–13</a> Messiah will make ready the way, removing the obstacles which might hinder His remnant’s deliverance and return at the Second Advent (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:15–16'>Is 11:15–16</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 52:12'>52:12</a> ). <a ref='Micah 2:12'>2:12</a> <b>remnant.</b> Cf. <a ref='Micah 4:7'>4:7</a> ; <a ref='Micah 5:7–8'>5:7–8</a> ; <a ref='Micah 7:18'>7:18</a> . <i>See note on <a ref='Isaiah 10:20'>Is 10:20</a> .</i> <a ref='Micah 3:1–4'>3:1–4</a> In beginning the second oracle, Micah first addressed Israel’s corrupt rulers, as in <a ref='Micah 2:1–2'>2:1–2</a> , who should be aware of injustice. Yet their conduct toward the poor was like the butchering of animals (vv. <a ref='Micah 3:2–3'>2–3</a> ). Therefore, when judgment came and they cried for help, God didn’t answer (v. <a ref='Micah 3:4'>4</a> ). <a ref='Micah 3:5–7'>3:5–7</a> False prophets (cf. <a ref='Micah 2:6–11'>2:6–11</a> ) also stood guilty before the Judge because they misled the people, prophesying peace when they were fed, but predicting war when they were not (v. <a ref='Micah 3:5'>5</a> ). Like the rulers, they too were motivated by greed. Therefore, having blinded others, they would be struck with blindness and silence (vv. <a ref='Micah 3:6–7'>6–7</a> ). <a ref='Micah 3:8'>3:8</a> Micah, in contrast to the false prophets, spoke by the power of God’s Holy Spirit (cf. <a ref='Micah 2:7'>2:7</a> ). Therefore his message was authoritative and true. <a ref='Micah 3:9–12'>3:9–12</a> All ruling classes are guilty: rulers judged for reward (vv. <a ref='Micah 3:9–11'>9–11a</a> ), priests taught for hire (v. <a ref='Micah 3:11'>11b</a> ), and prophets divined for money (v. <a ref='Micah 3:11'>11c</a> ). All the while, they were self-deceived into thinking Yahweh would give them favor because they identified themselves with Him. Consequently, the nation would be destroyed (fulfilled by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC). <a ref='Micah 3:12'>3:12</a> Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 26:18'>Jer 26:18</a> . <a ref='Micah 4:1–3'>4:1–3</a> Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 2:2–4'>Is 2:2–4</a> . <a ref='Micah 4:1'>4:1</a> In a reversal of <a ref='Micah 3:12'>3:12</a> , Micah shifted from impending judgment to prophecies of the future millennial kingdom (“the last days”) in which Mt. Zion (v. <a ref='Micah 4:2'>2</a> ), the center of Messiah’s coming earthly kingdom, shall be raised both spiritually and physically (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 14:9–10'>Zec 14:9–10</a> ). This discussion continues to <a ref='Micah 5:15'>5:15</a> . <a ref='Micah 4:2'>4:2</a> <b>many nations.</b> People throughout the earth, not just Israel, will come as a spontaneous “stream” (cf. v. <a ref='Micah 4:1'>1</a> ) to worship Yahweh in Jerusalem during the Millennium (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 8:20–23'>Zec 8:20–23</a> ). <a ref='Micah 4:3'>4:3</a> <b>hammer their swords into plowshares.</b> Because the Almighty One is ruling in Jerusalem with a rod of iron (cf. <a ref='Revelation 2:27'>Rev 2:27</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:5'>12:5</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:15'>19:15</a> ), and because of the unprecedented fruitfulness of the land (cf. <a ref='Amos 9:13'>Am 9:13</a> ), military hardware will no longer be needed. <a ref='Micah 4:4'>4:4</a> <b>under his vine … fig tree.</b> Once employed as a description of the peaceful era of Solomon (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 4:25'>1Ki 4:25</a> ), this phrase looks forward to greater peace and prosperity in the Millennium (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 3:10'>Zec 3:10</a> ). <a ref='Micah 4:5'>4:5</a> Even if all others were walking after other gods at the present, the godly remnant of Israel would no longer pursue other gods but would walk after the true God in the millennial kingdom (cf. <a ref='Joshua 24:15'>Jos 24:15</a> ). <a ref='Micah 4:6–8'>4:6–8</a> Micah continued to describe the wonderful conditions of the coming earthly kingdom of Messiah. Repeating the figure of sheep (cf. <a ref='Micah 2:12–13'>2:12–13</a> ), the “tower of the flock” depicted the city of Jerusalem, the future dwelling place of Messiah, as watching over the people. <a ref='Micah 4:7'>4:7</a> <b>forever.</b> The Hebrew term does not always mean “without end,” but signifies a long, indefinite period of time, the length of which is always determined by the context. Here it refers to the 1,000-year reign of Messiah on earth (cf. <a ref='Rev 20'>Rev 20</a> ). <a ref='Micah 4:9–10'>4:9–10</a> Judah will be taken captive to Babylon (vv. <a ref='Micah 4:9–10'>9–10a</a> ), but Yahweh will release them from there (v. <a ref='Micah 4:10'>10b</a> ), by the edict of Persian king Cyrus (ca. 538 BC), allowing them to return to Jerusalem (cf. <a ref='Ezra 1:2–4'>Ezr 1:2–4</a> ). <a ref='Micah 4:11–13'>4:11–13</a> Micah switched again to the time of the Second Advent. The gathering of “many nations” and “many peoples” depicts that future battle of Armageddon ( <a ref='Zec 12'>Zec 12</a> ; <a ref='Zec 14'>14</a> ). In that day, Yahweh will empower His people (cf. <a ref='Micah 5:7–9'>5:7–9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:14'>Is 11:14</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:14'>Zec 14:14</a> ). <a ref='Micah 4:13'>4:13</a> <b>horn … iron … hoofs … bronze.</b> Using the figurative language of an animal with metal features, Yahweh looked to a day when Israel will permanently defeat their enemies. <a ref='Micah 5:1'>5:1</a> <b>strike the judge of Israel.</b> A reference to the capture of King Zedekiah at the hands of Babylon in 586 BC (cf. <a ref='2Ki 24-25'>2Ki 24–25</a> ). <a ref='Micah 5:2–4'>5:2–4</a> This passage looked forward to Christ’s First Advent ( <a ref='Micah 5:2'>5:2</a> ), an intervening time ( <a ref='Micah 5:3'>5:3a</a> ), and beyond to the Second Advent ( <a ref='Micah 5:3–4'>5:3b–4</a> ). <a ref='Micah 5:2'>5:2</a> <b>Bethlehem Ephrathah.</b> The town south of Jerusalem which was the birthplace of David and later Jesus Christ ( <a ref='1Sa 16'>1Sa 16</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 2:5'>Mt 2:5</a> ; <a ref='Luke 2:4–7'>Lk 2:4–7</a> ). The name Bethlehem means “house of bread” because the area was a grain-producing region in OT times. The name Ephrathah (“fruitful”) differentiates it from the Galilean town by the same name. The town, known for her many vineyards and olive orchards, was small in size but not in honor. <b>from everlasting, From the ancient days.</b> This speaks of eternal God’s incarnation in the person of Jesus Christ. It points to His millennial reign as King of kings (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 9:6'>Is 9:6</a> ). <a ref='Micah 5:3'>5:3</a> <b>give them</b> up <b>.</b> A reference to the interval between Messiah’s rejection at His First Advent and His Second Advent, during the times of the Gentiles when Israel rejects Christ and is under the domination of enemies. Regathering of the “remainder of His brothers” did not occur at the First Advent but is slated for the Second Advent (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 10:20–22'>Is 10:20–22</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:11–16'>11:11–16</a> ). Nor can “return” speak of Gentiles, since it cannot be said that they “returned” to Yahweh. Rather, the context of <a ref='Micah 5:3–4'>5:3–4</a> is millennial and cannot be made to fit the First Advent. Thus, “she who is in childbirth” must denote the nation of Israel (cf. <a ref='Revelation 12:1–6'>Rev 12:1–6</a> ). <a ref='Micah 5:4'>5:4</a> The millennial rule of Christ, sitting upon the throne of David (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 6:13'>Is 6:13</a> ). <a ref='Micah 5:5–6'>5:5–6</a> <b>Assyrian.</b> Assyria, God’s instrument against Israel (722 BC) and Judah (Sennacherib’s siege in 701 BC) is here used as a representative of enemy nations in opposition to Yahweh. <a ref='Micah 5:5'>5:5</a> <b>Seven … eight.</b> An idiom for a full and sufficient number of leaders, more than enough for the task (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 11:2'>Ecc 11:2</a> ). <a ref='Micah 5:6'>5:6</a> <b>Nimrod.</b> A reference to Assyria (cf. <a ref='Genesis 10:11'>Ge 10:11</a> ) that could possibly also include Babylon (cf. <a ref='Genesis 10:10'>Ge 10:10</a> ). <a ref='Micah 5:7–9'>5:7–9</a> Israel’s presence in the midst of many peoples would be to some a source of blessing (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 8:22–23'>Zec 8:22–23</a> ); to others, she would be like a lion—a source of fear and destruction (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:14'>Is 11:14</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 12:2–3'>Zec 12:2–3</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 12:6'>6</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:14'>14:14</a> ). <a ref='Micah 5:9'>5:9</a> <b>all your enemies.</b> This absolute and complete peace has never yet been experienced by Israel. This points to the millennial kingdom when the Prince of Peace shall reign, having conquered the nations (cf. v. <a ref='Micah 5:15'>15</a> ). <a ref='Micah 5:10'>5:10</a> <b>in that day.</b> The future kingdom is in view. Israel had been forbidden the use of cavalry ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:16'>Dt 17:16</a> ), lest they trust in earthly forces, rather than God ( <a ref='1 Kings 10:26'>1Ki 10:26</a> , <a ref='1 Kings 10:28'>28</a> ). God will remove all implements in which they trust so the people, stripped of all human resources, rest only on Him. War instruments will have no place in that time of peace. <a ref='Micah 5:11–14'>5:11–14</a> <b>cut off the cities … fortifications.</b> Continuing the thought from v. <a ref='Micah 5:10'>10</a> , fortified cities were designed for defense; their strength tempted people to put their trust in them rather than in God alone (cf. <a ref='Micah 1:13'>1:13</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 27:1'>Ps 27:1</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 10:13–14'>Hos 10:13–14</a> ). People will live in peace in unwalled villages ( <a ref='Ezekiel 38:11'>Eze 38:11</a> ). The cities are also associated with centers of pagan worship (v. <a ref='Micah 5:14'>14</a> ; cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:21'>Dt 16:21</a> ), the worship of Asherah (Canaanite goddess of fertility and war). All forms of self-reliance in war and idolatrous worship will be removed so that the nation must rely solely on Christ their King for deliverance and worship Him alone. <a ref='Micah 6:1'>6:1</a> Micah opens this third cycle of oracles ( <a ref='Micah 6:1–7:20'>6:1—7:20</a> ) with a dramatic courtroom motif moving back and forth between 3 speakers: Yahweh pleading His case, the people responding under conviction, and the prophet as the lawyer for the plaintiff. <a ref='Micah 6:1–2'>6:1–2</a> Yahweh commanded Micah (v. <a ref='Micah 6:1'>1</a> ), as His advocate, to plead His case before the mountains and hills, which were to act as witnesses against His people (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:25–26'>Dt 4:25–26</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 1:2'>Is 1:2</a> ). The mountains and hills were present at Sinai when Yahweh made His covenant with Israel and when the Ten Commandments were written and placed in the ark of the covenant as a permanent witness (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:26'>Dt 31:26</a> ). <a ref='Micah 6:3–5'>6:3–5</a> This was Yahweh’s appeal. With tenderness and emotion, the divine Plaintiff recalled His many gracious acts toward them, almost to the point of assuming the tone of a defendant. Noting their trek from bondage in Egypt to their own homeland, God had provided leadership (v. <a ref='Micah 6:4'>4</a> ), reversed the attempts of Balaam to curse the people (v. <a ref='Micah 6:5'>5a</a> ; cf. <a ref='Nu 22-24'>Nu 22–24</a> ), and miraculously parted the Jordan River (v. <a ref='Micah 6:5'>5b</a> ) so they could cross over from Shittim, located east of the Jordan, to Gilgal on the west side near Jericho. God had faithfully kept all His promises to them. <a ref='Micah 6:6–7'>6:6–7</a> Micah, as though speaking on behalf of the people, asked rhetorically how, in light of God’s faithfulness toward them, they could continue their hypocrisy by being outwardly religious but inwardly sinful. <a ref='Micah 6:8'>6:8</a> Micah’s terse response (v. <a ref='Micah 6:8'>8</a> ) indicated they should have known the answer to the rhetorical question. Spiritual blindness had led them to offer everything except the one thing He wanted—a spiritual commitment of the heart from which right behavior would ensue (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:12–19'>Dt 10:12–19</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 22:37–39'>Mt 22:37–39</a> ). This theme is often represented in the OT (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 15:22'>1Sa 15:22</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 1:11–20'>Is 1:11–20</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 7:21–23'>Jer 7:21–23</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 6:6'>Hos 6:6</a> ; <a ref='Amos 5:15'>Am 5:15</a> ). <a ref='Micah 6:9–16'>6:9–16</a> Yahweh was sending judgment; God Himself had appointed the time and instrument to punish His people. Yahweh spoke, noting that their corrupt deeds perpetrated on the poor were still continuing, in spite of His warnings and discipline (vv. <a ref='Micah 6:10–12'>10–12</a> ). Therefore, a severe judgment was coming (vv. <a ref='Micah 6:13–15'>13–15</a> ); it would happen to them just as it did to their northern neighbor, Israel (v. <a ref='Micah 6:16'>16</a> ), when led by the counsel of wicked kings. <a ref='Micah 6:9'>6:9</a> <b>Hear, O tribe.</b> Listen for the description of the coming punishment (cf. vv. <a ref='Micah 6:13–15'>13–15</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 10:5'>Is 10:5</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 10:24'>24</a> ). <a ref='Micah 6:16'>6:16</a> <b>statutes of Omri.</b> Ca. 885–874 BC. He was the founder of Samaria and of Ahab’s wicked house as well as a supporter of Jeroboam’s superstitions (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 16:16–28'>1Ki 16:16–28</a> ). <b>works of the house of Ahab.</b> Cf. <a ref='1 Kings 21:25–26'>1Ki 21:25–26</a> (ca. 874–853 BC). <a ref='Micah 7:1–6'>7:1–6</a> Micah lamented the circumstances of his day. In his vain search for an upright person (cf. v. <a ref='Micah 7:2'>2</a> ), he compared himself to the vinedresser who enters his vineyard late in the season and finds no fruit. The leaders conspired together to get what they wanted (v. <a ref='Micah 7:3'>3</a> ). No one could be trusted (vv. <a ref='Micah 7:5–6'>5–6</a> ). Christ used v. <a ref='Micah 7:6'>6</a> as an illustration when He commissioned the twelve ( <a ref='Matthew 10:1'>Mt 10:1</a> , <a ref='Matthew 10:35–36'>35–36</a> ). <a ref='Micah 7:1'>7:1</a> <b>Woe is me!</b> Micah sounded like Isaiah (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 6:5'>Is 6:5</a> ). <a ref='Micah 7:7'>7:7</a> In spite of his dire circumstances, Micah, as a watchman (cf. v. <a ref='Micah 7:4'>4</a> ), would intently look for evidence of God’s working, trusting God to act in His own time and way (cf. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:16–19'>Hab 3:16–19</a> ). <a ref='Micah 7:8–10'>7:8–10</a> Israel confessed her faith in Yahweh, warning her enemies that she will rise again (vv. <a ref='Micah 7:8'>8</a> , <a ref='Micah 7:10'>10</a> ). She confessed her sin, acknowledging the justice of God’s punishment and anticipating His restoration. <a ref='Micah 7:10'>7:10</a> <b>Where is Yahweh your God?</b> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 42:3'>Ps 42:3</a> , <a ref='Psalms 42:10'>10</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 27:43'>Mt 27:43</a> . <a ref='Micah 7:11–13'>7:11–13</a> Micah again spoke, recounting the many blessings awaiting the faithful remnant in Messiah’s millennial rule. It would include unprecedented expansion (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 2:1–5'>Zec 2:1–5</a> ) and massive infusion of immigrants (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:15–16'>Is 11:15–16</a> ). For those who defied Messiah’s millennial rulership, their land would become desolate (v. <a ref='Micah 7:13'>13</a> ; cf. <a ref='Zechariah 14:16–19'>Zec 14:16–19</a> ). <a ref='Micah 7:14–17'>7:14–17</a> Micah petitioned Yahweh (v. <a ref='Micah 7:14'>14</a> ) to shepherd, feed, and protect His people like a flock (cf. <a ref='Ps 23'>Ps 23</a> ). Yahweh answered, reiterating that He would demonstrate His presence and power among them as He did in the Exodus from Egypt (v. <a ref='Micah 7:15'>15</a> ). As a result (cf. v. <a ref='Micah 7:10'>10</a> ), the vaunted pride and power of the nations would be rendered powerless (cf. <a ref='Joshua 2:9–11'>Jos 2:9–11</a> ) and, having been humbled (v. <a ref='Micah 7:17'>17</a> ), they would no longer listen to or engage in the taunting of His people (v. <a ref='Micah 7:16'>16b</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 12:3'>Ge 12:3</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 52:15'>Is 52:15</a> ). <a ref='Micah 7:15'>7:15</a> <b>wondrous deeds.</b> These miracles will be fulfilled in God’s judgment on the earth which precedes the Second Advent of Messiah (cf. <a ref='Rev 6-19'>Rev 6–19</a> ). <a ref='Micah 7:18–20'>7:18–20</a> In response to the gracious, forgiving character displayed toward Israel by their Master, the repentant remnant of the people extolled His incomparable grace and mercy (cf. <a ref='Psalms 130:3–4'>Ps 130:3–4</a> ). <a ref='Micah 7:18'>7:18</a> <b>Who is a God like You…?</b> Micah began this final section with a play on words involving his name. See Introduction: Title . God’s Forgiveness of Sin 1. God removes our sins as far as the east is from the west ( <a ref='Psalms 103:12'>Ps 103:12</a> ) 2. God completely cleanses us from the stain of our sins ( <a ref='Isaiah 1:18'>Is 1:18</a> ) 3. God throws our sins behind His back ( <a ref='Isaiah 38:17'>Is 38:17</a> ) 4. God remembers our sins no more ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:34'>Jer 31:34</a> ) 5. God treads our sins underfoot ( <a ref='Micah 7:19'>Mic 7:19</a> ) 6. God casts our sins into the depths of the sea ( <a ref='Micah 7:19'>Mic 7:19</a> ) Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Micah 7:20'>7:20</a> <b>swore to our fathers.</b> In spite of Israel’s unfaithfulness to God, Yahweh intends to fulfill His unconditional promises in the Abrahamic Covenant made with Abraham and confirmed with Isaac and Jacob (cf. <a ref='Ge 12'>Ge 12</a> , <a ref='Ge 15'>15</a> , <a ref='Ge 17'>17</a> , <a ref='Ge 22'>22</a> , <a ref='Ge 26'>26</a> , <a ref='Ge 28'>28</a> , <a ref='Ge 35'>35</a> ). When enacted in conjunction with the Davidic Covenant, Israel will again be restored as a people and a nation to the land originally promised to Abraham.
