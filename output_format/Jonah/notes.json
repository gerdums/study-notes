While other prophets prophesied against Gentile nations, this is the only case of a prophet actually being sent to a foreign nation to deliver God’s message against them. This was for the salvation of that city and for the shame and jealousy of Israel, as well as a rebuke to the reluctance of the Jews to bring Gentiles to the true God. Nineveh, which dates back to Nimrod ( Ge 10:11 ), was located on the banks of the Tigris River approximately 500 mi. northeast of Israel. It was always one of Assyria’s royal cities and for many years served as the capital. The name Nineveh is thought to derive from “ninus,” i.e., Nimrod, and means the residence of Nimrod or “nunu” (Akkadian for “fish”). The people worshiped the fish goddess Nanshe (the daughter of Ea, the goddess of fresh water) and Dagon the fish god who was represented as half man and half fish. the great city. Nineveh was great both in size ( 3:3 ) and in power, exerting significant influence over the Middle East until her destruction by Nebuchadnezzar in 612 BC. It was possibly the largest city in the world at this time. According to historians, magnificent walls almost 8 mi. long enveloped the inner city, with the rest of the city/district occupying an area with a circumference of some 60 miles. Its population could have approached 600,000 (cf. 4:11 ). their evil has come up before Me. Nineveh was the center of idolatrous worship of Assur and Ishtar. A century later, Nahum pronounced doom upon Assyria for her evil ways and cruelty ( Na 3 ), which was carried out by Nebuchadnezzar in 612 BC."

Spoken to sailors who were most likely from Phoenicia, the center of Baal worship, the title bears significant weight, especially when coupled with the phrase “who made the sea and the dry land.” This was the appropriate identification when introducing the true and living God to pagans who didn’t have Scripture, but whose reason led them to recognize the fact that there had to be a Creator (cf. Ro 1:18–23 ). To begin with creation, as in Ac 14:14–17 and 17:23b–29 , was the proper starting point. To evangelize Jews, one can begin with the OT Scripture."
