These titles summarized the divine blessings which such a nation would experience: belonging especially to Yahweh, representing Him in the earth and being set apart unto Him for His purposes. These expanded ethnically and morally what it meant to have brought them to Himself. “For all the earth is Mine,” in the midst of the titles, laid stress upon the uniqueness and sovereignty of Yahweh and had to be understood as dismissing all other claims by so-called other gods of the nations. It was more than the power of one god over another in Israel’s situation; it was the choice and power of the only Lord! See 1Pe 2:9 , where Peter uses these terms in the sense of God’s spiritual kingdom of the redeemed."

Ancient Near Eastern law codes for the most part were casuistic, or case-law, in form, i.e., an “if … then” construction written in the third person wherein a supposed offense was followed by a statement of the action to be taken or penalty to be exacted. The Ten Commandments may also be grouped into two broad categories: the vertical, namely man’s relationship to God (vv. 2–11 ), and the horizontal, namely man’s relationship to the community (vv. 12–17 ). Concisely listed prohibitions mark the second category, with only one exception—an imperative plus its explanation (v. 12 ). Explanation or reason appended to a prohibition marks the first category. By these Ten Commandments, true theology and true worship, the name of God, the Sabbath, family honor, life, marriage, property, truth, and virtue are well protected. See note on 24:7 ."

Each Sabbath day should have reminded the worshiper that the God whom he praised had indeed made everything in both realms of existence in 6 twenty-four-hour days. The Sabbath would also stand, therefore, as a counter to evolutionary ideas prevalent in false religion. Moses, in the review of the Decalogue, also linked the observance of the Sabbath with Israel’s exodus from Egypt and specified that this was why Israel was to keep it ( Dt 5:12–15 ). Significantly, the command for the Sabbath is not repeated in the NT, whereas the other 9 are. In fact, it is nullified (cf. Col 2:16–17 ).
