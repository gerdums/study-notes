    "content": "Proverbs Title The title in the Hebrew Bible is “The Proverbs of Solomon” ( <a ref='Proverbs 1:1'>1:1</a> ), as also in the Greek Septuagint (LXX). Proverbs pulls together the most important 513 of the over 3,000 proverbs pondered by Solomon ( <a ref='1 Kings 4:32'>1Ki 4:32</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:9'>Ecc 12:9</a> ), along with some proverbs of others whom Solomon likely influenced. The word “proverb” means “to be like,” thus Proverbs is a book of comparisons between common, concrete images and life’s most profound truths. Proverbs are simple, moral statements (or illustrations) that highlight and teach fundamental realities about life. Solomon sought God’s wisdom ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 1:8–12'>2Chr 1:8–12</a> ) and offered “pithy sayings” designed to make men contemplate 1) the fear of God and 2) living by His wisdom ( <a ref='Proverbs 1:7'>1:7</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 9:10'>9:10</a> ). The sum of this wisdom is personified in the Lord Jesus Christ ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:30'>1Co 1:30</a> ). Author and Date The phrase “Proverbs of Solomon” is more a title than an absolute statement of authorship ( <a ref='Proverbs 1:1'>1:1</a> ). While King Solomon, who ruled Israel from 971–931 BC and was granted great wisdom by God (see <a ref='1 Kings 4:29–34'>1Ki 4:29–34</a> ), is the author of the didactic section (chaps. <a ref='Pr 1-9'>1–9</a> ) and the proverbs of <a ref='Proverbs 10:1–22:16'>10:1—22:16</a> , he is likely only the compiler of the “sayings of the wise” in <a ref='Proverbs 22:17–24:34'>22:17—24:34</a> , which are of an uncertain date before Solomon’s reign. The collection in chaps. <a ref='Pr 25-29'>25–29</a> was originally composed by Solomon ( <a ref='Proverbs 25:1'>25:1</a> ) but copied and included later by Judah’s king Hezekiah (ca. 715–686 BC). Chapter <a ref='Pr 30'>30</a> reflects the words of Agur and chap. <a ref='Pr 31'>31</a> the words of Lemuel, who perhaps was Solomon. Proverbs was not assembled in its final form until Hezekiah’s day or after. Solomon authored his proverbs before his heart was turned away from God ( <a ref='1 Kings 11:1–11'>1Ki 11:1–11</a> ), since the book reveals a godly perspective and is addressed to the “naive” and “young” who need to learn the fear of God. Solomon also wrote <a ref='Ps 72'>Psalms 72</a> and <a ref='Ps 127'>127</a> , Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. See Introduction: Author and Date for Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs . Background and Setting The book reflects a 3-fold setting as: 1) general wisdom literature; 2) insights from the royal court; and 3) instruction offered in the tender relationship of a father and mother with their children, all designed to produce meditation on God. Since Proverbs is Wisdom literature, by nature it is sometimes difficult to understand ( <a ref='Proverbs 1:6'>1:6</a> ). Wisdom literature is part of the whole of OT truth; the Priest gave the <i>Law</i> , the Prophet gave a <i>Word</i> from the Lord, and the Sage (or wise man) gave his wise <i>Counsel</i> ( <a ref='Jeremiah 18:18'>Jer 18:18</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 7:26'>Eze 7:26</a> ). In Proverbs, Solomon the Sage gives insight into the “knotty” issues of life ( <a ref='Proverbs 1:6'>1:6</a> ) which are not directly addressed in the Law or the Prophets. Though it is practical, Proverbs is not superficial or external because it contains moral and ethical elements stressing upright living which flow out of a right relationship with God. In <a ref='Proverbs 4:1–4'>4:1–4</a> , Solomon connected 3 generations as he entrusted to his son Rehoboam what he learned at the feet of David and Bathsheba. Proverbs is both a pattern for the tender impartation of truth from generation to generation, as well as a vast resource for the content of the truth to be imparted. Proverbs contains the principles and applications of Scripture which the godly characters of the Bible illustrate in their lives. Historical and Theological Themes Solomon came to the throne with great promise, privilege, and opportunity. God had granted his request for understanding ( <a ref='1 Kings 3:9–12'>1Ki 3:9–12</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 1:10–12'>2Chr 1:10–12</a> ), and his wisdom exceeded all others ( <a ref='1 Kings 4:29–31'>1Ki 4:29–31</a> ). However, the shocking reality is that he failed to live out the truth that he knew and even taught his son Rehoboam ( <a ref='1 Kings 11:1'>1Ki 11:1</a> , <a ref='1 Kings 11:4'>4</a> , <a ref='1 Kings 11:6'>6</a> , <a ref='1 Kings 11:7–11'>7–11</a> ), who subsequently rejected his father’s teaching ( <a ref='1 Kings 12:6–11'>1Ki 12:6–11</a> ). Proverbs contains a gold mine of biblical theology, reflecting themes of Scripture brought to the level of practical righteousness ( <a ref='Proverbs 1:3'>1:3</a> ), by addressing man’s ethical choices, calling into question how he thinks, lives, and manages his daily life in light of divine truth. More specifically, Proverbs calls man to live as the Creator intended him to live when He made man ( <a ref='Psalms 90:1–2'>Ps 90:1–2</a> , <a ref='Psalms 90:12'>12</a> ). The recurring promise of Proverbs is that generally the wise (the righteous who obey God) live longer ( <a ref='Proverbs 9:11'>9:11</a> ), prosper ( <a ref='Proverbs 2:20–22'>2:20–22</a> ), experience joy ( <a ref='Proverbs 3:13–18'>3:13–18</a> ) and the goodness of God temporally ( <a ref='Proverbs 12:21'>12:21</a> ), while fools suffer shame ( <a ref='Proverbs 3:35'>3:35</a> ) and death ( <a ref='Proverbs 10:21'>10:21</a> ). On the other hand, it must be remembered that this general principle is balanced by the reality that the wicked sometimes prosper ( <a ref='Psalms 73:3'>Ps 73:3</a> , <a ref='Psalms 73:12'>12</a> ), though only temporarily ( <a ref='Psalms 73:17–19'>Ps 73:17–19</a> ). Job illustrates that there are occasions when the godly wise are struck with disaster and suffering. There are a number of important themes addressed in Proverbs, which are offered in random order and address different topics, so that it is helpful to study the proverbs thematically as illustrated. I. Man’s Relationship to God A. His Trust— <a ref='Proverbs 22:19'>Pr 22:19</a> B. His Humility— <a ref='Proverbs 3:34'>Pr 3:34</a> C. His Fear of God— <a ref='Proverbs 1:7'>Pr 1:7</a> D. His Righteousness— <a ref='Proverbs 10:25'>Pr 10:25</a> E. His Sin— <a ref='Proverbs 28:13'>Pr 28:13</a> F. His Obedience— <a ref='Proverbs 6:23'>Pr 6:23</a> G. Facing Reward— <a ref='Proverbs 12:28'>Pr 12:28</a> H. Facing Tests— <a ref='Proverbs 17:3'>Pr 17:3</a> I. Facing Blessing— <a ref='Proverbs 10:22'>Pr 10:22</a> J. Facing Death— <a ref='Proverbs 15:11'>Pr 15:11</a> II. Man’s Relationship to Himself A. His Character— <a ref='Proverbs 20:11'>Pr 20:11</a> B. His Wisdom— <a ref='Proverbs 1:5'>Pr 1:5</a> C. His Foolishness— <a ref='Proverbs 26:10–11'>Pr 26:10–11</a> D. His Speech— <a ref='Proverbs 18:21'>Pr 18:21</a> E. His Self-Control— <a ref='Proverbs 6:9–11'>Pr 6:9–11</a> F. His Kindness— <a ref='Proverbs 3:3'>Pr 3:3</a> G. His Wealth— <a ref='Proverbs 11:4'>Pr 11:4</a> H. His Pride— <a ref='Proverbs 27:1'>Pr 27:1</a> I. His Anger— <a ref='Proverbs 29:11'>Pr 29:11</a> J. His Laziness— <a ref='Proverbs 13:4'>Pr 13:4</a> III. Man’s Relationship to Others A. His Love— <a ref='Proverbs 8:17'>Pr 8:17</a> B. His Friends— <a ref='Proverbs 17:17'>Pr 17:17</a> C. His Enemies— <a ref='Proverbs 16:7'>Pr 16:7</a> D. His Truthfulness— <a ref='Proverbs 23:23'>Pr 23:23</a> E. His Gossip— <a ref='Proverbs 20:19'>Pr 20:19</a> F. As a Father— <a ref='Proverbs 20:7'>Pr 20:7</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 31:2–9'>31:2–9</a> G. As a Mother— <a ref='Proverbs 31:10–31'>Pr 31:10–31</a> H. As Children— <a ref='Proverbs 3:1–3'>Pr 3:1–3</a> I. In Educating Children— <a ref='Proverbs 4:1–4'>Pr 4:1–4</a> J. In Disciplining Children— <a ref='Proverbs 22:6'>Pr 22:6</a> The two major themes which are interwoven and overlapping throughout Proverbs are wisdom and folly. Wisdom, which includes knowledge, understanding, instruction, discretion, and obedience, is built on the fear of the Lord and the Word of God. Folly is everything opposite to wisdom. Interpretive Challenges The first challenge is the generally elusive nature of Wisdom literature itself. Like the parables, the intended truths are often veiled from understanding if given only a cursory glance, and thus must be pondered in the heart ( <a ref='Proverbs 1:6'>1:6</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 2:1–4'>2:1–4</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 4:4–9'>4:4–9</a> ). Another challenge is the extensive use of parallelism, which is the placing of truths side by side so that the second line expands, completes, defines, emphasizes, or reaches the logical conclusion, the ultimate end, or, in some cases, the contrasting point of view. Often the actual parallel is only implied. For example, <a ref='Proverbs 12:13'>12:13</a> contains an unstated, but clearly implied parallel, in that the righteous one comes through trouble because of his virtuous speech (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 28:7'>28:7</a> ). In interpreting the Proverbs, one must: 1) determine the parallelism and often complete what is assumed and not stated by the author; 2) identify the figures of speech and rephrase the thought without those figures; 3) summarize the lesson or principle of the proverb in a few words; 4) describe the behavior that is taught; and 5) find examples inside Scripture. Challenges are also found in the various contexts of Proverbs, all of which affect interpretation and understanding. First, there is the setting in which they were spoken; this is largely the context of the young men in the royal court of the king. Second, there is the setting of the book as a whole and how its teachings are to be understood in light of the rest of Scripture. For example, there is much to be gained by comparing the wisdom Solomon taught with the wisdom Christ personified. Third, there is the historical context in which the principles and truths draw on illustrations from their own day. A final area of challenge comes in understanding that proverbs are divine guidelines and wise observations, i.e., teaching underlying principles ( <a ref='Proverbs 24:3–4'>24:3–4</a> ) which are not always inflexible laws or absolute promises. These expressions of general truth (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 10:27'>10:27</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 22:4'>22:4</a> ) generally do have “exceptions,” due to the uncertainty of life and unpredictable behavior of fallen men. God does not guarantee uniform outcome or application for each proverb, but in studying them and applying them, one comes to contemplate the mind of God, His character, His attributes, His works, and His blessings. All of the treasures of wisdom and knowledge expressed in Proverbs are hidden in Christ ( <a ref='Colossians 2:3'>Col 2:3</a> ). Outline I. Prologue ( <a ref='Proverbs 1:1–7'>1:1–7</a> ) A.

In a few brief words, he is introduced to: 1) the genre of this literature (v. <a ref='Proverbs 1:1'>1</a> ); 2) a clear two-fold purpose (vv. <a ref='Proverbs 1:2–6'>2–6</a> ); and 3) an all-important motto (v. <a ref='Proverbs 1:7'>7</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>proverbs.</b> See Introduction: Title . The proverbs are short, pithy sayings which express timeless truth and wisdom. They arrest one’s thoughts, causing the reader to reflect on how one might apply divine principles to life situations (e.g., <a ref='Proverbs 2:12'>2:12</a> ). Proverbs contains insights both in poetry and prose; yet, at the same time, it includes commands to be obeyed. God’s proverbs are not limited to this book alone (see <a ref='Genesis 10:9'>Ge 10:9</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 10:12'>1Sa 10:12</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 24:13'>24:13</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 31:29'>Jer 31:29</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 12:22'>Eze 12:22</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 18:2'>18:2</a> ). <b>Solomon.</b> See Introduction: Author and Date . As Solomon became king of Israel, he sought and received wisdom and knowledge from Yahweh ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 1:7–12'>2Chr 1:7–12</a> ), which led him to wealth, honor, and fame.

To the Hebrew mind, wisdom was not knowledge alone, but the skill of living a godly life as God intended man to live (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:5–8'>Dt 4:5–8</a> ). <b>instruction.</b> This refers to the discipline of the moral nature. <b>understanding.</b> This word looks at the mental discipline which matures one for spiritual discernment. <a ref='Proverbs 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>insight, righteousness, justice, and equity.</b> Expanding the purpose and terms of v. <a ref='Proverbs 1:2'>2a</a> , Proverbs engages in a process of schooling a son in the disciplines of: 1) wise behavior (a different Hebrew word from that in v. <a ref='Proverbs 1:2'>2</a> ) which means discreet counsel or the ability to govern oneself by choice; 2) righteousness, the application of God’s standards in dealing with others; 3) justice, the ability to conform to the will and standard of God; a practical righteousness that matches one’s positional righteousness; and 4) equity, the living of life in a fair, pleasing way. <a ref='Proverbs 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>prudence … simple.</b> The purpose is to impart discernment to the naive and the ignorant. The root of “naive” is a word meaning “an open door,” an apt description of the undiscerning, who do not know what to keep in or out of their minds. <b>youth knowledge and discretion.</b> To make one ponder before sinning, thus to make a responsible choice. <a ref='Proverbs 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>guidance.</b> The wise believer will have the ability to guide or govern others with truth. <a ref='Proverbs 1:6'>1:6</a> <b>understand a proverb … enigma.</b> Proverbs seeks to sharpen the mind by schooling one in “parabolic speech” and “dark sayings” that need reflection and interpretation. <b>riddles.</b> Study of the Scriptures is sufficient to provide the wisdom for the perplexities of life. <a ref='Proverbs 1:7'>1:7</a> <b>The fear of Yahweh.</b> The overarching theme of this book and particularly the first 9 chapters is introduced—reverence for God (see v. <a ref='Proverbs 1:29'>29</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 2:5'>2:5</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 3:7'>3:7</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 8:13'>8:13</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 9:10'>9:10</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 14:26–27'>14:26–27</a> ; cf. also <a ref='Job 28:28'>Job 28:28</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 34:11'>Ps 34:11</a> ; <a ref='Acts 9:31'>Ac 9:31</a> ). See Introduction: Historical and Theological Themes . This reverential awe and admiring, submissive fear is foundational for all spiritual knowledge and wisdom (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 2:4–6'>2:4–6</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 9:10'>9:10</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 15:33'>15:33</a> ; <a ref='Job 28:28'>Job 28:28</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 111:10'>Ps 111:10</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:13'>Ecc 12:13</a> ). While the unbeliever may make statements about life and truth, he does not have true or ultimate knowledge until he is in a redemptive relationship of reverential awe with God. Note the progression here: 1) teaching about God; 2) learning about God; 3) fearing God; 4) knowing God; and 5) imitating God’s wisdom. The fear of Yahweh is a state of mind in which one’s own attitudes, will, feelings, deeds, and goals are exchanged for God’s (cf. <a ref='Psalms 42:1'>Ps 42:1</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 1:8–9:18'>1:8—9:18</a> This lengthy section features parental praise of wisdom in the form of didactic addresses. These chapters prepare the reader for the actual proverbs that begin in <a ref='Proverbs 10:1'>10:1ff.</a> <a ref='Proverbs 1:10–19'>1:10–19</a> Here is a warning against enticement by sinners who will succeed if his son fails to embrace wisdom (v. <a ref='Proverbs 1:8'>8</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 1:10'>1:10</a> <b>sinners.</b> This term is reserved in Scripture to describe unbelievers for whom sin is continual and who endeavor to persuade even believers to sin with them ( <i>see note on <a ref='James 4:8'>Jas 4:8</a></i> ). The sins of murder and robbery are used as illustrations of such folly. <a ref='Proverbs 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>Come with us.</b> The intimidating force of peer pressure is often the way to entice those who lack wisdom. <a ref='Proverbs 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>swallow.</b> The wicked devise a plot of deception in which the innocent are captured and victimized like one who is taken by death itself—as with Joseph ( <a ref='Genesis 37:20'>Ge 37:20ff.</a> ), Jeremiah ( <a ref='Jeremiah 38:6–13'>Jer 38:6–13</a> ), and Daniel ( <a ref='Daniel 6:16–17'>Da 6:16–17</a> ). “Sheol” is the place of death. For the wicked it is a place of no return ( <a ref='Job 7:9'>Job 7:9</a> ), darkness ( <a ref='Psalms 143:3'>Ps 143:3</a> ), and torment ( <a ref='Isaiah 14:11'>Is 14:11</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>We … spoil.</b> This is the enlisting of the innocent without full disclosure of intent. Abundant spoil is promised by this outright robbery, which is made to appear easy and safe for the thieves and murderers. <a ref='Proverbs 1:15'>1:15</a> <b>do not walk.</b> This directly confronts the invitation of v. <a ref='Proverbs 1:11'>11</a> . Sin must be rejected at the first temptation (cf. <a ref='Psalms 119:114–115'>Ps 119:114–115</a> ; <a ref='James 1:15'>Jas 1:15</a> ) by refusing even the association that can lead to sin (cf. <a ref='Psalms 1:1–6'>Ps 1:1–6</a> ). Avoid the beginnings of sin (see <a ref='Proverbs 4:14'>4:14</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 1:17'>1:17</a> <b>a net is spread.</b> It would be ineffective to set up a net for catching a bird in full view of the bird. Taken with v. <a ref='Proverbs 1:18'>18</a> , this analogy means that the sinner sets up his trap for the innocent in secret, but in the end the trap is sprung on him (v. <a ref='Proverbs 1:19'>19</a> ). This greed entraps him (cf. <a ref='1 Timothy 6:9–11'>1Ti 6:9–11</a> ). Foolish sinners rush to their own ruin. <a ref='Proverbs 1:20–33'>1:20–33</a> In this section, wisdom is personified and speaks in the first person, emphasizing the serious consequences that come to those who reject it. Similar personifications of wisdom occur in <a ref='Proverbs 3:14–18'>3:14–18</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 8:1–36'>8:1–36</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 9:1–12'>9:1–12</a> . <a ref='Proverbs 1:21'>1:21</a> <b>calls out … in the city.</b> While enticement is covert and secret (v. <a ref='Proverbs 1:10'>10</a> ), wisdom, with nothing to hide, is available to everyone, being found in the most prominent of public places. <a ref='Proverbs 1:22'>1:22</a> <b>How long.</b> Three questions reveal 3 classes of those needing wisdom, and the downward progression of sin: 1) the naive or simple-minded, who are ignorant; 2) scoffers or mockers, who commit more serious, determined acts; and 3) fools or obstinate unbelievers, who will not listen to the truth. Proverbs aims its wisdom primarily at the first group. <a ref='Proverbs 1:23'>1:23</a> <b>reproof.</b> God’s wisdom brings to bear against the sinner indictments for sin that demand repentance. To the one who does repent, God promises the spirit or essence of true wisdom linked to divine revelation. <a ref='Proverbs 1:24–26'>1:24–26</a> Sinners who respond with indifference and mockery at God’s indictments increase their guilt (cf. <a ref='Romans 2:5'>Ro 2:5</a> ) and bring upon themselves the wrath of God’s mockery and indifference (vv. <a ref='Proverbs 1:26–27'>26–27</a> ). Some wait to seek God until it is too late. See <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:45'>Dt 1:45</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 28:6'>1Sa 28:6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 18:41'>Ps 18:41</a> . <a ref='Proverbs 1:26–27'>1:26–27</a> <b>disaster … dread … distress and anguish.</b> All these terms describe the severe troubles of divine judgment. When sinners who have rejected wisdom call on God in the day of judgment, God will respond to their distress with derision. <a ref='Proverbs 1:28–32'>1:28–32</a> God’s rejection of sinners is carefully detailed. This is the aspect of God’s wrath expressed in His abandonment of sinners. <i>See notes on <a ref='Romans 1:24–28'>Ro 1:24–28</a> .</i> No prayers or diligent seeking will help them (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 8:17'>8:17</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 1:28–30'>1:28–30</a> <b>I will not answer.</b> God will withdraw His invitation to sinners because they have rejected Him. Note the rejection of wisdom (v. <a ref='Proverbs 1:7'>7</a> ), knowledge (v. <a ref='Proverbs 1:22'>22</a> ), reproof (vv. <a ref='Proverbs 1:23–24'>23–24</a> ), and counsel (v. <a ref='Proverbs 1:25'>25</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 1:31'>1:31</a> <b>eat of the fruit of their way.</b> The ultimate punishment is God’s giving a people up to the result of their wickedness.

The wisdom of these words is available to those who, first of all, understand the rich value (“treasure”) that wisdom possesses.

The least bit of indifference will leave one bereft of the fullness of wisdom. <a ref='Proverbs 2:4'>2:4</a> <b>seek … search.</b> A desiring search, the most intensive of a lifetime. Cf. <a ref='Job 28:1–28'>Job 28:1–28</a> for a parallel. <a ref='Proverbs 2:6'>2:6</a> <b>His mouth.</b> The words of His mouth are contained in Scripture. It is there that God speaks (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 1:1–2'>Heb 1:1–2</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 1:20–21'>2Pe 1:20–21</a> ). Wisdom comes only by revelation. <a ref='Proverbs 2:7–8'>2:7–8</a> <b>the upright.</b> This identifies those who are true believers, who seek to know, love, and obey God and to live righteously. These covenant keepers alone can know wisdom and experience God’s protection. <a ref='Proverbs 2:9'>2:9</a> <b>righteousness and justice and equity.</b> The ethical triad of <a ref='Proverbs 1:3'>1:3</a> . <a ref='Proverbs 2:10'>2:10</a> <b>wisdom will enter your heart.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Proverbs 4:21–23'>4:21–23</a> .</i> <a ref='Proverbs 2:11'>2:11</a> <b>Discretion … Discernment.</b> Truth is the protector from all evil (see <a ref='Psalms 119:11'>Ps 119:11</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:97–104'>97–104</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 2:12'>2:12</a> <b>speaks perverse things.</b> Twisted speech is typical of those who reject wisdom (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 8:13'>Pr 8:13</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 10:31–32'>10:31–32</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 2:14'>2:14</a> Fools love most what is worst. <a ref='Proverbs 2:16'>2:16</a> <b>strange woman.</b> She is the harlot repeatedly condemned in Proverbs (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 5:1–23'>5:1–23</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 6:20–29'>6:20–29</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 7:1–27'>7:1–27</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 22:14'>22:14</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 23:27'>23:27</a> ), as in the rest of Scripture ( <a ref='Exodus 20:14'>Ex 20:14</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 20:10'>Lv 20:10</a> ). She is “foreign” or “strange” because such women were at first from outside Israel, but came to include any prostitute or adulteress.

Death in Proverbs is presented as both a gradual descent ( <a ref='Proverbs 5:23'>5:23</a> ) and a sudden end ( <a ref='Proverbs 29:1'>29:1</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 2:19'>2:19</a> <b>All who go … will not return.</b> The irreversible nature of continuing in this sin points to its devastating consequences. It leads to physical death, as expressed in the Hebrew euphemisms of v. <a ref='Proverbs 2:22'>22</a> (“cut off” and “torn away”). After that comes the reality of eternal death. <a ref='Proverbs 2:21'>2:21</a> <b>dwell in the land … remain.</b> Exactly opposite to those who live in sexual sin and are headed for death, those who belong to Yahweh will live. <i>See note on <a ref='Proverbs 8:18–21'>8:18–21</a> .</i> <a ref='Proverbs 3:1–35'>3:1–35</a> Here the study of truth leading to wisdom is commended to all. This is enforced by a contrast of the destinies of the wise and wicked. <a ref='Proverbs 3:1–20'>3:1–20</a> Solomon instructs that wisdom is: 1) rooted in sound teaching (vv. <a ref='Proverbs 3:1–4'>1–4</a> ); 2) rests in trust in God (vv. <a ref='Proverbs 3:5–6'>5–6</a> ), and 3) rewards those who obey (vv. <a ref='Proverbs 3:7–10'>7–10</a> ). While wisdom demands chastening, it brings profound benefits (vv. <a ref='Proverbs 3:13–18'>13–18</a> ), and its importance is clear since it undergirded God’s creation (vv. <a ref='Proverbs 3:19–20'>19–20</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 3:1'>3:1</a> <b>my law.</b> Hebrew “Torah,” from the verb “to throw, distribute, or teach,” hence “teaching.” It is used of God’s law ( <a ref='Proverbs 29:18'>29:18</a> ), but here it is used of the commands and principles that God gave through Solomon. <b>heart.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Proverbs 4:21–23'>4:21–23</a> .</i> <a ref='Proverbs 3:3'>3:3</a> <b>neck … heart.</b> The virtues of mercy (the Hebrew word for lovingkindness and loyal love) and truth that come from God are to become part of us—outwardly in our behavior for all to see as an adornment of spiritual beauty, and inwardly as the subject of our meditation (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:4–9'>Dt 6:4–9</a> ). Such inward and outward mercy and truth is evidence of New Covenant salvation (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 31:33–34'>Jer 31:33–34</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 3:4'>3:4</a> <b>God and man.</b> Cf.

God is promising physical well-being for those who live wisely according to His will. Such physical well-being is what David forfeited before he confessed that he had sinned against Bathsheba and Uriah (see <a ref='Psalms 32:3–4'>Pss 32:3–4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 51:8'>51:8</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 3:9–10'>3:9–10</a> <b>Honor Yahweh … wealth.</b> A biblical view of wealth demands using possessions for honoring God. This is accomplished by trusting God (v. <a ref='Proverbs 3:5'>5</a> ); by giving the best to God (“first”; cf. <a ref='Exodus 22:29'>Ex 22:29</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 23:19'>23:19</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:4'>Dt 18:4</a> ); by being fair (vv. <a ref='Proverbs 3:27–28'>27–28</a> ); by giving generously ( <a ref='Proverbs 11:25'>11:25</a> ); and by expressing gratitude for all He gives ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:10–12'>Dt 6:10–12</a> ). The result of such faithfulness to honor Him is prosperity and satisfaction. <a ref='Proverbs 3:11–12'>3:11–12</a> <b>not reject … discipline.</b> Since even the wisest of God’s children are subject to sin, there is necessity of God’s fatherly discipline to increase wisdom and blessing. Such correction should not be resisted. <i>See notes on <a ref='Hebrews 12:5–11'>Heb 12:5–11</a> .</i> <a ref='Proverbs 3:14–15'>3:14–15</a> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 19:10–11'>Ps 19:10–11</a> . Divine wisdom yields the richest treasures, described in vv. <a ref='Proverbs 3:14–18'>14–18</a> as “profit,” “Length of days,” “riches,” “glory,” “pleasant ways,” “peace,” “life,” and “blessed.” <a ref='Proverbs 3:18'>3:18</a> <b>tree of life.</b> This expression is a metaphor referring to temporal and spiritual renewal and refreshment (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 11:30'>11:30</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 13:12'>13:12</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 15:4'>15:4</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 3:19–20'>3:19–20</a> Solomon is indicating that wisdom is basic to all of life, for by it God created everything.

The heart is the depository of all wisdom and the source of whatever affects speech (v. <a ref='Proverbs 4:24'>24</a> ), sight (v. <a ref='Proverbs 4:25'>25</a> ), and conduct (vv. <a ref='Proverbs 4:26–27'>26–27</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 5:1–2'>5:1–2</a> <b>pay attention.</b> The wise father marshals all the essential terms to sum up his call to wisdom (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 1:2'>1:2</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 2:2'>2:2</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 3:13'>3:13</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 4:5'>4:5</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 5:3'>5:3</a> <b>lips … speech.</b> Seduction begins with deceptive flattery (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 2:16'>2:16</a> ).

The focus here is on the guilty suffering of the one who yields to lust rather than obeying God’s law. Contrast the proper response to such temptation in the case of Joseph ( <a ref='Genesis 39:1–12'>Ge 39:1–12</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 5:9–10'>5:9–10</a> <b>your splendor to others.</b> The consequences of this sin may include slavery, as a commuted punishment, instead of death that should have come for adultery ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:22'>Dt 22:22</a> ). In that case, “the cruel one” was the judge, and the “others” were the masters to whom all the energy of youth was directed in slavery. All personal wealth was lost to outsiders, and one served in a stranger’s house helping him to prosper. <a ref='Proverbs 5:11'>5:11</a> <b>flesh and … body.</b> This could be a reference to venereal disease (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:18'>1Co 6:18</a> ), or to the natural end of life.

There can be public confession, discipline, and forgiveness, but not restoration to one’s former place of honor and service. See <a ref='Proverbs 6:33'>6:33</a> . <a ref='Proverbs 5:15–19'>5:15–19</a> Using the imagery of water, the joy of a faithful marriage is contrasted with the disaster of infidelity (vv. <a ref='Proverbs 5:9–14'>9–14</a> ). “Cistern” and “well” refer to the wife from whom the husband is to draw all his satisfying refreshment, sexually and affectionately (v. <a ref='Proverbs 5:15'>15</a> ; cf. <a ref='Proverbs 9:17–18'>9:17–18</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:9–11'>SS 4:9–11</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 5:16–17'>5:16–17</a> <b>springs … streams.</b> The euphemism refers to the male procreation capacity with the idea of the foolish as a fountain (“spring”) scattering precious water—a picture of the wastefulness of sexual promiscuity. The result of such indiscriminate sin is called “streams of water in the streets,” a graphic description of the illegitimate street children of harlotry. Rather, says Solomon, “let them be for you alone” and not the children of such immoral strangers. <a ref='Proverbs 5:18'>5:18</a> <b>fountain be blessed.</b> God offers to bless male procreation when it is confined to one’s wife. It should be noted that, in spite of the sinful polygamy of David and Solomon, as well as the disastrous polygamy of Rehoboam (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 11:21'>2Chr 11:21</a> ), the instruction here identifies God’s ideal as one wife from youth on. <a ref='Proverbs 5:19'>5:19</a> <b>graceful doe.</b> The doe has graceful beauty in her face and form and is often used in the poetry of Bible times for the beauty of a woman. <b>breasts.</b> This is imagery of affection (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:13'>SS 1:13</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:1–7'>4:1–7</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:7–8'>7:7–8</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 5:20'>5:20</a> Such behavior is presented as having no benefit; thus, to justify such folly is senseless. <a ref='Proverbs 5:21–22'>5:21–22</a> <b>watches … held.</b> Yahweh sees all that man does and in mercy withholds immediate judgment, allowing the sinner time to repent or to be caught in his own sin (cf. <a ref='Numbers 32:23'>Nu 32:23</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 7:15–16'>Pss 7:15–16</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 57:6'>57:6</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 1:17'>Pr 1:17</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 6:7–8'>Ga 6:7–8</a> ).

While there is precedent for such a practice, it is far better to give to those in need (see <a ref='Proverbs 19:17'>19:17</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 15:1–15'>Dt 15:1–15</a> ) or lend without interest (see <a ref='Proverbs 28:8'>28:8</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 25:35–38'>Lv 25:35–38</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 6:2–4'>6:2–4</a> <b>snared … come into the hand.</b> Cf. <a ref='Proverbs 22:26–27'>22:26–27</a> . Anyone who becomes responsible for another person’s debt is trapped and controlled because he has yielded control of what God has given him as a stewardship. The situation is so serious that it is imperative to take control of one’s own God-given resources and get out of such an intolerable arrangement immediately (“deliver yourself,” vv. <a ref='Proverbs 6:3–4'>3–4</a> ) before coming to poverty or slavery. Cf. <a ref='Genesis 43:9'>Ge 43:9</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 44:32–33'>44:32–33</a> . <a ref='Proverbs 6:6–11'>6:6–11</a> A warning against laziness is appropriate after the discussion on the folly of guaranteeing someone else’s debt, since it is often lazy people who want sureties. <a ref='Proverbs 6:6'>6:6</a> <b>ant … sluggard.</b> Cf. <a ref='Proverbs 30:25'>30:25</a> . The ant is an example of industry, diligence, and planning (vv. <a ref='Proverbs 6:7–8'>7–8</a> ) and serves as a rebuke to a sluggard (a lazy person who lacks self-control).

Each offers a glimpse of the Creator’s power and wisdom (cf. <a ref='Job 38:1–42:6'>Job 38:1—42:6</a> ) and illustrates the dignity and confidence of those who walk wisely. <a ref='Proverbs 30:31'>30:31</a> <b>strutting rooster.</b> The meaning in Hebrew is uncertain. Other possibilities are 1) a greyhound or 2) a warhorse ready for battle. Cf. <a ref='Job 39:19–25'>Job 39:19–25</a> . <b>male goat.</b> This is the he-goat that was the leader of the flock. Cf. <a ref='Daniel 8:5'>Da 8:5</a> . <a ref='Proverbs 30:32'>30:32</a> put your <b>hand on your mouth.</b> Lit. “stop your scheming and talking”—a gesture of awestruck, self-imposed silence. Cf. <a ref='Job 21:5'>Job 21:5</a> ; <a ref='Job 29:9'>29:9</a> ; <a ref='Job 40:4'>40:4</a> . <a ref='Proverbs 30:33'>30:33</a> <b>brings forth … brings forth … brings forth.</b> The verb is the same in all 3 instances. These are natural causes and effects to show that anger pressed beyond certain limits produces conflict. <a ref='Proverbs 31:1–31'>31:1–31</a> This concluding chapter contains two poems: 1) The Wise King ( <a ref='Proverbs 31:2–9'>31:2–9</a> ) and 2) The Excellent Wife ( <a ref='Proverbs 31:10–31'>31:10–31</a> ). Both are the teachings of a godly mother (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:1'>1</a> ) to King Lemuel, whom ancient Jewish tradition identified as King Solomon, but who is otherwise unknown. <a ref='Proverbs 31:1'>31:1</a> <b>oracle.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Proverbs 30:1'>30:1</a> .</i> <b>mother disciplined him.</b> See <a ref='Proverbs 1:8'>1:8</a> . <a ref='Proverbs 31:2–9'>31:2–9</a> The godly king is addressed (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:2'>2</a> ) and told that his reign should be characterized by: 1) holiness (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:3'>3</a> ); 2) sobriety (vv. <a ref='Proverbs 31:4–7'>4–7</a> ); and 3) compassion (vv. <a ref='Proverbs 31:8–9'>8–9</a> ). This section is filled with succinct and solemn warnings against vices to which kings are particularly susceptible—immorality, overindulgence, unrighteous rule, and indifference to those in need. <a ref='Proverbs 31:2'>31:2</a> <b>my son.</b> The phrase is repeated 3 times to indicate the serious passion of a mother’s heart. <b>son of my vows.</b> Like Hannah, she had dedicated her child to Yahweh (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:11'>1Sa 1:11</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 1:27'>27</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 1:28'>28</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 31:3'>31:3</a> <b>Do not give your excellence to women.</b> Multiplying foreign wives destroys a king as it did Solomon (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:17'>Dt 17:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 11:1–4'>1Ki 11:1–4</a> ). <i>See notes on <a ref='Proverbs 5:9–11'>5:9–11</a> .</i> <a ref='Proverbs 31:4–5'>31:4–5</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Proverbs 20:1'>20:1</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 23:29–35'>23:29–35</a> .</i> Intoxicating drinks can weaken reason and judgment, loosen convictions, or pervert the heart. They do not suit rulers who need clear, steady minds and keen judgment. <a ref='Proverbs 31:6–7'>31:6–7</a> <b>Give strong drink.</b> Such extreme situations, possibly relating to a criminal on death row or someone agonizing in pain with a terminal illness or tragic circumstance, are in utter contrast to that of the king (cf. <a ref='Psalms 104:15'>Ps 104:15</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 31:8–9'>31:8–9</a> <b>Open your mouth.</b> Plead for those who cannot plead their own case, namely those who are otherwise ruined by their condition of weakness. The king’s duty was to righteously uphold the case of the helpless in both physical (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:6'>6</a> ) and material (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:9'>9</a> ) crises. The monarch thus mediates the compassion of God. <i>See note on <a ref='Proverbs 14:31'>14:31</a> .</i> <a ref='Proverbs 31:10–31'>31:10–31</a> This poem offers a beautiful description of the excellent wife as defined by a wife and mother (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:1'>1</a> ). Spiritual and practical wisdom plus moral virtues mark the character of this woman in contrast to the immoral women of v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:3'>3</a> . While the scene here is of a wealthy home and the customs of the ancient Near East, the principles apply to every family. They are set forth as the prayer of every mother for the future wife of her son, and literarily arranged with each of the 22 verses beginning with the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet in consecutive order. <a ref='Proverbs 31:10–12'>31:10–12</a> This section describes her marriage. <a ref='Proverbs 31:10'>31:10</a> <b>excellent.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Proverbs 12:4'>12:4</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Ruth 3:11'>Ru 3:11</a> . <b>who can find?</b> She does exist, but is very hard to find. Cf. <a ref='Proverbs 18:22'>18:22</a> . <a ref='Proverbs 31:11'>31:11</a> <b>trusts in her.</b> He does not maintain jealous guard over her or keep his valuables locked up so that she cannot access them as was a common ancient practice in a house of distrust. She demonstrates impeccable loyalty to her husband, and her thrift and industry will add to his wealth. <a ref='Proverbs 31:13–24'>31:13–24</a> This section describes her behavior. <a ref='Proverbs 31:13'>31:13</a> <b>searches for wool and flax.</b> Excellent women gathered the material for making clothes (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:19'>19</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 31:14'>31:14</a> <b>like merchant ships.</b> Excellent women would go far to secure the best food for their families. <a ref='Proverbs 31:15'>31:15</a> <b>rises while it is still night.</b> In order to have the food prepared for the family each day, she had to rise before dawn to begin the work, which she would do gladly. <a ref='Proverbs 31:16'>31:16</a> <b>makes plans for a field.</b> She was resourceful and entrepreneurial in her investing and reinvesting. <a ref='Proverbs 31:17'>31:17</a> Such women were not soft, but by virtue of rigorous work, strong. <a ref='Proverbs 31:18'>31:18</a> <b>gain is good.</b> That which she produced for the family of clothing, food, and wealth was good and profitable. <b>lamp … night.</b> Lamp is to be understood literally (cf. v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:15'>15</a> ). She planted the vineyard during the day (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:16'>16</a> ) and wove late at night (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:19'>19</a> ). She rose early before dawn to prepare the food (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:15'>15</a> ), thus keeping a before-sunrise to after-dark schedule to care for her household, which was the foremost priority of her life (cf. <a ref='Titus 2:5'>Tit 2:5</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 31:19'>31:19</a> <b>distaff … spindle.</b> These tools are used to turn wool into thread for making clothing. Cf. <a ref='Exodus 35:25'>Ex 35:25</a> . <a ref='Proverbs 31:20–24'>31:20–24</a> Her activities, driven by the priority of caring for her family, resulted in multiplied fruitfulness for: 1) the poor and needy (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:20'>20</a> ); 2) her own household (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:21'>21</a> ); 3) herself (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:22'>22</a> ); 4) her husband (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:23'>23</a> ); and 5) the tradesmen (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:24'>24</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 31:21'>31:21</a> <b>snow.</b> Snow indicates the cold that occurs in the high altitudes of Israel. Her labors anticipated her family’s need for warm clothing in such cold places and seasons. <a ref='Proverbs 31:22'>31:22</a> <b>fine linen and purple.</b> The efforts she makes to honor others are rewarded to her. These silk and purple garments are expensive evidences of the blessings returned to her by God’s grace. <a ref='Proverbs 31:23'>31:23</a> <b>known in the gates.</b> This woman made a significant contribution to her husband’s position in the community and to his success (vv. <a ref='Proverbs 31:10–12'>10–12</a> ). His domestic comfort promoted his advancement in public honor. A man’s good reputation begins with his home and thus the virtue of his wife (cf <a ref='Proverbs 18:22'>18:22</a> ). <a ref='Proverbs 31:24'>31:24</a> <b>makes … sells</b> them. With all her other responsibilities faithfully discharged, she took time to make items of clothing for the purposes of trade. <a ref='Proverbs 31:25–27'>31:25–27</a> This section emphasizes her character. <a ref='Proverbs 31:25'>31:25</a> <b>Strength and majesty.</b> These words describe the character of the woman who fears Yahweh. Her inward clothing displays divine wisdom, giving her confidence to face the future with its unexpected challenges. <a ref='Proverbs 31:26'>31:26</a> <b>opens her mouth … instruction of lovingkindness.</b> Her teaching of wisdom and the law is tempered with mercy. <a ref='Proverbs 31:27'>31:27</a> She was a skilled manager of the home. <i>See note on <a ref='Titus 2:4–5'>Tit 2:4–5</a> .</i> <b>bread of idleness.</b> Lit. “eyes looking everywhere” as in the lazy man (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 6:6'>6:6</a> , <a ref='Proverbs 6:9'>9</a> ) of whom the same root word is used. <a ref='Proverbs 31:28–29'>31:28–29</a> This section describes her family life. <a ref='Proverbs 31:28'>31:28</a> <b>rise up and bless her.</b> She was greatly respected because she has earned the praise of her family. <i>See note on <a ref='Proverbs 29:17'>29:17</a> .</i> There can be no higher joy for a mother than for her children to grow up to praise her as the source of the wisdom that made them godly. <i>See note on <a ref='1 Timothy 2:15'>1Ti 2:15</a> .</i> <a ref='Proverbs 31:29–30'>31:29–30</a> <b>you have gone above them all.</b> This was her husband’s superlative praise (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:28'>28</a> ) which was well-deserved, in which he used the same word for “excellent” found in v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:10'>10</a> . <a ref='Proverbs 31:30–31'>31:30–31</a> This portion summarizes her spiritual life. <a ref='Proverbs 31:30'>31:30</a> <b>Charm … beauty.</b> True holiness and virtue command permanent respect and affection, far more than charm and beauty of face and form.

While she receives material reward (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:22'>22</a> ), the praise and success she labored to bring to her family and community will be her praise. The result of all her efforts is her best eulogy.",
