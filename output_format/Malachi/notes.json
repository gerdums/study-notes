In response to the affirmation of Yahweh’s love for them, the people, looking only at what they had lost since the captivity and how feeble their nation was, incredulously expressed doubt about God’s love and insolently challenged it. Nevertheless, God reaffirmed His love to them, recalling His covenant choice of Jacob over Esau, father of the Edomites (cf. Ge 25:23 ). In this closing book of the OT, God’s electing love toward Israel, sovereign, undeserved, and persistent (cf. Ro 9:13 ), is boldly and explicitly reiterated by Yahweh Himself and illustrated by His choice of Jacob and his offspring. Unconditionally, and completely apart from any consideration of human merit, God elected Jacob and his descendants to become His heirs of promise (cf. Ro 9:6–29 ). No one should conclude that God does not love His people because He afflicted them, but rather He loves them because He elected them."

Employing a wordplay on the name of Malachi, (“Yahweh’s messenger”), Yahweh Himself announced He was sending one who would “prepare the way before Me.” This is the voice of one “calling” in the wilderness ( Is 40:3 ) and the Elijah of 4:5 who comes before Yahweh.

Ashes were often poured on foot trails to provide a more solid pathway during wet weather. Here the wicked are compared to ashes, which the righteous will tread down as a result of the fire of God’s judgment (cf. v. 1 ). The prophet desires, as should all believers, that there be far-reaching repentance, and if not, destruction of the impenitent is inescapable."

Mt 17:1–4 ) and may be the two witnesses in the Great Tribulation (cf. Rev 11:1–3 ). Most likely, this will be an Elijah-like person, as John the Baptist was Elijah-like ( see note on 3:1 ). In that day, his task will be to preach reconciliation to God so that souls can believe and be spared God’s curse. He will be effective (v. 6 )."

Mt 10:34–36 ) anticipates a general societal repentance (cf. Mt 25:31–46 ; Rev 7:9–17 ; 20:4–6 ), so that complete destruction might be averted. The earth will be restored to Edenic wonder, the curse reversed, the kingdom established with Messiah reigning, and the righteous Jews and Gentiles entering it. destruction. This word refers to the practice of devoting things or persons irrevocably to God, often by total destruction. Cities of Canaan were devoted to “destruction,” and thus the people were to be exterminated (cf. Dt 13:12–18 ; 20:16ff. ). Its use here suggests that God would make a whole burnt offering of the earth if there was not a repentant remnant."
