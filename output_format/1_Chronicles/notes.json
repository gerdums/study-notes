Tithes were required for taxation, to fund the theocracy, similar to taxation today. The law required that to be paid. This, however, is the voluntary giving from the heart to Yahweh. The NT speaks of this (cf. Lk 6:38 ; 2Co 9:1–8 ) and never demands that a tithe be given to God, but that taxes be paid to one’s government (cf. Ro 13:6–7 ). Paying taxes and giving God whatever one is willing to give, based on devotion to Him and His glory, is biblical giving."
