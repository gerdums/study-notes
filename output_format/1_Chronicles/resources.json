    "content": "The First and Second Books of the Chronicles Title The original title in the Hebrew Bible read “The annals (i.e., events or happenings) of the days.” First and Second Chronicles were comprised of one book until later divided into separate books in the Greek OT translation, the Septuagint (LXX), ca. 200 BC. The title also changed at that time to the inaccurate title, “the things omitted,” i.e., reflecting material not in 1-2 Samuel and 1-2 Kings. The English title “Chronicles” originated with Jerome’s Latin Vulgate translation (ca. 400 AD), which used the fuller title “The Chronicles of the Entire Sacred History.” Author and Date Neither 1 nor 2 Chronicles contains direct statements regarding the human author, though Jewish tradition strongly favors Ezra the priest (cf. <a ref='Ezra 7:1–6'>Ezr 7:1–6</a> ) as “the chronicler.” These records were most likely recorded ca. 450–430 BC. The genealogical record in <a ref='1Ch 1-9'>1Chr 1–9</a> supports a date after 450 BC for the writing. The NT does not directly quote either 1 or 2 Chronicles. Background and Setting The immediate historical backdrop encompassed the Jews’ three-phase return to the Promised Land from the Babylonian exile: 1) Zerubbabel in <a ref='Ezr 1-6'>Ezr 1–6</a> (ca. 538 BC); 2) Ezra in <a ref='Ezr 7-10'>Ezr 7–10</a> (ca. 458 BC); and 3) Nehemiah in <a ref='Ne 1-13'>Ne 1–13</a> (ca. 445 BC). Previous history looks back to the Babylonian deportation/Exile (ca. 605–538 BC) as predicted/reported by 2 Kings, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Habakkuk. The prophets of this restoration era were Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. The Jews had returned from their 70 years of captivity (ca. 538 BC) to a land that was markedly different from the one once ruled by King David (ca. 1011–971 BC) and King Solomon (971–931 BC): 1) there was no Hebrew king, but rather a Persian governor ( <a ref='Ezra 5:3'>Ezr 5:3</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 6:6'>6:6</a> ); 2) there was no security for Jerusalem, so Nehemiah had to rebuild the wall ( <a ref='Ne 1-7'>Ne 1–7</a> ); 3) there was no temple, so Zerubbabel had to reconstruct a pitiful semblance of the Solomonic temple’s former glory ( <a ref='Ezr 3'>Ezr 3</a> ); 4) the Jews no longer dominated the region, but rather were on the defensive ( <a ref='Ezr 4'>Ezr 4</a> ; <a ref='Ne 4'>Ne 4</a> ); 5) they enjoyed few divine blessings beyond the fact of their return; 6) they possessed little of the kingdom’s former wealth; and 7) God’s divine presence no longer resided in Jerusalem, having departed ca. 597–591 BC ( <a ref='Eze 8-11'>Eze 8–11</a> ). To put it mildly, their future looked bleak compared to their majestic past, especially the time of David and Solomon. The return could best be described as bittersweet, i.e., bitter because their present poverty brought hurtful memories about what was forfeited by God’s judgment on their ancestors’ sin, but sweet because at least they were back in the Land God had given Abraham 17 centuries earlier ( <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> ). The chronicler’s selective genealogy and history of Israel, stretching from Adam ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 1:1'>1Chr 1:1</a> ) to the return from Babylon ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 26:23'>2Chr 26:23</a> ), was intended to remind the Jews of God’s promises and intentions about: 1) the Land; 2) the nation; 3) the Davidic king; 4) the Levitical priests; 5) the temple; and 6) true worship, none of which had been abrogated because of the Babylonian captivity. All of this was to remind them of their spiritual heritage during the difficult times they faced, and to encourage them to be faithful to God. Historical and Theological Themes First and Second Chronicles, as named by Jerome, recreate an OT history in miniature, with particular emphases on the Davidic Covenant and temple worship. In terms of literary parallel, 1 Chronicles is the partner of 2 Samuel, in that both detail the reign of King David. First Chronicles opens with Adam ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 1:1'>1:1</a> ) and closes with the death of David ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 29:26–30'>29:26–30</a> ) in 971 BC. Second Chronicles begins with Solomon ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 1:1'>1:1</a> ) and covers the same historical period as 1 and 2 Kings, while focusing exclusively on the kings of the southern kingdom of Judah, thus excluding the history of the northern 10 tribes and their rulers, because of their complete wickedness and false worship. It ranges from the reign of Solomon ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 1:1'>1:1</a> ) in 971 BC to the return from Babylon in 538 BC ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:23'>36:23</a> ). Over 55 percent of the material in Chronicles is unique, i.e., not found in 2 Samuel or 1 and 2 Kings. The “chronicler” tended to omit what was negative or in opposition to the Davidic kingship; on the other hand, he tended to make unique contributions in validating temple worship and the line of David. Whereas <a ref='2Ki 25'>2Ki 25</a> ends dismally with the deportation of Judah to Babylon, <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:22–23'>2Chr 36:22–23</a> concludes hopefully with the Jews’ release from Persia and return to Jerusalem. These two books were written to the repatriated Jewish exiles as a chronicle of God’s intention of future blessing, in spite of the nation’s past moral/spiritual failure for which the people paid dearly under God’s wrath. First and Second Chronicles could be briefly summarized as follows: I. A Selected Genealogical History of Israel ( <a ref='1Ch 1-9'>1Chr 1–9</a> ) II. Israel’s United Kingdom Under Saul ( <a ref='1Ch 10'>1Chr 10</a> ), David ( <a ref='1Ch 11-29'>1Chr 11–29</a> ), and Solomon ( <a ref='2Ch 1-9'>2Chr 1–9</a> ) III. Judah’s Monarchy in the Divided Kingdom ( <a ref='2Ch 10-36:21'>2Chr 10–36:21</a> ) IV. Judah’s Release From Their Seventy Year Captivity ( <i><a ref='2 Chronicles 36:22–23'>2Chr 36:22–23</a></i> ). The historical themes are inextricably linked with the theological in that God’s divine purposes for Israel have been and will be played out on the stage of human history. These two books are designed to assure the returning Jews that, in spite of their checkered past and present plight, God will be true to His covenant promises. They have been returned by God to the Land first given to Abraham as a race of people whose ethnic identity (Jewish) was not obliterated by the deportation and whose national identity (Israel) has been preserved ( <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 15:5'>15:5</a> ), although they are still under God’s judgment as prescribed by the Mosaic legislation ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:15–68'>Dt 28:15–68</a> ). The priestly line of Eleazar’s son Phinehas and the Levitical line were still intact so that temple worship could continue in the hopes that God’s presence would one day return ( <a ref='Numbers 25:10–13'>Nu 25:10–13</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 3:1'>Mal 3:1</a> ). The Davidic promise of a king was still valid, although future in its fulfillment ( <a ref='2 Samuel 7:8–17'>2Sa 7:8–17</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 17:7–15'>1Chr 17:7–15</a> ). Their individual hope of eternal life and restoration of God’s blessings forever rested in the New Covenant ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer 31:31–34</a> ). Two basic principles enumerated in these two books prevail throughout the OT, namely, obedience brings blessing, disobedience brings judgment. In the Chronicles, when the king obeyed and trusted the Lord, God blessed and protected. But when the king disobeyed and/or put his trust in something or someone other than the Lord, God withdrew His blessing and protection. Three basic failures by the kings of Judah brought God’s wrath: 1) personal sin; 2) false worship/idolatry; and/or 3) trust in man rather than God. Interpretive Challenges First and Second Chronicles present a combination of selective genealogical and historical records and no insurmountable challenges within the two books are encountered. A few issues arise, such as: 1) Who wrote 1 and 2 Chronicles? Does the overlap of <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:22–23'>2Chr 36:22–23</a> with <a ref='Ezra 1:1–3'>Ezr 1:1–3</a> point to Ezra as author? 2) Does the use of multiple sources taint the inerrancy doctrine of Scripture? 3) How does one explain the variations in the genealogies of <a ref='1Ch 1-9'>1Chr 1–9</a> from other OT genealogies? 4) Are the curses of <a ref='De 28'>Dt 28</a> still in force, even though the 70-year captivity has concluded? 5) How does one explain the few variations in numbers when comparing Chronicles with parallel passages in Samuel and Kings? These will be dealt with in the notes at the appropriate places. Outline I. Selective Genealogy ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 1:1–9:34'>1:1—9:34</a> ) A.

The tribe of Judah leads the list, indicating its importance, no doubt because of the Davidic heritage. After Judah, Levi receives the most attention, indicating the importance of their priestly role. Joseph ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 2:2'>2:2</a> ) is later enumerated in terms of his sons Manasseh and Ephraim. Dan and Zebulun are not mentioned here, although they both are identified in the millennial distribution of land (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 48:1–2'>Eze 48:1–2</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 48:26–27'>26–27</a> ). The exact reason for these omissions is unknown. Benjamin is given additional attention in <a ref='1 Chronicles 8:1–40'>8:1–40</a> . The tribes are mentioned as follows: 1) Judah ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 2:3–4:23'>2:3—4:23</a> ); 2) Simeon ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 4:24–43'>4:24–43</a> ); 3) Reuben ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 5:1–10'>5:1–10</a> ); 4) Gad ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 5:11–22'>5:11–22</a> ); 5) Manasseh-East ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 5:23–26'>5:23–26</a> ); 6) Levi ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:1–81'>6:1–81</a> ); 7) Issachar ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 7:1–5'>7:1–5</a> ); 8) Benjamin ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 7:6–12'>7:6–12</a> ); 9) Naphtali ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 7:13'>7:13</a> ); 10) Manasseh-West ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 7:14–19'>7:14–19</a> ); 11) Ephraim ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 7:20–29'>7:20–29</a> ); and 12) Asher ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 7:30–40'>7:30–40</a> ). <a ref='1 Chronicles 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>Achar.</b> This is a variant spelling of Achan, who in <a ref='Joshua 7:1–26'>Jos 7:1–26</a> disobeyed Yahweh by taking goods from under God’s Jericho ban. <a ref='1 Chronicles 3:1–4'>3:1–4</a> See <a ref='2 Samuel 3:2–5'>2Sa 3:2–5</a> . <a ref='1 Chronicles 3:1'>3:1</a> <b>David.</b> The chief reason for such detailed genealogies is that they affirm the line of Christ from Adam ( <a ref='Luke 3:38'>Lk 3:38</a> ) through Abraham and David ( <a ref='Matthew 1:1'>Mt 1:1</a> ), thus emphasizing the kingdom intentions of God in Christ. <a ref='1 Chronicles 3:5–8'>3:5–8</a> See <a ref='2 Samuel 5:14–16'>2Sa 5:14–16</a> and <a ref='1 Chronicles 14:4–7'>1Chr 14:4–7</a> . <a ref='1 Chronicles 3:10–16'>3:10–16</a> <b>Rehoboam … Zedekiah.</b> The reigns of these descendants of David are delineated in <a ref='2 Chronicles 10:1–36:21'>2Chr 10:1—36:21</a> . <a ref='1 Chronicles 3:16'>3:16</a> <b>Jeconiah.</b> God’s curse resulting in no royal descendants from the line of Jeconiah (a.k.a. Jehoiachin), as given by Jeremiah ( <a ref='Jeremiah 22:30'>Jer 22:30</a> ), was enforced by God. Even though Jeconiah was in the line of Christ, the Messiah was not a physical child of that line, thus affirming the curse, yet sustaining the legality of His kingship through Joseph, who was in David’s line. His blood birthright came through Mary, who traced her line to David through his son Nathan, not Solomon (cf. <a ref='Luke 3:31'>Lk 3:31</a> ). <a ref='1 Chronicles 3:22'>3:22</a> <b>six</b> Only 5 sons are named, so the number includes their father Shemaiah. <a ref='1 Chronicles 4:41'>4:41</a> <b>Hezekiah.</b> He ruled Judah ca. 715–686 BC. <a ref='1 Chronicles 4:43'>4:43</a> <b>Amalekites.</b> Longstanding enemies of Israel whom God purposed to exterminate. Another branch of the Amalekite family tree had appeared in Persia, represented by Haman, who attempted to exterminate the Jews ( <a ref='Es 3:1'>Es 3:1ff.</a> ). <a ref='1 Chronicles 5:2'>5:2</a> <b>Judah prevailed.</b> In accordance with Jacob’s blessing ( <a ref='Genesis 49:10'>Ge 49:10</a> ), the king of Israel is to come from Judah. This prophecy had historical reference to the Davidic Covenant (cf. <a ref='2Sa 7'>2Sa 7</a> ; <a ref='1Ch 17'>1Chr 17</a> ) with full messianic implications. <a ref='1 Chronicles 5:6'>5:6</a> <b>Tilgath-pilneser.</b> The king of Assyria (ca. 745–727 BC) who threatened Judah and made Ahaz pay a tribute (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 16:7–20'>2Ki 16:7–20</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 28:16–21'>2Chr 28:16–21</a> ). <a ref='1 Chronicles 5:22'>5:22</a> <b>the exile.</b> The Assyrian deportation of 722 BC is meant (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 5:26'>5:26</a> ). <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:1–15'>6:1–15</a> This section lists the High Priestly lineage from Levi ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:1'>6:1</a> ) through Aaron ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:3'>6:3</a> ), through Eleazar ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:3–4'>6:3–4</a> ), and through Phinehas ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:4'>6:4</a> ), with whom God covenanted for a perpetual priesthood ( <a ref='Numbers 25:11–13'>Nu 25:11–13</a> ). <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:8'>6:8</a> <b>Zadok.</b> By the time of David’s reign, the High Priestly line had wrongly been shifted to the sons of Ithamar as represented by Abiathar. When Abiathar sided with Adonijah rather than Solomon, Zadok became the ruling High Priest ( <a ref='1 Kings 2:26–27'>1Ki 2:26–27</a> ) and restored the high-priesthood to the Levitical line through Phinehas (cf. <a ref='Numbers 25:10–13'>Nu 25:10–13</a> ). <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:13'>6:13</a> <b>Hilkiah.</b> The High Priest who rediscovered the law in Josiah’s reign ca. 622 BC ( <a ref='2 Kings 22:8–13'>2Ki 22:8–13</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 34:14–21'>2Chr 34:14–21</a> ). <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:14'>6:14</a> <b>Seraiah.</b> The High Priest who was executed by the Babylonians after their occupation of Jerusalem ca. 586 BC ( <a ref='2 Kings 25:18–21'>2Ki 25:18–21</a> ). <b>Jehozadak.</b> (a.k.a. Jozadak.) The father of Jeshua, the first High Priest in the return (cf. <a ref='Ezra 3:2'>Ezr 3:2</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 5:2'>5:2</a> ). <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:16–30'>6:16–30</a> The sons of Levi ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:16–19'>6:16–19</a> ) and their families ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:20–30'>6:20–30</a> ) are given here. <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:27–28'>6:27–28</a> Samuel, a Levite, by exceptional, divine direction, offered priestly sacrifices (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 7:9'>1Sa 7:9</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 10:8'>10:8</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 11:14–15'>11:14–15</a> ). The fact that Elkanah was from Ephraim ( <a ref='1 Samuel 1:1'>1Sa 1:1</a> ) indicates where he lived, not his family history ( <a ref='Numbers 35:6–8'>Nu 35:6–8</a> ). <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:31–48'>6:31–48</a> The Levitical musicians are listed as they relate to: 1) Kohath and Heman ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:33–38'>6:33–38</a> ); 2) Gershon and Asaph ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:39–43'>6:39–43</a> ); and 3) Merari and Ethan ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:44–47'>6:44–47</a> ). <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:49–53'>6:49–53</a> This is a repeat of the High Priestly line enumerated in <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:4–8'>6:4–8</a> through Zadok. This repeated genealogy could possibly point to the Zadokian high-priesthood for the temple in the Millennium (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:46'>Eze 40:46</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 43:19'>43:19</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 44:15'>44:15</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 48:11'>48:11</a> ). <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:54–81'>6:54–81</a> This section rehearses the 48 cities given to the Levites instead of a section of land (cf. <a ref='Numbers 35:1–8'>Nu 35:1–8</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 21:1–42'>Jos 21:1–42</a> ) which signals God’s intention for the Jewish nation to have a priesthood and future in the land first given to Abraham (cf. <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> ). <a ref='1 Chronicles 8:1–40'>8:1–40</a> This section enlarges on the genealogy of Benjamin in <a ref='1 Chronicles 7:6–12'>7:6–12</a> , most likely because of that tribe’s important relationship with Judah in the southern kingdom. Thus these two tribes taken in captivity together and the Levites make up the returning remnant in 538 BC. <a ref='1 Chronicles 9:1'>9:1</a> <b>all Israel.</b> Even though the northern kingdom of Israel never returned from dispersion in 722 BC, many from the 10 tribes which made up that kingdom migrated south after the division in 931 BC. The result was that Judah, the southern kingdom, had people from all tribes, so that when returning from captivity “all Israel” was truly represented. The Chronicles’ Sources The inspiration of Scripture ( <a ref='2 Timothy 3:16'>2Ti 3:16</a> ) was sometimes accomplished through direct revelation from God without a human writer, e.g., the Mosaic law. At other times, God used human sources, as mentioned in <a ref='Luke 1:1–4'>Lk 1:1–4</a> . Such was the experience of the chronicler as evidenced by the many contributing sources. Whether the material came through direct revelation or by existing resources, God’s inspiration through the Holy Spirit prevented the original human authors of Scripture from any error ( <a ref='2 Peter 1:19–21'>2Pe 1:19–21</a> ). Although relatively few scribal errors have been made in copying Scripture, they can be identified and corrected. Thus, the original, inerrant content of the Bible has been preserved. 1.

Neither God nor Satan forced David to sin (cf. <a ref='James 1:13–15'>Jas 1:13–15</a> ), but God allowed Satan to tempt David, and he chose to sin.

The reasons Eleazar’s family had twice as many divisions were that: 1) he had received the birthright since his older brothers, Nadab and Abihu, had been killed ( <a ref='Le 10'>Lv 10</a> ); 2) he had more descendants; and 3) his descendants had more leadership ability. These divisions each served for either 1) two-week periods annually or, more likely, 2) a one-month period every two years (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 27:1–15'>27:1–15</a> ). These divisions appear again in <a ref='Nehemiah 10:2–8'>Ne 10:2–8</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 12:1–7'>12:1–7</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 12:12–21'>12:12–21</a> .

It is proclaiming truth (v. <a ref='1 Chronicles 25:5'>5</a> ) to people (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 14:3'>1Co 14:3</a> ), and music is a vehicle for such proclamation in praise (v. <a ref='1 Chronicles 25:3'>3</a> ).

David didn’t try to number all Israelites because they were too many (cf. <a ref='Genesis 28:14'>Ge 28:14</a> ).

David gave his personal fortune to the temple building, a fortune almost immeasurable. <a ref='1 Chronicles 29:1'>29:1</a> <b>young and inexperienced.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Chronicles 22:5'>1Chr 22:5</a> .</i> <a ref='1 Chronicles 29:4'>29:4</a> namely <b>, 3,000 talents.</b> Assuming a talent weighed about 75 lbs., this amounts to almost 112 tons of gold, plus the 7,000 talents of silver which would be 260 tons. The total worth of such precious metals has been estimated in the billions of dollars. <b>gold of Ophir.</b> This was held to be the purest and finest in the world (cf. <a ref='Job 22:24'>Job 22:24</a> ; <a ref='Job 28:16'>28:16</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 13:12'>Is 13:12</a> ). <a ref='1 Chronicles 29:6–9'>29:6–9</a> <b>willingly.</b> Here is the key to all freewill giving, i.e., giving what one desires to give. Tithes were required for taxation, to fund the theocracy, similar to taxation today. The law required that to be paid. This, however, is the voluntary giving from the heart to Yahweh. The NT speaks of this (cf. <a ref='Luke 6:38'>Lk 6:38</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 9:1–8'>2Co 9:1–8</a> ) and never demands that a tithe be given to God, but that taxes be paid to one’s government (cf. <a ref='Romans 13:6–7'>Ro 13:6–7</a> ). Paying taxes and giving God whatever one is willing to give, based on devotion to Him and His glory, is biblical giving. <a ref='1 Chronicles 29:7'>29:7</a> <b>gave 5,000 talents.</b> Assuming a talent weighed about 75 lbs., this amounts to 187 tons of gold. <b>darics.</b> A Persian coin, familiar to Jews from the captivity, possibly named after Darius I (cf. <a ref='Ezra 8:27'>Ezr 8:27</a> ).

The sum of all this is staggering, and has been estimated into the billions of dollars. <a ref='1 Chronicles 29:10–15'>29:10–15</a> David responds to the phenomenal offering expressing amazing sacrifices of wealth with praise in which he acknowledges that all things belong to and come from God. He concludes that God is everything and that man is nothing, much like <a ref='Ps 8'>Ps 8</a> . This magnificent prayer of thanks gives God all credit, even for the people’s generosity (v. <a ref='1 Chronicles 29:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='1 Chronicles 29:16–20'>29:16–20</a> David leads in a prayer of commitment. <a ref='1 Chronicles 29:17'>29:17</a> <b>try the heart.</b> Opportunities for giving to God are tests of the character of a believer’s devotion to Yahweh.
