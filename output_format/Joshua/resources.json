    "content": "The Book of Joshua Title This is the first of the 12 historical books, and it gained its name from the exploits of Joshua, the understudy whom Moses prayed for and commissioned as a leader in Israel ( <a ref='Numbers 27:12–23'>Nu 27:12–23</a> ). “Joshua” means “Jehovah saves,” or “the Lord is salvation,” and corresponds to the NT name “Jesus.” God delivered Israel in Joshua’s day when He was personally present as the saving Commander who fought on Israel’s behalf ( <a ref='Joshua 5:14–6:2'>5:14—6:2</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 10:42'>10:42</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 23:3'>23:3</a> , <a ref='Joshua 23:5'>5</a> ; <a ref='Acts 7:45'>Ac 7:45</a> ). Author and Date Although the author is not named, the most probable candidate is Joshua, who was the key eyewitness to the events recorded (cf. <a ref='Joshua 18:9'>18:9</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 24:26'>24:26</a> ). An assistant whom Joshua groomed could have finished the book by attaching such comments as those concerning Joshua’s death ( <a ref='Joshua 24:29–33'>24:29–33</a> ). Some have even suggested that this section was written by the High Priest Eleazar, or his son, Phinehas. Rahab was still living at the time <a ref='Joshua 6:25'>Jos 6:25</a> was penned. The book was completed before David’s reign ( <a ref='Joshua 15:63'>15:63</a> ; cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 5:5–9'>2Sa 5:5–9</a> ). The most likely writing period is ca. 1405–1385 BC. Joshua was born in Egyptian slavery, trained under Moses, and by God’s choice rose to his key position of leading Israel into Canaan. Distinguishing features of his life include: 1) service ( <a ref='Exodus 17:10'>Ex 17:10</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 24:13'>24:13</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 33:11'>33:11</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 11:28'>Nu 11:28</a> ); 2) soldiering ( <a ref='Exodus 17:9–13'>Ex 17:9–13</a> ); 3) scouting ( <a ref='Nu 13-14'>Nu 13–14</a> ); 4) supplication by Moses ( <a ref='Numbers 27:15–17'>Nu 27:15–17</a> ); 5) the sovereignty of God ( <a ref='Numbers 27:18'>Nu 27:18ff.</a> ); 6) the Spirit’s presence ( <a ref='Numbers 27:18'>Nu 27:18</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:9'>Dt 34:9</a> ); 7) separation by Moses ( <a ref='Numbers 27:18–23'>Nu 27:18–23</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:7–8'>Dt 31:7–8</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:13–15'>13–15</a> ); and 8) selflessness in wholly following the Lord ( <a ref='Numbers 32:12'>Nu 32:12</a> ). Background and Setting When Moses passed the baton of leadership on to Joshua before he died ( <a ref='De 34'>Dt 34</a> ), Israel was at the end of its 40 year wilderness wandering period ca. 1405 BC. Joshua was approaching 90 years of age when he became Israel’s leader. He later died at the age of 110 ( <a ref='Joshua 24:29'>24:29</a> ), having led Israel to drive out most of the Canaanites and having divided the land among the 12 tribes. Poised on the plains of Moab, east of the Jordan River and the land which God had promised ( <a ref='Genesis 12:7'>Ge 12:7</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 15:18–21'>15:18–21</a> ), the Israelites awaited God’s direction to conquer the land. They faced peoples on the western side of the Jordan who had become so steeped in iniquity that God would cause the land, so to speak, to spew out these inhabitants ( <a ref='Leviticus 18:24–25'>Lv 18:24–25</a> ). He would give Israel the land by conquest, primarily to fulfill the covenant He had pledged to Abraham and his descendants, but also to pass just judgment on the sinful inhabitants (cf. <a ref='Genesis 15:16'>Ge 15:16</a> ). Long possession of different parts of the land by various peoples had pre-dated even Abraham’s day ( <a ref='Genesis 10:15–19'>Ge 10:15–19</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 12:6'>12:6</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 13:7'>13:7</a> ). Its inhabitants had continued on a moral decline in the worship of many gods up to Joshua’s time. Historical and Theological Themes A keynote feature is God’s faithfulness to fulfill His promise of giving the Land to Abraham’s descendants ( <a ref='Genesis 12:7'>Ge 12:7</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 15:18–21'>15:18–21</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 17:8'>17:8</a> ). By His leading (cf. <a ref='Joshua 5:14–6:2'>5:14—6:2</a> ), they inhabited the territories east and west of the Jordan, and so the word “possess” appears nearly 20 times. Related to this theme is Israel’s failure to press their conquest to every part of the Land ( <a ref='Joshua 13:1'>13:1</a> ). <a ref='Jdg 1-2'>Judges 1–2</a> later describes the tragic results from this sin. Key verses focus on: 1) God’s promise of possession of the Land ( <a ref='Joshua 1:3'>1:3</a> , <a ref='Joshua 1:6'>6</a> ); 2) meditation on God’s law, which was strategic for His people ( <a ref='Joshua 1:8'>1:8</a> ); and 3) Israel’s actual possession of the Land in part ( <a ref='Joshua 11:23'>11:23</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 21:45'>21:45</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 22:4'>22:4</a> ). Specific allotment of distinct portions in the Land was Joshua’s task, as recorded in chaps. <a ref='Jos 13-22'>13–22</a> . Levites were placed strategically in 48 towns so that God’s spiritual services through them would be reasonably within reach of the Israelites, wherever they lived. God wanted His people to possess the Land: 1) to keep His promise ( <a ref='Genesis 12:7'>Ge 12:7</a> ); 2) to set the stage for later developments in His kingdom plan (cf. <a ref='Genesis 17:8'>Ge 17:8</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 49:8–12'>49:8–12</a> ), e.g., positioning Israel for events in the periods of the kings and prophets; 3) to punish peoples that were an affront to Him because of extreme sinfulness ( <a ref='Leviticus 18:25'>Lv 18:25</a> ); and 4) to be a testimony to other peoples ( <a ref='Joshua 2:9–11'>Jos 2:9–11</a> ), as God’s covenant heart reached out to all nations ( <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> ). Interpretive Challenges Miracles always challenge readers either to believe that the God who created heaven and earth ( <a ref='Genesis 1:1'>Ge 1:1</a> ) can do other mighty works, too, or to explain them away. As in Moses’ day, miracles in this book were a part of God’s purpose, such as: 1) His holding back the Jordan’s waters ( <a ref='Joshua 3:7–17'>Jos 3:7–17</a> ); 2) the fall of Jericho’s walls ( <a ref='Joshua 6:1–27'>Jos 6:1–27</a> ); 3) the hailstones ( <a ref='Joshua 10:1–11'>Jos 10:1–11</a> ); and 4) the long day ( <a ref='Joshua 10:12–15'>Jos 10:12–15</a> ). Other challenges include: 1) How did God’s blessing on the harlot Rahab, who responded to Him in faith, relate to her telling a lie ( <a ref='Jos 2'>Jos 2</a> )?; 2) Why were Achan’s family members executed with him ( <a ref='Jos 7'>Jos 7</a> )?; 3) Why was Ai, with fewer men than Israel, hard to conquer ( <a ref='Jos 7-8'>Jos 7–8</a> )?; 4) What does God’s sending “the hornet” before Israel mean ( <a ref='Joshua 24:12'>Jos 24:12</a> )? These questions will be addressed in the notes. Outline I. Entering the Promised Land ( <a ref='Joshua 1:1–5:15'>1:1—5:15</a> ) II.

The parts of Scripture they possessed have always been the main spiritual food of those who served Him, e.g., Job ( <a ref='Job 23:12'>Job 23:12</a> ); the psalmist ( <a ref='Psalms 1:1–3'>Ps 1:1–3</a> ); Jeremiah ( <a ref='Jeremiah 15:16'>Jer 15:16</a> ); and Jesus ( <a ref='John 4:34'>Jn 4:34</a> ). <b>successful … prosperous.</b> The promise of God’s blessing on the great responsibility God has given Joshua. The principle here is central to all spiritual effort and enterprise, namely the deep understanding and application of Scripture at all times. <a ref='Joshua 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>Yahweh … is with you.</b> This assurance has always been the staying sufficiency for His servants such as: Abraham ( <a ref='Genesis 15:1'>Ge 15:1</a> ); Moses and his people ( <a ref='Exodus 14:13'>Ex 14:13</a> ); Isaiah ( <a ref='Isaiah 41:10'>Is 41:10</a> ); Jeremiah ( <a ref='Jeremiah 1:7–8'>Jer 1:7–8</a> ); and Christians through the centuries ( <a ref='Matthew 28:20'>Mt 28:20</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 13:5'>Heb 13:5</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>within three days.</b> In some cases, events which took place before this announcement and these 3 days (cf. <a ref='Joshua 3:2'>3:2</a> ) are described later on, e.g., Joshua’s sending two scouts to check out the Land ( <a ref='Joshua 2:22'>2:22</a> ). Joshua’s Preparation for Ministry 1. <a ref='Exodus 17:9–10'>Ex 17:9–10</a> , <a ref='Exodus 17:13–14'>13–14</a> Joshua led the victorious battle against the Amalekites. 2. <a ref='Exodus 24:13'>Ex 24:13</a> Joshua, the servant of Moses, accompanied the Jewish leader to the mountain of God (cf. <a ref='Exodus 32:17'>32:17</a> ). 3. <a ref='Numbers 11:28'>Nu 11:28</a> Joshua was the attendant of Moses from his youth. 4. <a ref='Numbers 13:16'>Nu 13:16</a> Moses changed his name from Hoshea (“salvation”) to Joshua (“the Lord saves”). 5. <a ref='Numbers 14:6–10'>Nu 14:6–10</a> , <a ref='Numbers 14:30'>30</a> , <a ref='Numbers 14:38'>38</a> Joshua, along with Caleb, spied out the land of Canaan with 10 others. Only Joshua and Caleb urged the nation to possess the land and, thus, only they of the 12 actually entered Canaan. 6. <a ref='Numbers 27:18'>Nu 27:18</a> Joshua was indwelt by the Holy Spirit. 7. <a ref='Numbers 27:18–23'>Nu 27:18–23</a> Joshua was commissioned for spiritual service the first time, to assist Moses. 8. <a ref='Numbers 32:12'>Nu 32:12</a> Joshua followed the Lord fully. 9. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:23'>Dt 31:23</a> Joshua was commissioned a second time, to replace Moses. 10. <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:9'>Dt 34:9</a> Joshua was filled with the spirit of wisdom. Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Joshua 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>half-tribe of Manasseh.</b> In <a ref='Ge 48'>Ge 48</a> Jacob blessed both sons of Joseph, Ephraim, and Manasseh, so that Joseph actually received a double blessing ( <a ref='Genesis 48:22'>Ge 48:22</a> ). This allowed for 12 allotments of the land, Levi being excluded because of priestly function. <a ref='Joshua 1:13–18'>1:13–18</a> <b>Yahweh … will give you this land.</b> God gave them these lands directly across the Jordan River on the east (cf. <a ref='Nu 32'>Nu 32</a> ). Yet, it was their duty to assist the other tribes of Israel to invade and conquer their allotted land to the west. <a ref='Joshua 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>two men as spies.</b> These scouts would inform Joshua on various features of the topography, food, drinking water, and defenses to be overcome in the invasion. <b>Shittim … Jericho.</b> The grove (cf. <a ref='Joshua 3:1'>3:1</a> ) was situated in foothills about 7 mi. east of the Jordan, and Jericho lay seven mi. west of the river. <b>house of a harlot.</b> Their purpose was not impure; rather, the spies sought a place where they would not be conspicuous. Resorting to such a house would be a good cover, from where they might learn something of Jericho. Also, a house on the city wall (v. <a ref='Joshua 2:15'>15</a> ) would allow a quick getaway. In spite of this precaution, their presence became known (vv. <a ref='Joshua 2:2–3'>2–3</a> ). God, in His sovereign providence, wanted them there for the salvation of the harlot. She would provide an example of His saving by faith a woman at the bottom of the social strata, as He saved Abraham at the top (cf. <a ref='James 2:18–25'>Jas 2:18–25</a> ). Most importantly, by God’s grace she was in the Messianic line ( <a ref='Matthew 1:5'>Mt 1:5</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>the king.</b> He was not over a broad domain, but only the city-state. Kings over other city areas appear later during this conquest (cf. <a ref='Joshua 8:23'>8:23</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 12:24'>12:24</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 2:4–5'>2:4–5</a> Cf. vv. <a ref='Joshua 2:9–11'>9–11</a> . Lying is sin to God ( <a ref='Exodus 20:16'>Ex 20:16</a> ), for He cannot lie ( <a ref='Titus 1:2'>Tit 1:2</a> ). God commended her faith ( <a ref='Hebrews 11:31'>Heb 11:31</a> ; <a ref='James 2:25'>Jas 2:25</a> ) as expressed in vv. <a ref='James 2:9–16'>9–16</a> , not her lie. He never condones any sin, yet none are without some sin (cf. <a ref='Romans 3:23'>Ro 3:23</a> ), thus the need for forgiveness. But He also honors true faith, small as it is, and imparts saving grace ( <a ref='Exodus 34:7'>Ex 34:7</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 2:6'>2:6</a> <b>stalks of flax.</b> These fibers, used for making linen, were stems about 3 feet long, left to sit in water, then piled in the sun or on a level roof to dry. <a ref='Joshua 2:11'>2:11</a> <b>God in heaven above and on earth beneath.</b> She confessed the realization that He is the sovereign Creator and Sustainer of all that exists (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:39'>Dt 4:39</a> ; <a ref='Acts 14:15'>Ac 14:15</a> ; <a ref='Acts 17:23–28'>17:23–28</a> ), thus the Supreme One. <a ref='Joshua 2:15–16'>2:15–16</a> Her home was on the city wall, with the Jordan (v. <a ref='Joshua 2:7'>7</a> ) to the east. The rugged mountains to the west provided many hiding places. <a ref='Joshua 2:18'>2:18</a> <b>cord.</b> A different word from “rope” (v. <a ref='Joshua 2:15'>15</a> ). Scarlet, unlike drab green, brown, gray, etc., is better seen to mark the house for protection. The color also is fitting for these whose blood (v. <a ref='Joshua 2:19'>19</a> ) was under God’s pledge of safety. <a ref='Joshua 3:3'>3:3</a> <b>the ark.</b> Symbolized God’s presence going before His people. Kohathites customarily carried the ark ( <a ref='Numbers 4:15'>Nu 4:15</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 7:9'>7:9</a> ), but in this unusual case the Levitical priests transported it, as in <a ref='Joshua 6:6'>Jos 6:6</a> and <a ref='1 Kings 8:3–6'>1Ki 8:3–6</a> . <a ref='Joshua 3:4'>3:4</a> <b>2,000 cubits.</b> 1,000 yards. <a ref='Joshua 3:8'>3:8</a> <b>stand … in the Jordan.</b> The priests were to stand there to permit time for God’s words (v. <a ref='Joshua 3:9'>9</a> ) to stimulate reflection on the greatness of God’s eminent action in giving the Land as He showed His presence (v. <a ref='Joshua 3:10'>10</a> ). Also, it was a preparation to allow the people following to get set for God’s miracle which stopped the waters for a crossing (vv. <a ref='Joshua 3:13–17'>13–17</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 3:10'>3:10</a> Canaanite people to be killed or defeated were sinful to the point of extreme (cf. <a ref='Genesis 15:16'>Ge 15:16</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 18:24–25'>Lv 18:24–25</a> ). God, as moral judge, has the right to deal with all people, as at the end ( <a ref='Revelation 20:11–15'>Rev 20:11–15</a> ) or any other time when He deems it appropriate for His purposes. The question is not why God chose to destroy these sinners, but why He had let them live so long, and why all sinners are not destroyed far sooner than they are. It is grace that allows any sinner to draw one more breath of life (cf. <a ref='Genesis 2:17'>Ge 2:17</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 18:20'>Eze 18:20</a> ; <a ref='Romans 6:23'>Ro 6:23</a> ).

Ammonites The descendants of Ammon, the grandson of Lot by his youngest daughter ( <a ref='Genesis 19:38'>Ge 19:38</a> ), who lived east of the Jordan River and north of Moab. 3. Amorites A general term for the inhabitants of the Land, but especially for the descendants of Canaan who inhabited the hill country on both sides of the Jordan. 4. Canaanites Broadly speaking, these are the descendants of Canaan, son of Ham, son of Noah (cf. <a ref='Genesis 10:15–18'>Ge 10:15–18</a> ), and included many of the other groups named here. 5. Edomites The descendants of Esau who settled southeast of Palestine (cf. <a ref='Genesis 25:30'>Ge 25:30</a> ) in the land of Seir. 6. Gebalites People of the ancient seaport later known as Byblos, about 20 mi. north of modern Beirut ( <a ref='Joshua 13:5'>Jos 13:5</a> ). 7. Geshurites The inhabitants of Geshur, east of the Jordan and to the south of Syria ( <a ref='Joshua 12:5'>Jos 12:5</a> ). 8. Gibeonites The inhabitants of Gibeon and surrounding area ( <a ref='Joshua 9:17'>Jos 9:17</a> ). 9. Girgashites A tribe descended from Canaan, which was included among the general population of the Land without specific geographical identity. 10. Girzites An obscure group which lived in the northwestern part of the Negev, before they were destroyed by David ( <a ref='1 Samuel 27:8–9'>1Sa 27:8–9</a> ). 11. Hittites Immigrants from the Hittite Empire (in the region of Syria) to the central region of the Land (cf. <a ref='Genesis 23:10'>Ge 23:10</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 11:3'>2Sa 11:3</a> ). 12. Hivites Descendants of Canaan who lived in the northern reaches of the Land. 13. Horites Ancient residents of Edom from an unknown origin who were destroyed by Esau’s descendants ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:22'>Dt 2:22</a> ). 14. Jebusites Descendants of Canaan who dwelt in the hill country around Jerusalem (cf. <a ref='Genesis 15:21'>Ge 15:21</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 3:8'>Ex 3:8</a> ). 15. Kenites A Midianite tribe that originally dwelt in the Gulf of Aqabah region ( <a ref='1 Samuel 27:10'>1Sa 27:10</a> ). 16. Moabites The descendants of Moab, the grandson of Lot by his eldest daughter ( <a ref='Genesis 19:37'>Ge 19:37</a> ), who lived east of the Dead Sea. 17. Perizzites People included among the general population of the Land who do not trace their lineage to Canaan. Their exact identity is uncertain. Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Joshua 3:16'>3:16</a> <b>rose up in one heap.</b> The God of all power, who created heaven, earth, and all else according to <a ref='Ge 1'>Ge 1</a> , worked miracles here. The waters were dammed up at Adam, a city 15 mi. north of the crossing, and also in tributary creeks. Once the miracle was completed, God permitted waters to flow again ( <a ref='Joshua 4:18'>4:18</a> ) after all the people had walked to the other side on dry ground ( <a ref='Joshua 3:17'>3:17</a> ). As the Exodus had begun (cf. <a ref='Ex 14'>Ex 14</a> ), so it ended. <a ref='Joshua 4:1–8'>4:1–8</a> Twelve stones picked up from the riverbed became a memorial to God’s faithfulness. They were set up at Gilgal (about 1 1/4 mi. from Jericho), which was Israel’s first campsite in the invaded land (vv. <a ref='Joshua 4:19–20'>19–20</a> ). Placing 12 stones in the riverbed itself commemorated the place which God dried up, where His ark had been held, and where He showed by a miracle His mighty presence and worthiness of respect (vv. <a ref='Joshua 4:9–11'>9–11</a> , <a ref='Joshua 4:21–24'>21–24</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 4:19'>4:19</a> <b>tenth of the first month.</b> March-April.

The miracle was all the more incredible and shocking since God performed it when the Jordan was swollen to flood height ( <a ref='Joshua 3:15'>3:15</a> ). To the people in the Land, this miracle was a powerful demonstration proving that God is mighty ( <a ref='Joshua 4:24'>4:24</a> ). This came on top of reports about the Red Sea miracle ( <a ref='Joshua 2:10'>2:10</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 5:2'>5:2</a> <b>circumcise.</b> God commanded Joshua to see that this was done to all males under 40.

He came as the Angel (Messenger) of Yahweh, as if He were a man (cf. the one of 3 “angels,” <a ref='Ge 18'>Ge 18</a> ). Joshua fittingly was reverent in worship. The captain, sword drawn, showed a posture indicating He was set to give Israel victory over the Canaanites ( <a ref='Joshua 6:2'>6:2</a> ; cf. <a ref='Joshua 1:3'>1:3</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 6:1'>6:1</a> <b>Jericho.</b> The city was fortified by a double ring of walls, the outer 6 ft. thick and the inner 12; timbers were laid across these, supporting houses on the walls. Since Jericho was built on a hill, it could be taken only by mounting a steep incline, which put the Israelites at a great disadvantage. Attackers of such a “fortress” often used a siege of several months to force surrender through starvation. <a ref='Joshua 6:3–21'>6:3–21</a> The bizarre military strategy of marching around Jericho gave occasion for the Israelites to take God at His promise (v. <a ref='Joshua 6:2'>2</a> ). They would also heighten the defenders’ uneasiness. Seven is sometimes a number used to signify completeness (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 5:10'>2Ki 5:10</a> , <a ref='2 Kings 5:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 6:5'>6:5</a> God assured Israel of an astounding miracle, just as He had done at the Jordan. <a ref='Joshua 6:16'>6:16</a> The loud shout in unison expressed an expectation of God’s action to fulfill His guaranteed promise (vv. <a ref='Joshua 6:2'>2</a> , <a ref='Joshua 6:5'>5</a> , <a ref='Joshua 6:16'>16</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 6:17'>6:17</a> <b>devoted to destruction.</b> The Hebrew term means “utterly destroyed,” as in v. <a ref='Joshua 6:21'>21</a> ; i.e., to ban or devote as spoil for a deity.

The part of the wall securing this house must not have fallen, and all possessions in the dwelling were safe. <a ref='Joshua 6:26'>6:26</a> God put a curse on whoever would rebuild Jericho. While the area around it was later occupied to some extent ( <a ref='2 Samuel 10:5'>2Sa 10:5</a> ), in Ahab’s reign Hiel rebuilt Jericho and experienced the curse by losing his eldest and youngest sons ( <a ref='1 Kings 16:34'>1Ki 16:34</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 6:27'>6:27</a> God kept His pledge that He would be with Joshua ( <a ref='Joshua 1:5–9'>1:5–9</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 7:1–5'>7:1–5</a> Israel’s defeat here is similar to an earlier setback against the Amalekites ( <a ref='Numbers 14:39–45'>Nu 14:39–45</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 7:2'>7:2</a> <b>Ai.</b> A town situated west of the Jordan, in the hills east of Bethel (cf. <a ref='Genesis 12:8'>Ge 12:8</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 7:3'>7:3</a> <b>few.</b> The “few” inhabitants of Ai are numbered at 12,000 in <a ref='Joshua 8:25'>8:25</a> (cf. <a ref='Joshua 8:3'>8:3</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 7:9'>7:9</a> <b>what will You do for Your great name?</b> The main issue is the glory and honor of God (cf.

Possibly the raising was even a signal of confidence in God: “for I will give it into your hand.” Earlier, Moses’ uplifted rod and arms probably signified trusting contact with God for victory over Amalek ( <a ref='Exodus 17:8–13'>Ex 17:8–13</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 8:29'>8:29</a> <b>the king of Ai.</b> The complete execution of Ai’s populace included hanging even the king.

This carried out the vengeance of God on His enemies. <a ref='Joshua 8:30–35'>8:30–35</a> This ceremony took place in obedience to <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:1–26'>Dt 27:1–26</a> at the conclusion of Joshua’s central campaign (cf. <a ref='Joshua 6:1–8:35'>6:1—8:35</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 8:30–31'>8:30–31</a> Thanks is offered to God for giving victory.

It was a strong city with capable fighting men ( <a ref='Joshua 10:2'>10:2</a> ). Three other towns were in league with it ( <a ref='Joshua 9:17'>9:17</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 9:4–15'>9:4–15</a> The Gibeonite plot to trick Israel worked. Israel’s sinful failure occurred because they were not vigilant in prayer to assure that they acted by God’s counsel (v. <a ref='Joshua 9:14'>14</a> ; cf. <a ref='Proverbs 3:5–6'>Pr 3:5–6</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 9:15'>9:15</a> Israel precipitously made peace with the Gibeonites ( <a ref='Joshua 11:19'>11:19</a> ) who lived nearby, even though God had instructed them to eliminate the people of cities in the Land ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:1–2'>Dt 7:1–2</a> ). God permitted peace with cities outside ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:11–15'>Dt 20:11–15</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 9:21–23'>9:21–23</a> While honoring the pledge of peace with the Gibeonites (v. <a ref='Joshua 9:19'>19</a> ), Joshua made them woodcutters and water carriers because of the deception. This curse extended the perpetual (v. <a ref='Joshua 9:23'>23</a> ) part of “let Canaan be his servant” ( <a ref='Genesis 9:26'>Ge 9:26</a> ). Gibeon became a part of Benjamin’s land area ( <a ref='Joshua 18:25'>Jos 18:25</a> ). Later, Joshua consigned Gibeon as one of the Levite towns ( <a ref='Joshua 21:17'>21:17</a> ). Nehemiah had help from some Gibeonites in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem ( <a ref='Nehemiah 3:7'>Ne 3:7</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 10:1–11'>10:1–11</a> Gibeon and 3 other towns ( <a ref='Joshua 9:17'>9:17</a> ) were attacked by a coalition of 5 cities. Israel came to the rescue, with God giving the victory (v. <a ref='Joshua 10:10'>10</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 10:11'>10:11</a> The hailstones were miraculous. Note their: 1) source, God; 2) size, large; 3) slaughter, more by stones than by sword; 4) selectivity, only on the enemy; 5) swath, “as far as Azekah”; 6) situation, during a trek down a slope and while God caused the sun to stand still; and 7) similarity to miraculous stones God will fling down during the future wrath ( <a ref='Revelation 16:21'>Rev 16:21</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 10:12–14'>10:12–14</a> <b>sun stood still, and the moon stopped.</b> Some say an eclipse hid the sun, keeping its heat from Joshua’s worn soldiers and allowing coolness for battle. Others suppose a local (not universal) refraction of the sun’s rays such as the local darkness in Egypt ( <a ref='Exodus 10:21–23'>Ex 10:21–23</a> ). Another view has it as only language of observation; i.e., it only seemed to Joshua’s men that the sun and moon stopped as God helped them do in one literal 24-hour day what would normally take longer. Others view it as lavish poetic description, not literal fact. However, such ideas fail to do justice to <a ref='Joshua 10:12–14'>10:12–14</a> , and needlessly question God’s power as Creator. This is best accepted as an outright, monumental miracle. Joshua, moved by Yahweh’s will, commanded the sun to delay (Hebrew, “be still, silent, leave off”). The earth actually stopped rotating or, more likely, the sun moved in the same way to keep perfect pace with the battlefield. The moon also ceased its orbiting. This permitted Joshua’s troops time to finish the battle with complete victory (v. <a ref='Joshua 10:11'>11</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 10:13–15'>10:13–15</a> <b>book of Jashar.</b> <i>Jashar</i> means “upright.” It may be the same as the book called Wars of Yahweh ( <a ref='Numbers 21:14'>Nu 21:14</a> ).

Later, he conquered the area ( <a ref='Joshua 15:13–14'>15:13–14</a> ) and conferred blessing on Othniel and his daughter ( <a ref='Joshua 15:15–19'>15:15–19</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 14:10'>14:10</a> <b>eighty-five years old.</b> Given 1) that Caleb was 40 at Kadesh-barnea and 2) that the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness 38 years, then the conquering of the Land took 7 years (ca. 1405–1398 BC), Caleb was now 85 years old. <a ref='Joshua 14:12–14'>14:12–14</a> Based on His promise (v. <a ref='Joshua 14:9'>9</a> ), God granted Caleb’s desire for Hebron because of his faithfulness to believe that God would give the Land to the Israelites as He promised. <a ref='Joshua 14:15'>14:15</a> <b>Anakim.</b> See <a ref='Joshua 15:13'>15:13</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Joshua 11:21'>11:21</a></i> . <a ref='Joshua 15:1–12'>15:1–12</a> <b>the lot for … Judah.</b> The tribe’s southern boundary (v. <a ref='Joshua 15:1'>1</a> ) ran from the lower tip of the Salt or Dead Sea in a sweep through the desert over to the Wadi, the brook of Egypt ( <i>see note on <a ref='Joshua 13:3'>13:3</a></i> ), and along it to the Mediterranean. The eastern limit (v. <a ref='Joshua 15:5'>5</a> ) ran the length of the Salt Sea itself. On the north, it extended from the north end of the Salt Sea by various lines working to the Mediterranean (vv. <a ref='Joshua 15:5–11'>5–11</a> ). The Mediterranean coastline served as the western border (v. <a ref='Joshua 15:12'>12</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 15:17'>15:17</a> <b>Othniel.</b> A conqueror like Caleb, who was his father-in-law, he would later be a judge in Israel ( <a ref='Judges 3:9–11'>Jdg 3:9–11</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 15:18–19'>15:18–19</a> Caleb’s daughter sought blessing and exercised real faith for it—like father, like daughter. <a ref='Joshua 15:20–62'>15:20–62</a> <b>the inheritance of … Judah.</b> Judah’s cities are grouped in 4 areas: south (vv. <a ref='Joshua 15:20–32'>20–32</a> ); Shephelah or foothills over near the Mediterranean (vv. <a ref='Joshua 15:33–47'>33–47</a> ); hilly central region (vv. <a ref='Joshua 15:48–60'>48–60</a> ); Judean wilderness dropping eastward down to the Dead Sea (vv. <a ref='Joshua 15:61–62'>61–62</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 15:63'>15:63</a> <b>Jebusites.</b> The inhabitants of Jerusalem were descendants from the third son of Canaan ( <a ref='Genesis 10:15–16'>Ge 10:15–16</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 15:21'>15:21</a> ). Joshua killed their king who had joined a pact against Gibeon ( <a ref='Jos 10'>Jos 10</a> ). Israelites called the area “Jebus” until David ordered Joab and his soldiers to capture the city ( <a ref='2 Samuel 5:6–7'>2Sa 5:6–7</a> ) and made it his capital. <a ref='Judges 1:8'>Judges 1:8</a> , <a ref='Judges 1:21'>21</a> show that the Israelites conquered Jebus and burned it, but the Jebusites later regained control until David’s day. Melchizedek had been a very early king ( <a ref='Ge 14'>Ge 14</a> ), a believer in the true God, when the site was “Salem” (cf. <a ref='Psalms 76:2'>Ps 76:2</a> , “Salem” is “Jerusalem”). <a ref='Joshua 16:1–4'>16:1–4</a> <b>sons of Joseph.</b> Joseph’s territory was double as it was given to his sons Manasseh and Ephraim, who had inheritances stretching over a good portion of the central area in the Promised Land. <a ref='Joshua 16:5–9'>16:5–9</a> <b>territory of … Ephraim.</b> The description is of the land north of Judah’s territory, from the Jordan west to the Mediterranean Sea. There was the inclusion of some cities in the territory of Manasseh, since Ephraim’s land was small compared to its population. <a ref='Joshua 16:10'>16:10</a> Ephraim did not drive the Canaanites from their area. This is the first mention of the fatal policy of neglecting to exterminate the idolaters (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:16'>Dt 20:16</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 17:1–18'>17:1–18</a> <b>Manasseh.</b> The other half-tribe of Manasseh, distinct from the half in <a ref='Joshua 16:4'>16:4</a> , received its portion of the split inheritance west of the Jordan to the north and east near the Lake of Chinneroth (Galilee). <a ref='Joshua 17:3–6'>17:3–6</a> <b>Zelophehad.</b> In Manasseh’s tribe, this man had no sons as heirs, but his 5 daughters received the inheritance. God led Moses to give this right to women ( <a ref='Numbers 27:1–11'>Nu 27:1–11</a> , cited in v. <a ref='Joshua 17:4'>4</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 17:12–18'>17:12–18</a> <b>sons of Manasseh.</b> Tribesmen of Manasseh complained that Joshua did not allot them land sufficient to their numbers and that the Canaanites were too tough for them to drive out altogether. He permitted them extra land in forested hills that they could clear. Joshua told them that they could drive out the Canaanites for God had promised to be with them in victory against chariots ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:1'>Dt 20:1</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 18:1'>18:1</a> <b>Shiloh.</b> Israel as a whole, having had their camp first at Gilgal ( <a ref='Joshua 4:20'>4:20</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 5:9'>5:9</a> ), converged to Shiloh for worship at the tabernacle. Shiloh, about 9 mi. north of Bethel and 20 mi. north of Jerusalem, remained the center of spiritual attention, as in <a ref='Judges 18:31'>Jdg 18:31</a> and <a ref='1 Samuel 1:3'>1Sa 1:3</a> . Due to Israel’s sin, God would later let the Philistines devastate Israel at Shiloh and capture the ark ( <a ref='1 Samuel 4:10'>1Sa 4:10</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 4:17'>17</a> ), and He would later use Shiloh as an example of judgment ( <a ref='Jeremiah 7:12'>Jer 7:12</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 18:8'>18:8</a> , <a ref='Joshua 18:10'>10</a> Seven tribes were yet to receive land (v. <a ref='Joshua 18:2'>2</a> ). Joshua obtained from their 21 surveyor scouts (vv. <a ref='Joshua 18:2–4'>2–4</a> ) descriptions of the 7 areas of land, then cast lots to decide the choices. The High Priest Eleazar served him, seeking God’s will by casting lots ( <a ref='Joshua 19:51'>19:51</a> ). This was not some act of mere chance, but a means God used to reveal His will ( <i>see note on <a ref='Proverbs 16:33'>Pr 16:33</a></i> ). <a ref='Joshua 18:11–28'>18:11–28</a> <b>the lot of … Benjamin.</b> This inheritance lay between Judah’s and Ephraim’s, and embraced Jerusalem (v. <a ref='Joshua 18:28'>28</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 19:1–9'>19:1–9</a> <b>Simeon.</b> This area was a southern portion of Judah’s territory, since that allotment was more than Judah needed (v. <a ref='Joshua 19:9'>9</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 19:10–16'>19:10–16</a> <b>Zebulun.</b> This allotment lay west of the Lake of Chinneroth (Sea of Galilee) and ran to the Mediterranean Sea. <a ref='Joshua 19:17–23'>19:17–23</a> <b>Issachar.</b> The area basically ran just below the Sea of Galilee from the Jordan west over to Mt. Tabor, circling southwest almost to Megiddo, north of Manasseh’s portion. <a ref='Joshua 19:24–31'>19:24–31</a> <b>Asher.</b> This territory was a long, broad strip flanking the Mediterranean on the west, then Naphtali’s and Zebulun’s claims on the east, running south to Manasseh’s. It reached from Mt. Carmel in the south to the area of Tyre in the north. <a ref='Joshua 19:32–39'>19:32–39</a> <b>Naphtali.</b> This region took in a long stretch of land with a border at the northern edge of all the Israelite inheritances, a line on the west dividing it from Asher, southward to follow Zebulun’s northern border. Then it struck eastward toward the Sea of Galilee with land to the west alongside that sea and down to Issachar’s claim, over to the Jordan River. The eastern line ran northward, including the city of Hazor and also Dan, then swung north of Dan. Jesus’ Galilean ministry would take place largely in this area ( <a ref='Isaiah 9:1–2'>Is 9:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 4:13–17'>Mt 4:13–17</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 19:33'>19:33</a> <b>oak.</b> This may have been an oak forest (if taken in a collective sense, as the word possibly means in <a ref='Genesis 12:6'>Ge 12:6</a> ) near Kedesh and northwest of the waters at Merom. According to <a ref='Judges 4:11'>Jdg 4:11</a> , it was the site where Jael killed Sisera with a hammer and tent peg ( <a ref='Judges 4:21'>4:21</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 19:40–48'>19:40–48</a> <b>Dan.</b> The tribal allotment was a narrow, roughly U-shaped strip just north of Judah’s claim and south of Ephraim’s. The Mediterranean coast lay on the western arm of the “U.” Joppa was on the coast near the north end. Later the Danites, failing to possess their original claim ( <a ref='Judges 1:34–36'>Jdg 1:34–36</a> ), migrated northeastward to a territory by Laish or Leshem ( <a ref='Joshua 19:47'>Jos 19:47</a> ). They conquered this area north of the Sea of Galilee and Hazor, and renamed it Dan ( <a ref='Joshua 19:47–48'>Jos 19:47–48</a> ; <a ref='Judges 18:27–29'>Jdg 18:27–29</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 19:49–50'>19:49–50</a> Joshua received his own inheritance from the children of Israel, an area he preferred in the hills of his tribe, Ephraim ( <a ref='Numbers 13:8'>Nu 13:8</a> ). He built a city, Timnath-serah, about 16 mi. southwest of Shechem. His inheritance was an intrinsic part of God’s promise to him, as was also Caleb’s inheritance ( <a ref='Numbers 14:30'>Nu 14:30</a> ). Cities of Refuge Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Joshua 20:2–9'>20:2–9</a> <b>cities of refuge.</b> Moses had spoken God’s Word to name 6 cities in Israel as refuge centers. A person who inadvertently killed another could flee to the nearest of these for protection (cf. <a ref='Numbers 35:9–34'>Nu 35:9–34</a> ). Three lay west of the Jordan, and 3 lay to the east, each reachable in a day for those in its area. The slayer could flee there to escape pursuit by a family member seeking to exact private justice. Authorities at the refuge protected him and escorted him to a trial. If found innocent, he was guarded at the refuge until the death of the current High Priest, a kind of statute of limitations ( <a ref='Joshua 20:6'>Jos 20:6</a> ). He could then return home. If found guilty of murder, he suffered due punishment. <a ref='Joshua 21:1–3'>21:1–3</a> <b>cities to live in.</b> God had given Moses His direction to provide 48 cities for the Levites, dotted throughout Israel’s tribal allotments ( <a ref='Numbers 35:1–8'>Nu 35:1–8</a> ). Six were to be the cities of refuge ( <a ref='Numbers 35:6'>Nu 35:6</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 21:3–42'>21:3–42</a> <b>the sons of Israel gave the Levites.</b> These 48 cities (v. <a ref='Joshua 21:41'>41</a> ) are for various branches of the Levite people to live in and have pasture for their livestock (v. <a ref='Joshua 21:42'>42</a> ). People of the other tribes donated the areas, each site giving the Levites a vantage point from which to minister spiritually to the people nearby. In fairness, larger tribes devoted more land, smaller ones less ( <a ref='Numbers 35:8'>Nu 35:8</a> ). Only the Kohathites were priests, with other branches of Levites assisting in various roles of ritual worship and manual labors. <a ref='Joshua 21:4'>21:4</a> <b>Kohathites.</b> Under God’s guiding wisdom, these received 13 city areas in the vicinity of Jerusalem or at a reasonable distance within allotments of Judah, Benjamin, and Simeon. This would give them access to carry out priestly functions where God would later have the ark moved and the temple situated ( <a ref='2Sa 6'>2Sa 6</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 21:43–45'>21:43–45</a> <b>So Yahweh gave Israel all the land.</b> This sums up God’s fulfillment of His covenant promise to give Abraham’s people the Land ( <a ref='Genesis 12:7'>Ge 12:7</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 1:2'>Jos 1:2</a> , <a ref='Joshua 1:5–9'>5–9</a> ). God also kept His Word in giving the people rest ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:9–10'>Dt 12:9–10</a> ). In a valid sense, the Canaanites were in check, under military conquest as God had pledged ( <a ref='Joshua 1:5'>Jos 1:5</a> ), not posing an immediate threat. Not every enemy had been driven out, however, leaving some to stir up trouble later. But God’s people failed to exercise their responsibility and possess their land to the full degree in various areas. <a ref='Joshua 22:1'>22:1</a> <b>Reubenites … Gadites … Manasseh.</b> The tribes from east of the Jordan had helped their people conquer the land west of the river. Now they were ready to go back to their families to the east. <a ref='Joshua 22:4'>22:4</a> <b>Moses … gave you.</b> Clearance from Moses and Joshua for these tribes to possess land east of the Jordan was of God (v. <a ref='Joshua 22:9'>9</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 24:8'>24:8</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 32:30–33'>Nu 32:30–33</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 22:10–34'>22:10–34</a> <b>an altar … by the Jordan.</b> The special altar built by the 2 1/2 tribes near the river, though well-meant, aroused suspicions among western tribes. They feared rebellion against the Shiloh altar that served all the tribes in unity. When challenged, men of the eastern tribes explained their motives to follow the true God, be in unity with the rest of Israel, and not be regarded as outsiders. The explanation met with other Israelites’ approval. <a ref='Joshua 23:1'>23:1</a> <b>Joshua was old.</b> A long time had passed since he led the conquest ca. 1405–1398 BC; Joshua had grown very old, and was 110 when he died ( <a ref='Joshua 24:29'>24:29</a> ), ca. 1385–1383 BC ( <i>see note on <a ref='Joshua 13:1'>13:1</a></i> ). <a ref='Joshua 23:5'>23:5</a> <b>And Yahweh … will thrust them out.</b> God was ready to help His people drive the remaining Canaanites out so that they could possess their claims more fully. Such moves needed to be gradual ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:22'>Dt 7:22</a> ), but determined, in obedience to God. <a ref='Joshua 23:7–8'>23:7–8</a> The dangers from being incomplete about possessing all the land included that of intermingling with the godless, as in marriages (v. <a ref='Joshua 23:12'>12</a> ), and committing to their gods, thus drifting from worshiping the true God. The Canaanites would become snares, traps, scourges, and thorns, causing Israelites to eventually lose the Land (vv. <a ref='Joshua 23:13'>13</a> , <a ref='Joshua 23:15–16'>15–16</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 23:15–16'>23:15–16</a> This actually occurred 800 years later, when Babylon exiled the Israelites ca. 605–586 BC (cf. <a ref='2Ki 24-25'>2Ki 24–25</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 24:1–25'>24:1–25</a> It was time for worship and thanksgiving for all God had done leading up to and including the conquest of Canaan. <a ref='Joshua 24:1–5'>24:1–5</a> Joshua reviewed the history recorded in <a ref='Ge 11'>Ge 11</a> to <a ref='Ex 15'>Ex 15</a> . <a ref='Joshua 24:2'>24:2</a> <b>the River.</b> The Euphrates, where Abraham’s family had lived. It is clear here that God’s calling of Abraham out to Himself was also a call out of idolatry, as He does with others (cf. <a ref='1 Thessalonians 1:9'>1Th 1:9</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 24:6–13'>24:6–13</a> Joshua reviewed the history recorded in <a ref='Ex 12'>Ex 12</a> to <a ref='Jos 22'>Jos 22</a> . <a ref='Joshua 24:8'>24:8</a> , <a ref='Joshua 24:15'>15</a> <b>Amorites.</b> Sometimes this is used as a general term for the entire pagan populace (cf. v. <a ref='Joshua 24:11'>11</a> ) in Canaan, as elsewhere ( <a ref='Genesis 15:16'>Ge 15:16</a> ; <a ref='Judges 1:34–35'>Jdg 1:34–35</a> ). At other times, the name has a narrower reference to people of the hill country ( <a ref='Numbers 13:29'>Nu 13:29</a> ), distinct from others. <a ref='Joshua 24:9–10'>24:9–10</a> <b>Balaam.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Joshua 13:22'>Jos 13:22</a></i> about the unsavory nature of Balaam in <a ref='Nu 21-25'>Nu 21–25</a> . <a ref='Joshua 24:12'>24:12</a> <b>I sent the hornet before you.</b> This description, as also in <a ref='Exodus 23:28'>Ex 23:28</a> , is a picturesque figure (cf. also <a ref='Joshua 23:13'>23:13</a> ) portraying God’s own fighting to assist Israel ( <a ref='Joshua 23:3'>23:3</a> , <a ref='Joshua 23:5'>5</a> , <a ref='Joshua 23:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Joshua 23:13'>13</a> ).

The stone of witness by the holy place (sanctuary) here was at Shechem ( <a ref='Joshua 24:1'>24:1</a> ). This holy place is not a formal tent or building, but a sacred place by a tree (cf. <a ref='Genesis 12:6'>Ge 12:6</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 35:4'>35:4</a> ), as other places had significance in the past for worship to God ( <a ref='Genesis 21:33'>Ge 21:33</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 24:29–33'>24:29–33</a> <b>Joshua … Eleazar.</b> Three prominent leaders were buried as the conquering generation was passing on: Joseph, Joshua, and the High Priest Eleazar. <a ref='Joshua 24:29'>24:29</a> <b>110 years old.</b> This was ca. 1383 BC (cf. <a ref='Joshua 14:7–10'>14:7–10</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 24:31'>24:31</a> Faithfulness to God extended only one generation (cf. <a ref='Judges 2:6–13'>Jdg 2:6–13</a> ). <a ref='Joshua 24:32'>24:32</a> <b>the bones of Joseph.</b> These had been carried by the Israelites in the Exodus ( <a ref='Exodus 13:19'>Ex 13:19</a> ) as Joseph had made them promise ( <a ref='Genesis 50:25'>Ge 50:25</a> ).
