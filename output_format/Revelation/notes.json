The Gospels unveil Christ at His first coming in humiliation; Revelation reveals Him in His exaltation: 1) in blazing glory (vv. 7–20 ); 2) over His church, as its Lord (chaps. 2–3 ); 3) in His second coming, as He takes back the earth from the usurper, Satan, and establishes His kingdom (chaps. 4–20 ); and 4) as He lights up the eternal state (chaps. 21–22 ). The NT writers eagerly anticipate this unveiling ( 1Co 1:7 ; 2Th 1:7 ; 1Pe 1:7 ). God gave Him. As a reward for Christ’s perfect submission and atonement, the Father now presented to Him the great record of His future glory (cf. Php 2:5–11 ).

His unusual devotion to his brother earned the city its name, “brotherly love.” The city was an important commercial stop on a major trade route called the Imperial Post Road, a first-century mail route.

The sea represents the abyss or pit, the haunt of demons (cf. 11:7 ; 17:8 ; 20:1 ; Lk 8:31 ). The picture is of Satan summoning a powerful demon from the abyss, who then activates and controls the beast (Antichrist) and his empire. ten horns and seven heads. This description is like that of Satan in 12:3 . The heads may represent successive world empires—Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and the final kingdom of Antichrist ( see notes on 17:9–10 ). The final one is made up of all the kingdoms represented by the horns ( see notes for 17:12 ). Ten is a number that symbolizes the totality of human military and political power assisting the beast (Antichrist) as he controls the world. Horns always represent power, as in the animal kingdom—both offensive power (attack) and defensive power (protection). Daniel shows that the human Antichrist will rise up from these 10 kings ( Da 7:16–24 ). John picks up the numerical imagery of Da 2:41–42 , which refers to the 10 toes on the statue’s clay and iron feet. The apostle sees the beast as the final world government—the anti-Christ, anti-God coalition—headed by a revived Roman Empire, having the strengths of various world powers, yet mixed with weakness and ultimately crushed (cf. Da 2:32–45 ; 7:7–8 , 19–25 ; see note on 12:3 ). The crowns show the regal dominion of this confederate kingdom. blasphemous names.

This is the first of 6 references to the length of the millennial kingdom (cf. vv. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ). There are 3 main views of the duration and nature of this period: 1) Premillennialism sees this as a literal 1,000-year period during which Jesus Christ, in fulfillment of numerous prophecies (e.g., 2Sa 7:12–16 ; Ps 2 ; Is 11:6–12 ; 24:23 ; Hos 3:4–5 ; Joel 3:9–21 ; Am 9:8–15 ; Mic 4:1–8 ; Zep 3:14–20 ; Zec 14:1–11 ; Mt 24:29–31 , 36–44 ), reigns on the earth. Using the same general principles of interpretation for both prophetic and nonprophetic passages leads most naturally to premillennialism. Another strong argument supporting this view is that so many biblical prophecies have already been literally fulfilled, suggesting that future prophecies will likewise be fulfilled literally. 2) Postmillennialism understands the reference to a 1,000-year period as only symbolic of a golden age of righteousness and spiritual prosperity. It will be ushered in by the spread of the gospel during the present church age and brought to completion when Christ returns. According to this view, references to Christ’s reign on earth primarily describe His spiritual reign in the hearts of believers in the church. 3) Amillennialism understands the 1,000 years to be merely symbolic of a long period of time. This view interprets OT prophecies of a Millennium as being fulfilled spiritually now in the church (either on earth or in heaven) or as references to the eternal state. Using the same literal, historical, grammatical principles of interpretation so as to determine the normal sense of language, one is left with the inescapable conclusion that Christ will return and reign in a real kingdom on earth for 1,000 years. There is nothing in the text to render the conclusion that “a thousand years” is symbolic. Never in Scripture when “year” is used with a number is its meaning not literal ( see note on 2Pe 3:8 )."
