    "content": "The Book of Daniel Title According to Hebrew custom, the title is drawn from the prophet who throughout the book received revelations from God. Daniel bridges the entire 70 years of the Babylonian captivity (ca. 605–536 BC; cf. <a ref='Daniel 1:1'>1:1</a> and <a ref='Daniel 9:1–3'>9:1–3</a> ). Nine of the 12 chapters relate revelation through dreams/visions. Daniel was God’s mouthpiece to the Gentile and Jewish world, declaring God’s current and future plans. What Revelation is to the NT prophetically and apocalyptically, Daniel is to the OT. Author and Date Several verses indicate that the writer is Daniel ( <a ref='Daniel 8:15'>8:15</a> , <a ref='Daniel 8:27'>27</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:2'>9:2</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 10:2'>10:2</a> , <a ref='Daniel 10:7'>7</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 12:4–5'>12:4–5</a> ), whose name means “God is my Judge.” He wrote in the autobiographical first person from <a ref='Daniel 7:2'>7:2</a> on, and is to be distinguished from the other <a ref='Daniel 7:3'>3</a> Daniels of the OT (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 3:1'>1Chr 3:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 8:2'>Ezr 8:2</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 10:6'>Ne 10:6</a> ). As a teenager, possibly about 15 years old, Daniel was kidnapped from his noble family in Judah and deported to Babylon to be brainwashed into Babylonian culture for the task of assisting in dealing with the imported Jews. There he spent the remainder of a long life (85 years or more). He made the most of the Exile, successfully exalting God by his character and service. He quickly rose to the role of statesman by official royal appointment and served as a confidante of kings as well as a prophet in two world empires, i.e., the Babylonian ( <a ref='Daniel 2:48'>2:48</a> ) and the Medo-Persian ( <a ref='Daniel 6:1–2'>6:1–2</a> ). Christ confirmed Daniel as the author of this book (cf. <a ref='Matthew 24:15'>Mt 24:15</a> ). Daniel lived beyond the time described in <a ref='Daniel 10:1'>Da 10:1</a> (ca. 536 BC). It seems most probable that he wrote the book shortly after this date but before ca. 530 BC. <a ref='Daniel 2:4–7:28'>Daniel 2:4b–7:28</a> , which prophetically describes the course of Gentile world history, was originally and appropriately written in Aramaic, the contemporary language of international business. Ezekiel, Habakkuk, Jeremiah, and Zephaniah were Daniel’s prophetic contemporaries. Background and Setting The book begins in 605 BC when Babylon conquered Jerusalem and exiled Daniel, his 3 friends, and others. It continues to the eventual demise of Babylonian supremacy in 539 BC, when Medo-Persian besiegers conquered Babylon ( <a ref='Daniel 5:30–31'>5:30–31</a> ), and goes even beyond that to 536 BC ( <a ref='Daniel 10:1'>10:1</a> ). After Daniel was transported to Babylon, the Babylonian victors conquered Jerusalem in two further stages (597 BC and 586 BC). In both takeovers, they deported more Jewish captives. Daniel passionately remembered his home, particularly the temple at Jerusalem, almost 70 years after having been taken away from it ( <a ref='Daniel 6:10'>6:10</a> ). Daniel’s background is alluded to in part by Jeremiah, who names 3 of the last 5 kings in Judah before captivity (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 1:1–3'>Jer 1:1–3</a> ): Josiah (ca. 641–609 BC), Jehoiakim (ca. 609–597 BC) and Zedekiah (597–586 BC). Jehoahaz (ca. 609 BC) and Jehoiachin (ca. 598–597 BC) are not mentioned (cf. Jeremiah Introduction: Background and Setting ). Daniel is also mentioned by Ezekiel (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 14:14'>14:14</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 14:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 28:3'>28:3</a> ) as being righteous and wise. He is alluded to by the writer of Hebrews as one of “… the prophets, who through faith … shut the mouths of lions” ( <a ref='Hebrews 11:32–33'>Heb 11:32–33</a> ). The long-continued sin of the Judeans without national repentance eventually led to God’s judgment for which Jeremiah, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah had given fair warning. Earlier, Isaiah and other faithful prophets of God had also trumpeted the danger. When Assyrian power had ebbed by 625 BC, the Neo-Babylonians conquered: 1) Assyria with its capital Nineveh in 612 BC; 2) Egypt in the following years; and 3) Judah in 605 BC when they overthrew Jerusalem in the first of 3 steps (also 597 BC, 586 BC). Daniel was one of the first groups of deportees, and Ezekiel followed in 597 BC. Israel of the northern kingdom had earlier fallen to Assyria in 722 BC. With Judah’s captivity, the judgment was complete. In Babylon, Daniel received God’s word concerning successive stages of Gentile world domination through the centuries until the greatest Conqueror, Messiah, would put down all Gentile lordship. He then will defeat all foes and raise His covenant people to blessing in His glorious millennial kingdom. Historical and Theological Themes Daniel was written to encourage the exiled Jews by revealing God’s program for them, both during and after the time of Gentile power in the world. Prominent above every other theme in the book is God’s sovereign control over the affairs of all rulers and nations, and their final replacement with the True King. The key verses are <a ref='Daniel 2:20–22'>2:20–22</a> , <a ref='Daniel 2:44'>44</a> (cf. <a ref='Daniel 2:28'>2:28</a> , <a ref='Daniel 2:37'>37</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 4:34–35'>4:34–35</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 6:25–27'>6:25–27</a> ). God had not suffered defeat in allowing Israel’s fall ( <a ref='Da 1'>Da 1</a> ), but was providentially working His sure purposes toward an eventual full display of His King, the exalted Christ. He sovereignly allowed Gentiles to dominate Israel, i.e., Babylon (605–539 BC), Medo-Persia (539–331 BC), Greece (331–146 BC), Rome (146 BC–AD 476), and all the way to the Second Advent of Christ. These stages in Gentile power are set forth in chaps. <a ref='Da 2'>2</a> and <a ref='Da 7'>7</a> . This same theme also embraces Israel’s experience both in defeat and finally in her kingdom blessing in chaps. <a ref='Da 8-12'>8–12</a> (cf. <a ref='Daniel 2:35'>2:35</a> , <a ref='Daniel 2:45'>45</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 7:27'>7:27</a> ). A key aspect within the overarching theme of God’s kingly control is Messiah’s coming to rule the world in glory over all men ( <a ref='Daniel 2:35'>2:35</a> , <a ref='Daniel 2:45'>45</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 7:13–14'>7:13–14</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:27'>27</a> ). He is like a stone in chap. <a ref='Da 2'>2</a> , and like a son of man in chap. <a ref='Da 7'>7</a> . In addition, He is the Anointed One (Messiah) in chap. <a ref='Daniel 9:26'>9:26</a> . Chapter <a ref='Da 9'>9</a> provides the chronological framework from Daniel’s time to Christ’s kingdom. A second theme woven into the fabric of Daniel is the display of God’s sovereign power through miracles. Daniel’s era is one of 6 in the Bible with a major focus on miracles by which God accomplished His purposes. Other periods include: 1) the Creation and Flood ( <a ref='Ge 1-11'>Ge 1–11</a> ); 2) the patriarchs and Moses ( <a ref='Ge 12-De 34:12'>Ge 12–Dt</a> ); 3) Elijah and Elisha ( <a ref='1Ki 17-2Ki 13'>1Ki 17-2Ki 13</a> ); 4) Jesus and the apostles (Gospels, Acts); and 5) the time of the Second Advent (Revelation). God, who has everlasting dominion and ability to work according to His will ( <a ref='Daniel 4:34–35'>4:34–35</a> ), is capable of miracles, all of which would be lesser displays of power than was exhibited when He acted as Creator in <a ref='Genesis 1:1'>Ge 1:1</a> . Daniel chronicles the God-enabled recounting and interpreting of dreams which God used to reveal His will (chaps. <a ref='Da 2'>2</a> , <a ref='Da 4'>4</a> , <a ref='Da 7'>7</a> ). Other miracles included: 1) His writing on the wall and Daniel’s interpreting it (chap. <a ref='Da 5'>5</a> ); 2) His protection of the 3 men in a blazing furnace (chap. <a ref='Da 3'>3</a> ); 3) His provision of safety for Daniel in a lions’ den (chap. <a ref='Da 6'>6</a> ); and 4) supernatural prophecies (chaps. <a ref='Da 2'>2</a> ; <a ref='Da 7'>7</a> ; <a ref='Da 8'>8</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:24–12:13'>9:24—12:13</a> ). Interpretive Challenges The main challenges center on interpreting passages about future tribulation and kingdom promises. Though the use of Imperial Aramaic and archeology have confirmed the early date of writing, some skeptical interpreters, unwilling to acknowledge supernatural prophecies that came to pass (there are over 100 in chap. <a ref='Da 11'>11</a> alone that were fulfilled), place these details in the intertestamental times. They see these prophecies, not as miraculously foretelling the future, but as simply the observations of a later writer, who is recording events of his own day. Thus, they date Daniel in the days of Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175–164 BC, chap. <a ref='Da 8'>8</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 11:21–45'>11:21–45</a> ). According to this scheme, the expectation of the Stone and Son of Man (chaps. <a ref='Da 2'>2</a> , <a ref='Da 7'>7</a> ) turned out to be a mistaken notion that did not actually come to pass, or the writer was being intentionally deceptive. Actually, a future 7-year judgment period (cf. <a ref='Daniel 7:21–22'>7:21–22</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 11:36–45'>11:36–45</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 12:1'>12:1</a> ) and a literal 1,000-year kingdom (cf. <a ref='Rev 20'>Rev 20</a> ) after Christ’s second coming when He will reign over Israelites and Gentiles ( <a ref='Daniel 7:27'>7:27</a> ) are taught. This will be an era before and distinct from the final, absolutely perfect, ultimate state, i.e., the new heaven and the new earth with its capital, the New Jerusalem ( <a ref='Rev 21-22'>Rev 21–22</a> ). The literal interpretation of prophecy, including Daniel, leads to the premillennial perspective. Many other aspects of interpretation challenge readers: e.g., interpreting numbers ( <a ref='Daniel 1:12'>1:12</a> , <a ref='Daniel 1:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 3:19'>3:19</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:24–27'>9:24–27</a> ); identifying the one like a Son of Man ( <a ref='Daniel 7:13–14'>7:13–14</a> ); determining whether to see Antiochus of the past or Antichrist of the far future in <a ref='Daniel 8:19–23'>8:19–23</a> ; explaining the “seventy weeks” in <a ref='Daniel 9:24–27'>9:24–27</a> ; and deciding whether Antiochus of <a ref='Daniel 11:21–35'>11:21–35</a> is still meant in <a ref='Daniel 11:36–45'>11:36–45</a> , or whether it is the future Antichrist.

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Daniel 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>third year.</b> 606–605 BC. It was the third year by Babylonian dating, which did not count a king’s initial (accession) year, but began with the following year. So the “third year” is in harmony with the same year labeled as “fourth” by the Judean system of dating (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 46:2'>Jer 46:2</a> ). <b>Jehoiakim.</b> Son of Josiah who ruled (ca. 609–597 BC) when Nebuchadnezzar first plundered Jerusalem. <b>Nebuchadnezzar.</b> Son of Nabopolassar who ruled Babylon (ca. 605–562 BC). <a ref='Daniel 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>Shinar.</b> A term for Babylon. <b>his god.</b> Bel or Marduk (same as Merodach). Babylonian religion recognized other gods too (cf. <a ref='Daniel 1:7'>1:7</a> and <i>see note there</i> ). To conquer another nation’s deities was thought to prove the superiority of the victor’s god. <a ref='Daniel 1:4'>1:4</a> Qualifications for Jews to be trained in affairs of state included being: 1) <i>physically</i> free from bodily defects or handicap and handsome, i.e., a pleasing appearance in the public eye; 2) <i>mentally</i> sharp; and 3) <i>socially</i> poised and polished for representing the leadership. The ages of the trainees was most likely 14–17. <a ref='Daniel 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>educated three years.</b> Cf. <a ref='Daniel 2:1'>2:1</a> and <i>see note there</i> . <a ref='Daniel 1:7'>1:7</a> <b>names.</b> A key factor in the “brainwashing” process of the Babylonian training was a name switch. This was to link the inductees to local gods rather than to support their former religious loyalty. Daniel means “God is my judge,” but became Belteshazzar, or “Bel protect the king.” Hananiah, “Yahweh Is gracious,” was changed to Shadrach, “command of Aku,” another Babylonian god. Mishael, meaning “Who Is like Yahweh?” was given the name Meshach, “Who Is what Aku is?” Finally, Azariah, “Yahweh has helped,” became Abed-nego, “servant of Nego,” also called Nebo, a god of vegetation (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 46:1'>Is 46:1</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>Daniel set in his heart.</b> The pagan food and drink were devoted to idols. To indulge was to be understood as honoring these deities. Daniel “set in his heart” not to engage in compromise by being untrue to God’s call of commitment (cf. <a ref='Exodus 34:14–15'>Ex 34:14–15</a> ). Also, foods that God’s law prohibited ( <a ref='Le 11'>Lv 11</a> ) were items that pagans consumed; to partake entailed direct compromise (cf. <a ref='Daniel 1:12'>Da 1:12</a> ). Moses took this stand ( <a ref='Hebrews 11:24–26'>Heb 11:24–26</a> ), as did the psalmist ( <a ref='Psalms 119:115'>Ps 119:115</a> ), and Jesus ( <a ref='Hebrews 7:26'>Heb 7:26</a> ). Cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:14–18'>2Co 6:14–18</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 2:20'>2Ti 2:20</a> . <a ref='Daniel 1:9'>1:9</a> God honored Daniel’s trust and allegiance by sovereignly working favorably for him among the heathen leaders. In this instance, it prevented persecution and led to respect, whereas later on God permitted opposition against Daniel which also elevated him ( <a ref='Da 3'>Da 3</a> , <a ref='Da 6'>6</a> ). One way or another, God honors those who honor Him ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:30'>1Sa 2:30</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 16:9'>2Chr 16:9</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>vegetables.</b> This Hebrew word appears in a plural form in the OT, only here and in v. <a ref='Daniel 1:16'>16</a> . It might refer to wheat or barley, or it could be fresh vegetables. <a ref='Daniel 1:15'>1:15</a> <b>fatter.</b> Indicates healthiness. <a ref='Daniel 1:20'>1:20</a> <b>ten times better.</b> This probably uses the number qualitatively to signify fullness or completeness, i.e., they displayed incredible skill in answering, beyond the performance of other men who spoke without God’s help. Compare this with “ten days” (vv. <a ref='Daniel 1:12–15'>12–15</a> ) which is quantitative, since it refers to an actual passage of time. <a ref='Daniel 1:21'>1:21</a> <b>first year.</b> Cyrus of Persia conquered Babylon in 539 BC. His third year, in <a ref='Daniel 10:1'>10:1</a> , is the latest historical year that Daniel mentions (cf. <a ref='Ezra 1:1–2:1'>Ezr 1:1—2:1</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>second year.</b> Promotion of the 4 Hebrews after 3 years ( <a ref='Daniel 1:5'>1:5</a> , <a ref='Daniel 1:18'>18</a> ) agrees with the year of promotion after the dream in the “second year.” <i>See note on <a ref='Daniel 1:1'>1:1</a> .</i> <b>dreams.</b> In the time of revelation, God spoke through the interpretation of dreams that He induced (cf. v. <a ref='Daniel 2:29'>29</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>Chaldeans.</b> This could refer to all people native to Chaldea ( <a ref='Daniel 1:4'>1:4</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 3:8'>3:8</a> ), or, as here, to a special class of soothsayers who taught Chaldean culture. <a ref='Daniel 2:4'>2:4</a> <b>Aramaic.</b> This language, to which Daniel suddenly switches in v. <a ref='Daniel 2:4'>4b</a> and retains through <a ref='Daniel 7:28'>7:28</a> , was written with an alphabet like Hebrew, yet had distinctive differences. Aramaic was the popular language of the Babylonian, Assyrian, and Persian areas, and was useful in governmental and trade relations. <a ref='Daniel 1:1–2:4'>Daniel 1:1—2:4a</a> and <a ref='Daniel 8:1–12:13'>8:1—12:13</a> were written in Hebrew, possibly because the focus was more directly on Hebrew matters. <a ref='Daniel 2:4–7:28'>Daniel 2:4b–7:28</a> switches to Aramaic because the subject matter is centered more on other nations and matters largely involving them. <a ref='Daniel 2:5'>2:5</a> <b>The word … is firm.</b> The king shrewdly withheld the dream, though he remembered it, to test his experts. He was anxious for a straight interpretation, with no deception. <a ref='Daniel 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>Let the king say.</b> The worldly men of human skill failed (cf. the magicians in Pharaoh’s court, <a ref='Exodus 8:16–19'>Ex 8:16–19</a> , with Joseph, <a ref='Genesis 41:1'>Ge 41:1ff.</a> ). Verses <a ref='Daniel 2:8–13'>8–13</a> show how impossible it is for humans to truly interpret dreams from God (cf. v. <a ref='Daniel 2:27'>27</a> ). But Daniel, who trusted God in prayer (v. <a ref='Daniel 2:18'>18</a> ), received His supernatural interpretation (vv. <a ref='Daniel 2:19'>19</a> , <a ref='Daniel 2:30'>30</a> ). He gave credit to God in his prayer (vv. <a ref='Daniel 2:20–23'>20–23</a> ) and his testimony before Nebuchadnezzar (vv. <a ref='Daniel 2:23'>23</a> , <a ref='Daniel 2:45'>45</a> ). Later the king, too, gave God the glory (v. <a ref='Daniel 2:47'>47</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 2:20–23'>2:20–23</a> This praise to God sums up the theme of the whole book, namely that God is the One who controls all things and grants all wisdom and might. <a ref='Daniel 2:28'>2:28</a> <b>God … reveals mysteries.</b> Just as He did during Joseph’s time in Egypt (cf. <a ref='Genesis 40:8'>Ge 40:8</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 41:16'>41:16</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 2:36–45'>2:36–45</a> <b>we will say its interpretation.</b> Five empires in succession would rule over Israel, here pictured by parts of a statue (body). In <a ref='Da 7'>Da 7</a> , the same empires are represented by 4 great beasts. These empires are Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and the later revived Rome (cf. Introduction: Background and Setting ), each one differentiated from the previous as indicated by the declining quality of the metal. A stone picturing Christ ( <a ref='Luke 20:18'>Lk 20:18</a> ) at His second coming (as the Son of Man also does in <a ref='Daniel 7:13–14'>Da 7:13–14</a> ) will destroy the fourth empire in its final phase with catastrophic suddenness ( <a ref='Daniel 2:34–35'>2:34–35</a> , <a ref='Daniel 2:44–45'>44–45</a> ). Christ’s total shattering of Gentile power will result in the establishment of His millennial kingdom, the ultimate empire, and then continuing on eternally ( <a ref='Daniel 2:44'>2:44</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 7:27'>7:27</a> ).

Medo-Persia, though lacking the glory of Babylon (silver as compared to gold), was not inferior in strength to Babylon when its day of power came; it actually conquered Babylon ( <a ref='Daniel 7:5'>7:5</a> ).

It did have armies in iron armor known as the Iron Legions of Rome, and it had strength and invincibility. <a ref='Daniel 2:41'>2:41</a> <b>toes.</b> Ten toes represent the same kings as the 10 horns in <a ref='Daniel 7:24'>7:24</a> . They will rule in the final time of the Gentile empire, which Christ destroys in violent abruptness at His second coming. <a ref='Daniel 2:41–43'>2:41–43</a> <b>clay and … iron.</b> The iron in the 10 toes (kings) represents the Roman Empire in its revived form, prior to the second coming of Christ, as having iron-like strength for conquest (cf. <a ref='Revelation 13:4–5'>Rev 13:4–5</a> ). But the clay mixed in depicts that the union (federation) of kings and nations would have fatal flaws of human weakness, so that it is inherently vulnerable. <a ref='Daniel 2:44'>2:44</a> <b>stand forever.</b> God’s kingdom ruled by Messiah is the final rule, never to be replaced. It has a millennial phase and an eternal future, but it is the same king who rules both. <a ref='Daniel 2:45'>2:45</a> <b>stone … mountain.</b> The stone is Messiah (cf. <a ref='Psalms 118:22–23'>Ps 118:22–23</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 28:16'>Is 28:16</a> ; <a ref='Romans 9:33'>Ro 9:33</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:6'>1Pe 2:6</a> ; esp. <a ref='Luke 20:18'>Lk 20:18</a> ). The mountain pictures God’s all-transcending government that looms over weak earthly powers ( <a ref='Daniel 4:17'>4:17</a> , <a ref='Daniel 4:25'>25</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 47:8'>Pss 47:8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 103:19'>103:19</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 145:13'>145:13</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 17:9'>Rev 17:9</a> ). Messiah is “cut out” of this sovereign realm by God, which accords with the Son of Man coming ( <a ref='Daniel 7:13–14'>7:13–14</a> ); “without hands” denotes that the Messiah comes from God and is not of human origin or power (cf. the same idea in <a ref='Daniel 8:25'>8:25</a> ). The virgin birth and the resurrection, as well as the second coming, could be encompassed in this reference to supernatural origin. <a ref='Daniel 3:1'>3:1</a> <b>image of gold.</b> The statue, which the king arrogantly made, represented himself as an expression of his greatness and glory and reflected the dream where he was the head of gold ( <a ref='Daniel 2:38'>2:38</a> ). It was not necessarily made of solid gold, but more likely would have been overlaid with gold, like many objects found in the ruins of Babylon. The word for “image” usually means a human form. The height of the figure was about 90 ft. and the width 9 ft.; it would have been comparable in height to date palms found in that area. The self-deifying statue of the king need not have been grotesquely thin in proportion to the height since a massive base could have contributed to the height. This established the worship of Nebuchadnezzar and the nation under his power, in addition to the other gods. <a ref='Daniel 3:2'>3:2</a> Leaders attending the “summit conference” for Nebuchadnezzar’s display are: satraps, or leaders over regions; prefects, or military chiefs; governors, or civil administrators; counselors, or lawyers; treasurers; judges, or government arbiters; magistrates, or judges in our sense today; rulers, or other civil leaders. <a ref='Daniel 3:5'>3:5</a> <b>trigon.</b> A smaller, portable version of the harp, most likely played with a plectrum (pick), yielding high tones. <b>psaltery.</b> Possibly an instrument plucked with the fingers rather than a plectrum (pick), yielding low tones. <a ref='Daniel 3:6'>3:6</a> <b>furnace.</b> Some ancient kilns were found to have been shaped like a vertical tunnel open only at the top, with a dome supported by columns. Charcoal normally served as fuel. <a ref='Daniel 3:8'>3:8</a> <b>certain Chaldeans.</b> These are most likely the priests of Bel-merodach who were envious of these young Jews, and sought their death. <a ref='Daniel 3:12'>3:12</a> <b>they do not serve your gods and do not worship the golden image.</b> Enemies of God’s servants witnessed such a clear-cut testimony that they were in no doubt about their rejection of idolatry and unshakeable allegiance to the God of Israel. <a ref='Daniel 3:13'>3:13</a> <b>these men.</b> Daniel is not mentioned as being part of the refusal to worship witnessed by the Chaldeans. If present, he surely would have joined these others in faithfulness to God. <a ref='Daniel 3:15'>3:15</a> <b>what god…?</b> The king’s challenge would return to embarrass him. The true God was able to deliver, just as He was able to reveal a dream and its meaning. Nebuchadnezzar had earlier called him “a God of gods” ( <a ref='Daniel 2:47'>2:47</a> ), but having let that fade from his attention, he soon would be shocked and humiliated when God took up his challenge ( <a ref='Daniel 3:28–29'>3:28–29</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 3:16'>3:16</a> <b>we do not need to … answer.</b> The 3 men meant no disrespect. They did not have any defense, nor did they need to reconsider their commitment, since they stood fast for their God as the only true and living God. Their lives were in His hands as they indicated in vv. <a ref='Daniel 3:17–18'>17–18</a> (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 43:1–2'>Is 43:1–2</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 3:19'>3:19</a> <b>seven times more.</b> The king’s fury at being defied to his face led him to cry for an intensification of the heat. He was not literally requiring the fire to be 7 times hotter as a gauge would indicate, or requiring 7 times as long to heat, or 7 times the amount of fuel (cf. v. <a ref='Daniel 3:6'>6</a> , “immediately be cast”). The king in anger means “intensely hot,” using “seven” figuratively to denote completeness (as <a ref='Leviticus 26:18–28'>Lv 26:18–28</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 6:31'>Pr 6:31</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 24:16'>24:16</a> ), similar to “ten” in <a ref='Daniel 1:20'>Da 1:20</a> . Cf. “heated to an extraordinary degree” ( <a ref='Daniel 3:22'>3:22</a> ). A stone or brick furnace with an air draft could be made hotter by more fuel and air. <a ref='Daniel 3:22'>3:22</a> <b>carried up.</b> Refers to being taken upward on some kind of ramp to a spot near enough to the top to be thrown in (cf. v. <a ref='Daniel 3:26'>26</a> ). The fire was so hot it incinerated the king’s men. <a ref='Daniel 3:23'>3:23</a> <b>fell into the midst.</b> A shaft directed them into the furnace bottom, on top of the fuel. <a ref='Daniel 3:25'>3:25</a> <b>four men loosed.</b> The king seemed only to have known that the fourth person was a heavenly being. He called him a “son of <i>the</i> gods” (a pagan reference to one who appeared supernatural) and an “angel” (v. <a ref='Daniel 3:28'>28</a> ). The fourth person could possibly have been the second person of the Godhead (Jesus Christ) in a pre-incarnate appearance ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Joshua 5:13–15'>Jos 5:13–15</a> ; <a ref='Judges 6:11'>Jdg 6:11</a></i> ). <a ref='Daniel 3:27'>3:27</a> <b>the fire had no power.</b> When God enacts a miracle, He supernaturally controls all details so that His power is unmistakable, and there is no other explanation. <a ref='Daniel 3:28–30'>3:28–30</a> The king was convinced and eager to add the God of these men to his panoply of deities. Soon he learned that God was not one of many, but the only God ( <a ref='Da 4'>Da 4</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 4:1–3'>4:1–3</a> Nebuchadnezzar’s praise of God in <a ref='Daniel 4:1–3'>4:1–3</a> and <a ref='Daniel 4:34–37'>34b–37</a> is the theme that brackets the experience the king reiterates in the first person (vv. <a ref='Daniel 4:4–34'>4–34</a> ). He began and ended the narrative with praise, and in between told why he converted to such worship of the true God (cf. <a ref='Romans 11:33'>Ro 11:33</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 4:6'>4:6</a> <b>wise men of Babylon.</b> The king gave them another try (cf. <a ref='Daniel 2:2–13'>2:2–13</a> ), and they were again unable. <a ref='Daniel 4:8'>4:8</a> <b>at last Daniel came.</b> Daniel alone interpreted the tree vision (v. <a ref='Daniel 4:10'>10</a> ), enabled by God. <b>my god.</b> As the story began, he depicted himself still as a worshiper of Bel-merodach. <a ref='Daniel 4:9'>4:9</a> <b>chief of the magicians.</b> Here was the title the pagans gave him (cf. <a ref='Daniel 5:11'>5:11</a> ). <b>spirit.</b> The meaning here and in v. <a ref='Daniel 4:18'>18</a> (as well as <a ref='Daniel 5:11'>5:11</a> , <a ref='Daniel 5:14'>14</a> ) is rightly translated by some versions as “the Spirit of the Holy God.” Wording for the true God in the Hebrew of <a ref='Joshua 24:19'>Jos 24:19</a> is equivalent to the Aramaic here ( <i>see note on <a ref='Daniel 2:4'>2:4</a></i> ). Some translators believe he meant “a spirit of the holy gods.” This is unlikely, since no pagan worshipers claimed purity or holiness for their deities. In fact, just the opposite was believed. And since Nebuchadnezzar was rehearsing his conversion, he could genuinely identify the true Spirit of God. <a ref='Daniel 4:10–17'>4:10–17</a> <b>a tree.</b> This pictures Nebuchadnezzar after 605 BC (cf. <a ref='Daniel 4:20–22'>4:20–22</a> ). The creatures in v. <a ref='Daniel 4:12'>12</a> represent people under his rule (v. <a ref='Daniel 4:22'>22</a> ). The fall of the tree represents the coming time of God’s judgment on him (cf. <a ref='Daniel 4:23–25'>4:23–25</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 4:13'>4:13</a> <b>watcher, a holy one.</b> This was an angel (cf. v. <a ref='Daniel 4:23'>23</a> ), a servant of God, who controlled a nation’s rise or fall (cf. <a ref='Daniel 10:13'>Da 10:13</a> ). Angels often have roles administering God’s judgment, as shown also in <a ref='Ge 18'>Ge 18</a> , <a ref='Is 37'>Is 37</a> , and <a ref='Rev 16'>Rev 16</a> . <a ref='Daniel 4:15'>4:15</a> <b>stump.</b> The basis (nucleus) of the kingdom, still in existence in v. <a ref='Daniel 4:26'>26</a> (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 6:13'>Is 6:13</a> ), will later sprout as in nature ( <a ref='Job 14:7–9'>Job 14:7–9</a> ). The band is a guarantee that God will protect what remains intact and preserve the king’s rule (v. <a ref='Daniel 4:26'>26</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 4:16'>4:16</a> <b>the heart of a beast.</b> Some form of the disease called lycanthropy, in which a person thinks he is an animal and lives wildly, caused him to eat grass, have thick and unkept nails, shaggy hair, and behave inhumanly. <b>seven periods of time.</b> (cf. also <a ref='Daniel 4:23'>4:23</a> , <a ref='Daniel 4:25'>25</a> , <a ref='Daniel 4:32'>32</a> ). Probably “years” are meant, not “months,” which is used in v. <a ref='Daniel 4:29'>29</a> . Daniel uses the same term clearly to mean “years” in <a ref='Daniel 7:25'>7:25</a> . <a ref='Daniel 4:19'>4:19</a> <b>appalled.</b> Daniel’s compassionate alarm at the coming calamity. <a ref='Daniel 4:26'>4:26</a> <b>Heaven</b> that <b>rules.</b> God is synonymous with His abode. <a ref='Daniel 4:27'>4:27</a> <b>break away now from your sins.</b> Daniel called for a recognition of sin and repentance (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 55:7'>Is 55:7</a> ). He was not presenting a works salvation, but treating the issue of sin exactly as Jesus did with the rich young ruler in <a ref='Matthew 19:16–23'>Mt 19:16–23</a> . The king failed to repent at this point (v. <a ref='Daniel 4:30'>30</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 4:30'>4:30</a> <b>I myself have built.</b> Nebuchadnezzar was known for his building projects, such as a 400 foot high mountain terraced with flowing water and hanging gardens for his wife (one of the 7 wonders of the ancient world) as a place for cool refreshment. For such pride, judgment fell (vv. <a ref='Daniel 4:31–33'>31–33</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 4:34'>4:34</a> <b>lifted up my eyes.</b> God’s grace enables a person to do this ( <a ref='John 6:44'>Jn 6:44</a> , <a ref='John 6:65'>65</a> ). “For those who honor Me I will honor” ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:30'>1Sa 2:30</a> ); and “Though He [God] scoffs at the scoffers, yet He gives grace to the humble” ( <a ref='Proverbs 3:34'>Pr 3:34</a> ). The praise of vv. <a ref='Daniel 4:34–37'>34b–37</a> and <a ref='Daniel 4:1–3'>1–3</a> came as a result (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 9:23–24'>Jer 9:23–24</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 5:1'>5:1</a> <b>Belshazzar.</b> These events occurred in 539 BC, over two decades after Nebuchadnezzar’s death (ca. 563/2 BC). This king, whose name (similar to Daniel’s, cf. <a ref='Daniel 4:8'>4:8</a> ) means “Bel, protect the king,” is about to be conquered by the Medo-Persian army. <a ref='Daniel 5:2'>5:2</a> <b>vessels.</b> The celebration was designed to boost morale and break the feelings of doom, because at this very time, armies of Medo-Persia (cf. v. <a ref='Daniel 5:30'>30</a> ) had Babylon helplessly under siege. <a ref='Daniel 5:4'>5:4</a> This exercise was a call for their deities to deliver them. <a ref='Daniel 5:5'>5:5</a> <b>man’s hand.</b> Babylonian hands had taken God’s vessels (mentioned twice) and held them in contempt to dishonor and challenge Him. Now the hand that controls all men, and which none can restrain, challenged them ( <a ref='Daniel 4:35'>4:35</a> ). God’s answer to their challenge was clear, as in vv. <a ref='Daniel 5:23–28'>23–28</a> . <a ref='Daniel 5:7–9'>5:7–9</a> <b>they could not.</b> Without God’s help, the experts again failed (cf. chaps. <a ref='Da 2'>2</a> , <a ref='Da 4'>4</a> ), but God’s man Daniel would not. <a ref='Daniel 5:10'>5:10</a> <b>the queen answered.</b> Possibly she was a surviving wife or a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar. If the latter, she was a wife of Nabonidus who co-ruled with Belshazzar (cf. “third <i>ruler</i> ,” v. <a ref='Daniel 5:16'>16</a> ). She, like Nebuchadnezzar in chap. <a ref='Da 4'>4</a> , has confidence in Daniel (vv. <a ref='Daniel 5:11–12'>11–12</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 5:13'>5:13</a> <b>father.</b> Used in the same sense of grandfather (cf. v. <a ref='Daniel 5:18'>18</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 5:16'>5:16</a> <b>the third</b> ruler <b>.</b> This trio included Daniel, along with Belshazzar, Nebuchadnezzar’s grandson (ruled 553–539 BC), and Nabonidus (ruled 556–539 BC). The prizes turned out to be nonexistent in light of the city’s conquest that very night (vv. <a ref='Daniel 5:29–30'>29–30</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 5:25–29'>5:25–29</a> <b>MENĒ, MENĒ.</b> This means “counted,” or “appointed,” and is doubled for stronger emphasis. TEKĒL means “weighed” or “assessed,” by the God who weighs actions ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:3'>1Sa 2:3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 62:9'>Ps 62:9</a> ). PERĒS denotes “divided,” i.e., to the Medes and Persians. UPHARSIN in v. <a ref='Daniel 5:25'>25</a> is the plural of PERĒS, possibly emphasizing the parts in the division. The “U” prefix on PHARSIN has the idea of the English “and.” <a ref='Daniel 5:30'>5:30</a> <b>That same night.</b> One ancient account alleged that Persia’s General Ugbaru had troops dig a trench to divert and thus lower the waters of the Euphrates River. Since the river flowed through the city of Babylon, the lowered water enabled besiegers to unexpectedly invade via the waterway under the thick walls and reach the palace before the city was aware. The end then came quickly, as guards, Belshazzar, and others were slain on Oct. 16, 539 BC. <a ref='Daniel 5:31'>5:31</a> <b>Darius the Mede.</b> Possibly Darius is not a name, but an honored title for Cyrus, who with his army entered Babylon Oct. 29, 539 BC. It is used in inscriptions for at least 5 Persian rulers. History mentions no specific man named Darius the Mede. In <a ref='Daniel 6:28'>6:28</a> it is possible to translate, “Darius even … Cyrus.” A less likely possibility is that Darius is a second name for Gubaru, Cyrus’ appointed king to head up the Babylonian sector of his empire. Gubaru (or Gobryas) is distinct from Ugbaru, the general, who died soon after conquering Babylon. As previously prophesied, Babylon met God’s judgment (cf. <a ref='Is 13'>Is 13</a> ; <a ref='Is 47'>47</a> ; <a ref='Je 50'>Jer 50</a> ; <a ref='Je 51'>51</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 2:5–19'>Hab 2:5–19</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 6:1'>6:1</a> <b>satraps.</b> Each is a provincial administrator under the king. Daniel’s eminent appointment was to a post as “commissioner” (v. <a ref='Daniel 6:2'>2</a> ), assisting the king as his vice-regent. <a ref='Daniel 6:2'>6:2</a> <b>not suffer loss.</b> They were responsible to prevent loss from military revolts, tax evasion, or fraud. <a ref='Daniel 6:3'>6:3</a> <b>an extraordinary spirit.</b> Daniel, over 80, had enjoyed God’s blessing throughout his life (cf. <a ref='Daniel 1:20–21'>1:20–21</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 2:49'>2:49</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 4:8'>4:8</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 5:12'>5:12</a> ). <b>over the entire kingdom.</b> Daniel was the favorite of the king. He had experience, wisdom, a sense of history, leadership, a good reputation, ability, attitude, and revelation from the God of heaven. Apparently, God wanted him in the place of influence to encourage and assist in the Jews’ return to Judah, since the return was made in Cyrus’ first year (539–537 BC), right before the lions’ den incident. From the record of <a ref='Ezr 1'>Ezr 1</a> and <a ref='Ezr 6'>6</a> , all the basic elements of the return appear: 1) the temple was to be rebuilt with the cost paid from Cyrus’ treasury; 2) all Jews who visited could return, and those who stayed were urged to assist financially; and 3) the gold and silver vessels stolen from the temple by Nebuchadnezzar were to be taken back. To account for such favor toward the Jews, it is easy to think of Daniel not only influencing Cyrus to write such a decree, but even formulating it for him (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 21:1'>Pr 21:1</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 6:4'>6:4</a> <b>accusation against Daniel.</b> The jealous plot, not unlike the effort against Daniel’s 3 friends in <a ref='Daniel 3:8'>3:8ff.</a> , was also similar to that by Joseph’s brothers (cf. <a ref='Genesis 37:18–24'>Ge 37:18–24</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 6:7'>6:7</a> <b>besides you, O king.</b> A deceptive stroke of the king’s ego secured his injunction, which was designed to benefit Daniel’s peers. Ancient kings were frequently worshiped as gods. Pagans had such inferior views of their gods that such homage was no problem. <a ref='Daniel 6:8'>6:8</a> <b>law … which may not be revoked.</b> Once enacted, Medo-Persian law could not be changed, even by the king (cf. <a ref='Daniel 6:12'>6:12</a> , <a ref='Daniel 6:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Es 1:19'>Es 1:19</a> ; <a ref='Es 8:8'>8:8</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 6:10'>6:10</a> <b>toward Jerusalem.</b> Daniel’s uncompromising pattern of prayer toward God’s temple conformed to Solomon’s prayer that Yahweh’s people would do so ( <a ref='1 Kings 8:44–45'>1Ki 8:44–45</a> ). Three times a day was also the pattern established by David ( <a ref='Psalms 55:16–17'>Ps 55:16–17</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 6:13'>6:13</a> <b>one of the exiles from Judah.</b> Daniel had lived over 60 years in Babylon. His loyalty to the rulers was well known ( <a ref='Daniel 5:13'>5:13</a> ); in spite of that loyalty, his consistent faithfulness to God brought this threat. <a ref='Daniel 6:14'>6:14</a> He went from a self-styled god to a fool in one day. <a ref='Daniel 6:16'>6:16</a> <b>lions’ den.</b> The word “den” is related to the Hebrew term meaning “to dig,” so it refers to an underground pit which likely had 1) a hole at the top from which to drop food into the pit, and 2) a door at the foot of a ramp or on a hillside through which the lions could enter. <a ref='Daniel 6:22'>6:22</a> <b>His angel.</b> In this miracle, the angel was possibly the same person as the fourth person in the fiery furnace (cf. <a ref='Daniel 3:25'>3:25</a> and <i>see note there</i> ). <b>innocent before Him.</b> That is the supreme commendation of Daniel as blameless before God and unworthy of such a death. <a ref='Daniel 6:23'>6:23</a> <b>no harm … on him.</b> God openly honored Daniel’s faith for the purpose of showing His glory (cf. <a ref='Daniel 3:26–27'>3:26–27</a> ). That is not always the case, as God may choose to be glorified by permitting a trusted servant to be martyred (cf. Daniel in <a ref='Hebrews 11:33'>Heb 11:33</a> with others in <a ref='Daniel 11:35–38'>11:35–38</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 6:24'>6:24</a> <b>the king then said</b> the word <b>.</b> Like the sin of Achan ( <a ref='Joshua 7:20–26'>Jos 7:20–26</a> ), this sin against God, Darius, and Daniel cost the men and their families their lives. This judgment of God was also an important detail in the miracle, lest some critic suggest the lions were tame or toothless or not hungry. <a ref='Daniel 6:25–27'>6:25–27</a> <b>Darius the king wrote.</b> Impacted by Daniel and by Yahweh, he expressed himself as if he had come to a point of personal trust in God for his salvation such as Nebuchadnezzar (cf. <a ref='Daniel 4:1–3'>4:1–3</a> , <a ref='Daniel 4:34–37'>34–37</a> ).

Then it will be comprised of the 10 parts under kings (vv. <a ref='Daniel 7:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:24'>24</a> ), as well as an 11th king, the Antichrist (vv. <a ref='Daniel 7:8'>8</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:24'>24</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:3–10'>2Th 2:3–10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:1–10'>Rev 13:1–10</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 7:8'>7:8</a> <b>another horn.</b> This describes the rise of Antichrist (cf. v. <a ref='Daniel 7:20'>20</a> ).

As the second advent draws near, all 3 empires in their descendants will be a part of the Roman phase in its final form ( <a ref='Revelation 13:2'>Rev 13:2</a> ). Survival will <i>not</i> be possible for the final and revived phase of the fourth empire after Christ’s second coming, for catastrophic devastation (cf. <a ref='Daniel 2:35'>2:35</a> ) will utterly destroy it, and Christ’s kingdom will replace it. <a ref='Daniel 7:13–14'>7:13–14</a> <b>Son of Man.</b> The Messiah (cf. <a ref='Daniel 9:26'>9:26</a> ), Christ is meant; He often designated Himself by this phrase ( <a ref='Matthew 16:27'>Mt 16:27</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 19:28'>19:28</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 26:64'>26:64</a> ). “The clouds of heaven” are seen again in <a ref='Revelation 1:7'>Rev 1:7</a> .

Since Daniel saw himself in a vision, he may not have been bodily in that place (cf. Ezekiel’s vision of being at the Jerusalem temple, though bodily still with the elders in Babylon, <a ref='Eze 8-11'>Eze 8–11</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 8:3–9'>8:3–9</a> This imagery unfolded historically. The ram pictures the Medo-Persian Empire, as a whole, its two horns standing for the two entities (the Medes and the Persians) that merged into one. The history of this empire is briefly noted in v. <a ref='Daniel 8:4'>4</a> , as it is seen conquering from the east to the west, south and north, under Cyrus, as predicted also by Isaiah 150 years earlier ( <a ref='Isaiah 45:1–7'>Is 45:1–7</a> ). The longer horn, which appeared last, represents Persia. The goat (v. <a ref='Daniel 8:5'>5</a> ) represents Greece with its great horn Alexander, who with his army of 35,000, moved with such speed that he is pictured as not even touching the ground. The broken horn is Alexander in his death; the 4 horns are generals who became kings over 4 sectors of the Grecian empire after Alexander (cf. <a ref='Daniel 7:6'>7:6</a> ). The small horn is Antiochus Epiphanes, who rose from the third empire to rule the Syrian division in 175–164 BC and is the same king dominant in <a ref='Daniel 11:21–35'>11:21–35</a> . Cf. <a ref='Daniel 7:8'>7:8</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:24–26'>24–26</a> where a similar “little horn” clearly represents the final Antichrist. The reason both are described as “little horns” is because one prefigures the other. A far more detailed summary will come later in <a ref='Daniel 11:2–35'>11:2–35</a> . <a ref='Daniel 8:9'>8:9</a> <b>Beautiful</b> Land. Israel. Cf. <a ref='Daniel 11:16'>11:16</a> , <a ref='Daniel 11:41'>41</a> . <a ref='Daniel 8:10'>8:10</a> <b>host of heaven.</b> Picturesque language portrays Antiochus’ persecution against Jewish people using the figure of stars (cf. <a ref='Genesis 12:3'>Ge 12:3</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 15:5'>15:5</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 22:17'>22:17</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 12:41'>Ex 12:41</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:10'>Dt 1:10</a> ). When defeated, the “stars” (Jewish people) will fall under the tyrant’s domination. <a ref='Daniel 8:11'>8:11</a> <b>Commander.</b> In addition to the desecration of the temple (cf. 1Macc 1:20–24, 41–50), Antiochus blasphemed Christ to whom ultimately the host of Jewish people sacrifice and to whom the sanctuary belongs. He is later the “Prince of princes” (v. <a ref='Daniel 8:25'>25</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 8:13'>8:13</a> <b>holy one.</b> Angels are in view here. <a ref='Daniel 8:14'>8:14</a> <b>For 2,300 evenings</b> and <b>mornings.</b> These are 2,300 evenings/mornings, with no “and” in between, which refers to 2,300 total units or days. <a ref='Genesis 1:5'>Genesis 1:5</a> does use “and,” i.e., “Evening and … morning, one day.” The period runs to about 6 1/3 years of sacrificing a lamb twice a day, morning and evening ( <a ref='Exodus 29:38–39'>Ex 29:38–39</a> ). The prophecy was precise in identifying the time as that of Antiochus’ persecution, ca. Sept. 6, 171 BC to Dec. 25, 165/4 BC. After his death, Jews celebrated the cleansing of their holy place in the Feast of Lights, or Hanukkah, in celebration of the restoration led by Judas Maccabeus. <a ref='Daniel 8:15'>8:15</a> <b>had the appearance of a man.</b> The word for man meaning “a mighty man” is the linguistic framework for “Gabriel,” which means “mighty one of God.” This is the first mention of an angel by name in the Bible. <a ref='Daniel 8:16'>8:16</a> <b>voice of a man.</b> God spoke with a human voice. <b>Ulai.</b> A river east of the Persian city of Susa. <a ref='Daniel 8:17'>8:17</a> <b>terrified and fell.</b> Loss of consciousness is a common reaction to heavenly visitation (cf. <a ref='Eze 1'>Eze 1</a> ; <a ref='Is 6'>Is 6</a> ; <a ref='Rev 1'>Rev 1</a> ). <b>time of the end.</b> This term likely has a double sense of fulfillment. First, the “end” (as v. <a ref='Daniel 8:19'>19</a> ), “final” or “latter period” (vv. <a ref='Daniel 8:19'>19</a> , <a ref='Daniel 8:23'>23</a> ), and “appointed time” (v. <a ref='Daniel 8:19'>19</a> ) refer to time late in the specific span that the historical prophecy has in view. That time is the period defined by the empires in these verses, Persia (Ram) and Greece (Goat), when the Grecian sector will be divided into 4 parts (v. <a ref='Daniel 8:8'>8</a> ). One of these, the Syrian under Seleucus ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Daniel 8:22'>22</a></i> ), will eventually lead to Antiochus Epiphanes (175–164 BC) as the “small horn” meant in v. <a ref='Daniel 8:9'>9</a> , who persecutes the people of Israel (v. <a ref='Daniel 8:10'>10</a> ) and defies God (v. <a ref='Daniel 8:11'>11</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Daniel 11:21–35'>11:21–35</a> and <i>see notes there</i> . Secondly, this “little horn” in v. <a ref='Daniel 11:9'>9</a> , the Antichrist in the last days at the time of the eschatological fulfillment, sees Antiochus as a pattern of the Antichrist, who in many ways will be like him, though far greater in power, and will exercise his career in the end of the age just before Christ’s return. <a ref='Daniel 8:21'>8:21</a> <b>shaggy goat … large horn.</b> This is the third Gentile world power, the kingdom of Greece, and specifically Alexander the Great, the notable and “first king” after conquering Medo-Persia. Cf. <a ref='Daniel 11:3'>11:3</a> . <a ref='Daniel 8:22'>8:22</a> <b>broken</b> horn <b>and the four</b> horns <b>.</b> Alexander died at age 33 in 323 BC, leaving no heir ready to reign. <a ref='So 4'>So 4</a> men, after 22 years of fighting, assumed rule over 4 Grecian sectors: 1) Cassander, Macedonia; 2) Lysimachus, Thrace, and Asia Minor; 3) Seleucus, Syria, and Babylonia; 4) Ptolemy, Egypt, and Arabia. These are the 4 referred to in “toward the four winds” (v. <a ref='Daniel 8:8'>8</a> ). The phrase “not with his power” indicates they did not have Alexander’s power or direct family lineage. <a ref='Daniel 8:23–25'>8:23–25</a> <b>A king will stand.</b> The near fulfillment views Antiochus as the historical persecutor as in vv. <a ref='Daniel 8:9–14'>9–14</a> . His career down to 164 BC was “in the latter period of their reign,” that of the male goat in the Syrian territory. Rome conquered Greece by 146 BC, only a few years later, and became the next dominant empire. Antiochus died, “broken without hands,” due to insanity and disease of the bowels. The far fulfillment sees Antiochus in vv. <a ref='Daniel 8:23–25'>23–25</a> as prophetically illustrating the final tribulation period and the Antichrist. In such a view, the king here is also the “little horn,” as in <a ref='Daniel 7:7'>7:7</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 8:9'>8:9</a> and the willful king in <a ref='Daniel 11:36–45'>11:36–45</a> . <a ref='Daniel 8:25'>8:25</a> <b>Prince of princes.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Daniel 8:11'>8:11</a> .</i> <a ref='Daniel 8:26'>8:26</a> <b>conceal the vision.</b> Since he told it here, this did not mean to shut it up to secrecy but to preserve it as truth even if not to be fulfilled for a long time. <a ref='Daniel 9:1'>9:1</a> <b>the first year.</b> Ca. 539 BC. <b>made king.</b> This may mean that Darius (a title, not a proper name, <i>see note on <a ref='Daniel 5:31'>5:31</a></i> ) refers to Cyrus, who was made king by God’s allowance (cf. <a ref='Psalms 75:6–7'>Ps 75:6–7</a> ). Since Cyrus was the first monarch of the Medo-Persian empire, this time note was also the first year after the death of Belshazzar, when Babylon fell. <a ref='Daniel 9:2'>9:2</a> <b>seventy years.</b> Daniel’s study of “the books” (OT scrolls) focused on the years prophesied for the captivity by Jeremiah in <a ref='Jeremiah 25:11–12'>Jer 25:11–12</a> and <a ref='Jeremiah 29:10'>29:10</a> . Since the end of that span was near, he prayed for God’s next move on behalf of Israel. Cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:21'>2Chr 36:21</a> , where it is indicated that the 70 years of exile were intended to restore the Sabbath rests that Israel had ignored for so many years (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 25:4–5'>Lv 25:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 26:34–43'>26:34–43</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 9:4–19'>9:4–19</a> <b>I prayed.</b> Various aspects of the passage give rich instruction regarding prayer. True prayer is: in response to the Word (v. <a ref='Daniel 9:2'>2</a> ), characterized by fervency and self-denial (v. <a ref='Daniel 9:3'>3</a> ), identified unselfishly with God’s people (v. <a ref='Daniel 9:5'>5</a> ), strengthened by confession (vv. <a ref='Daniel 9:5–15'>5–15</a> ), dependent on God’s character (vv. <a ref='Daniel 9:4'>4</a> , <a ref='Daniel 9:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Daniel 9:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Daniel 9:15'>15</a> ), and has as its goal God’s glory (vv. <a ref='Daniel 9:16–19'>16–19</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 9:11'>9:11</a> <b>the curse.</b> This refers to the judgment that God brought, as promised, for Israel’s disobedience in the land ( <a ref='Leviticus 26:21–42'>Lv 26:21–42</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:15–68'>Dt 28:15–68</a> ). This is in contrast to the blessings associated with faith and obedience ( <a ref='Leviticus 26:3–20'>Lv 26:3–20</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:1–14'>Dt 28:1–14</a> ). God had given the promise that even in a time of judgment, if Israel would confess their sin, He would bring blessing again ( <a ref='Leviticus 26:40–42'>Lv 26:40–42</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 9:16'>9:16</a> Daniel prayed for restoration in 3 aspects. In effect he asked God to bring back “Your city” (vv. <a ref='Daniel 9:16'>16</a> , <a ref='Daniel 9:18'>18</a> ), “Your desolate sanctuary” (v. <a ref='Daniel 9:17'>17</a> ), and “Your people” (v. <a ref='Daniel 9:19'>19</a> ). God’s answer embraced all three (v. <a ref='Daniel 9:24'>24</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 9:21'>9:21</a> <b>the man Gabriel.</b> This angel, called a “man” because he appeared in the form of a man, appeared also in <a ref='Daniel 8:16'>8:16</a> . Cf. the angel Michael in <a ref='Daniel 10:13'>10:13</a> , <a ref='Daniel 10:21'>21</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 12:1'>12:1</a> . <b>the evening offering.</b> This was the second lamb of two offered daily (cf. <a ref='Daniel 8:14'>8:14</a> and <i>see note there</i> ), this one at 3 p.m., a common time for prayer ( <a ref='Ezra 9:5'>Ezr 9:5</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 9:24–26'>9:24–26</a> <b>Seventy weeks … from … until.</b> These are weeks of years, whereas weeks of days are described in a different way ( <a ref='Daniel 10:2–3'>10:2–3</a> ). The time spans from the Persian Artaxerxes’ decree to rebuild Jerusalem, ca. 445 BC ( <a ref='Nehemiah 2:1–8'>Ne 2:1–8</a> ), to the Messiah’s kingdom. This panorama includes: 1) 7 weeks or 49 years, possibly closing Nehemiah’s career in the rebuilding of Jerusalem as well as the end of the ministry of Malachi and the close of the OT; 2) 62 weeks or 434 more years for a total of 483 years to the first advent of Messiah. This was fulfilled at the triumphal entry on 10 Nisan, AD 30 ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 21:1–9'>Mt 21:1–9</a></i> ). The Messiah will be “cut off,” (a common reference to death); and 3) the final 7 years or 70th week of the time of Antichrist (cf. v. <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>27</a> ). Roman people, from whom the Antichrist will come, will “destroy the city” of Jerusalem and its temple in AD 70. <a ref='Daniel 9:24'>9:24</a> This highly complex and startlingly accurate prophecy answers Daniel’s prayer, not with reference to near history, but by giving the future of Israel in the final end of the age. God promises 2 sets of 3 accomplishments each. First, those related to sin are: 1) <b>finish the transgression,</b> i.e., restrain sin and Israel’s in particular in its long trend of apostasy, as in v. <a ref='Daniel 9:11'>11</a> ; 2) <b>make an end of sin,</b> i.e., to judge it with finality (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 9:26'>Heb 9:26</a> ); and 3) <b>make atonement for iniquity,</b> signifies to furnish the actual basis of covering sin by full atonement, the blood of the crucified Messiah who is “cut off” (v. <a ref='Daniel 9:26'>26</a> ), which affects the first two realities (cf. the fountain, <a ref='Zechariah 13:1'>Zec 13:1</a> ). Second, those accomplishments related to righteousness are: 1) <b>bring in … righteousness,</b> the eternal righteousness of Daniel’s people in their great change from centuries of apostasy; 2) <b>seal up vision,</b> i.e., no more revelation is needed, and God will bring these anticipations to completion by their fulfillment in Israel’s blessing as a nation; and 3) <b>anoint</b> the <b>Holy of Holies</b> , consecrate the Holy Place in a temple of the future that will be the center of worship in the millennial kingdom (cf. <a ref='Eze 40-48'>Eze 40–48</a> ). Clearly this must be understood to sweep to the end of Gentile power and the time of Antichrist right before Christ’s return. Summing up, the first 3 are fulfilled in principle at Christ’s first coming, in full at His return. The last 3 complete the plan at His Second Advent. <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>9:27</a> This is clearly the end of the age, the Second Advent judgment, because the bringing in of righteousness did not occur 7 years after the death of the Messiah, nor did the destruction of Jerusalem fit the 7-year period (occurring 37 years later). This is the future 7-year period which ends with sin’s final judgment and Christ’s reign of righteousness; i.e., the return of Christ and the establishment of His rule. These 7 years constitute the 70th week of Daniel. <b>he will make a firm covenant.</b> “He” is the last-mentioned prince (v. <a ref='Daniel 9:26'>26</a> ), leader of the Roman sphere (cf. chaps. <a ref='Da 2'>2</a> and <a ref='Da 7'>7</a> ), the Antichrist who comes in the latter days. The time is in the future tribulation period of “one week,” i.e., the final 7 years of v. <a ref='Daniel 9:24'>24</a> . He confirms (lit., causes to prevail) a 7-year covenant, his own pact with Israel for what will turn out actually to be for a shorter time. The leader in this covenant is the “little horn” of <a ref='Daniel 7:7–8'>7:7–8</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:20–21'>20–21</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:24–26'>24–26</a> , and the evil leader of NT prophecy ( <a ref='Mark 13:14'>Mk 13:14</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:3–10'>2Th 2:3–10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:1–10'>Rev 13:1–10</a> ). That he is in the future, even after Christ’s First Advent, is shown by 1) <a ref='Matthew 24:15'>Mt 24:15</a> ; 2) by the time references that match ( <a ref='Daniel 7:25'>7:25</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:2–3'>Rev 11:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:14'>12:14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:5'>13:5</a> ); and 3) by the end here extending to the Second Advent, matching the duration elsewhere mentioned in Daniel ( <a ref='Daniel 2:35'>2:35</a> , <a ref='Daniel 2:45'>45</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 7:15'>7:15ff.</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 12:1–3'>12:1–3</a> ) and <a ref='Revelation 11:2'>Rev 11:2</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:14'>12:14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:5'>13:5</a> . <b>middle of the week.</b> This is the halfway point of the 70th week of years, i.e., 7 years leading to Christ’s second coming. The Antichrist will break his covenant with Israel (v. <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>27a</a> ), which has resumed its ancient sacrificial system. Three and a half years of tribulation remain, agreeing with the time in other Scriptures ( <a ref='Daniel 7:25'>7:25</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:2–3'>Rev 11:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:14'>12:14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:5'>13:5</a> ; called “great tribulation,” cf. <a ref='Matthew 24:21'>Mt 24:21</a> ) as God’s wrath intensifies. <b>abominations … one who makes desolate.</b> The Antichrist will cause abomination against Jewish religion. This violation will desolate or ruin what Jews regard as sacred, namely their holy temple and the honoring of God’s presence there (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 9:3'>1Ki 9:3</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:4'>2Th 2:4</a> ). Jesus refers directly to this text in His Olivet discourse ( <a ref='Matthew 24:15'>Mt 24:15</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Daniel 11:31'>11:31</a> .</i> <b>complete destruction.</b> God permits this tribulation under the Antichrist’s persecutions and ultimately triumphs, achieving judgment of the sin and sinners in Israel ( <a ref='Daniel 12:7'>12:7</a> ) and in the world (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 25:31'>Jer 25:31</a> ). This includes the Antichrist ( <a ref='Daniel 11:45'>11:45</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:20'>Rev 19:20</a> ), and all who deserve judgment ( <a ref='Daniel 9:24'>9:24</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 13:41–43'>Mt 13:41–43</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 10:1'>10:1</a> <b>third year.</b> Ca. 536 BC. Two years had passed since the first decree to let Israel return (cf. <a ref='Ezra 1:1–2:1'>Ezr 1:1—2:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 2:64–3:1'>2:64—3:1</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 10:6'>10:6</a> <b>His body … like beryl.</b> The messenger whom Daniel sees in a vision (vv. <a ref='Daniel 10:1'>1</a> , <a ref='Daniel 10:7'>7</a> ) was distinct from the angel Michael, from whom he needed assistance (v. <a ref='Daniel 10:13'>13</a> ). The description of such glory has led some to see him as Christ in a pre-incarnate appearance (such as <a ref='Joshua 5:13–15'>Jos 5:13–15</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 6:2'>6:2</a> ; <a ref='Judges 6:11–23'>Jdg 6:11–23</a> ). He is described almost identically to Christ ( <a ref='Revelation 1:13–14'>Rev 1:13–14</a> ) and Daniel’s reaction is similar to John’s ( <a ref='Revelation 1:17'>Rev 1:17</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 10:10'>10:10</a> <b>a hand touched me.</b> Most likely this was Gabriel, who interpreted other revelations to Daniel (cf. <a ref='Daniel 8:16'>8:16</a> ) and spoke similarly of Daniel’s being beloved in <a ref='Daniel 9:20–23'>9:20–23</a> . <a ref='Daniel 10:12'>10:12</a> <b>your words were heard.</b> This was a great encouragement from God who was attentive to prayer and acted to answer it (cf. <a ref='Daniel 9:20–27'>9:20–27</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 10:13'>10:13</a> <b>prince of … Persia.</b> The 3 week delay was due to an evil angel opposing Gabriel in heavenly warfare (cf. <a ref='Revelation 16:12–14'>Rev 16:12–14</a> ). This angel was specially anointed with Persian power in an effort to thwart the work of God. This tells us that Satan engages in heavenly warfare to influence generations and nations against God and His people (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 6:10'>Eph 6:10ff.</a> ). <b>Michael.</b> This is the chief angel of heaven (cf. <a ref='Daniel 10:21'>10:21</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 12:1'>12:1</a> ; <a ref='Jude 1:9'>Jd 9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:7'>Rev 12:7</a> ). Michael remained to assure that the Jews would be free to return to their land. <a ref='Daniel 10:14'>10:14</a> <b>the days yet</b> future. This refers to the future plan of God for His people, extending from Daniel’s time to that of the Antichrist. <a ref='Daniel 10:19'>10:19</a> <b>I received strength.</b> This was the third time (vv. <a ref='Daniel 10:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Daniel 10:16'>16</a> ), showing the overwhelming trauma of divine presence and revelation. <a ref='Daniel 10:20'>10:20</a> <b>prince of Greece.</b> An evil angel contesting for the kingdom of Greece. <a ref='Daniel 10:21'>10:21</a> <b>writing of truth.</b> God’s plan of certain and true designs for men and nations, which He can reveal according to His discretion ( <a ref='Daniel 11:2'>11:2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 46:9–11'>Is 46:9–11</a> ). <b>except Michael.</b> The angel with Michael intended to handle the demons of Persia and Greece. This actually forms the heavenly basis for the earthly unfolding of history in <a ref='Daniel 11:2–35'>11:2–35</a> . <a ref='Daniel 11:1'>11:1</a> <b>first year.</b> Ca. 539 BC (cf. <a ref='Daniel 6:1'>6:1ff.</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:1'>9:1</a> ). <b>strengthen … fortress for him.</b> The messenger of <a ref='Daniel 10:10'>10:10ff.</a> continues to speak of assisting Michael (even as Michael had strengthened him in the battle with demons in <a ref='Daniel 10:21'>10:21</a> ), confirming Darius in his purpose of kindness to Israel in decreeing their return. <a ref='Daniel 11:2–45'>11:2–45</a> As in <a ref='Daniel 8:3–26'>8:3–26</a> , this prophecy sweeps all the way from the history of spiritual conflict in Israel ( <a ref='Daniel 11:2–35'>11:2–35</a> ) to the tribulation (vv. <a ref='Daniel 11:36–42'>36–42</a> ) when Michael aids in fully delivering Israel ( <a ref='Daniel 12:1'>12:1</a> ). The detail of this history is so minute and accurate, so confirmed by history, that unbelieving critics have, without evidence, insisted that it was actually written 400 years later than Daniel, after it had happened, which would make the prophet a deceiver. The prophecy actually looks ahead from Daniel to the final Antichrist. <a ref='Daniel 11:2–35'>11:2–35</a> This section unfolds the near fulfillment of the Persian kingdom and the reign of Greece through Antiochus Epiphanes. <a ref='Daniel 11:2'>11:2</a> <b>three more kings. … fourth.</b> The 3 in the Persian sphere, after Cyrus ( <a ref='Daniel 10:1'>10:1</a> ), were Cambyses (ca. 530–522 BC), Psuedo-Smerdis (ca. 522 BC), and Darius I Hystaspes (ca. 522–486 BC). The fourth is Xerxes I, called Ahasuerus in Esther (486–465 BC). Kings after Xerxes are not included, probably because Xerxes’ failed military campaign against the Greeks (481–479 BC) sounded the beginning of the end for Persia, which finally fell ca. 331 BC to Alexander the Great. <a ref='Daniel 11:3'>11:3</a> <b>a mighty king.</b> Alexander the Great (cf. <a ref='Daniel 8:5'>8:5</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 11:4'>11:4</a> After Alexander’s death (ca. 323 BC), 4 who were not of his posterity took sectors of his wide empire ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Daniel 7:6'>7:6</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 8:3–9'>8:3–9</a></i> ). The king of the South (Egypt) and king of the North (Aram, or Syria) receive emphasis in v. <a ref='Daniel 11:5'>5</a> and after. As time moved on, other leaders ruled, crossing and recrossing Israel. <a ref='Daniel 11:5–6'>11:5–6</a> <b>king of the South … king of the North.</b> King of the South represents the Ptolomies, the leaders of Egypt, contrasted often in vv. <a ref='Daniel 11:5'>5ff.</a> with the king of the North, the Seleucids, leaders of Syria (v. <a ref='Daniel 11:6'>6</a> ). South and north are in relation to Israel, for which the angel Gabriel, speaking in this passage, is so concerned. Verses <a ref='Daniel 11:5–20'>5–20</a> cover almost 200 years of wars between these bordering powers. <a ref='Daniel 11:6'>11:6</a> <b>form an alliance.</b> Berenice, daughter of Egypt’s Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–246 BC), married Syria’s King Antiochus II Theos (261–246 BC). The latter part of the verse refers to the political advantage they hoped the alliance would produce. Antiochus divorced his wife to marry Berenice. Later that divorced wife murdered Berenice, her baby son, and even Antiochus by poisoning him. Thus she brought her own son, Seleucus II Callinicus, to the throne. <a ref='Daniel 11:7'>11:7</a> <b>descendants of her line.</b> The murdered Berenice’s brother stood in his father’s place. His name was Ptolemy III Euergetes of Egypt (246–222 BC), and in reverse he conquered Syria, sacking their great treasure (v. <a ref='Daniel 11:8'>8</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 11:9'>11:9</a> <b>the latter will enter.</b> Syria’s Callinicus attacked Egypt ca. 240 BC but retreated, soundly beaten. <a ref='Daniel 11:10'>11:10</a> <b>his sons.</b> Seleucus’ sons (successors) kept up war against Egypt, as described in vv. <a ref='Daniel 11:11–35'>11–35</a> . <a ref='Daniel 11:11'>11:11</a> <b>king of the South.</b> Ptolemy IV Philopator (222–203 BC) devastated the Syrian army under Antiochus III the Great (223–187 BC). Egypt’s advantage would be brief (v. <a ref='Daniel 11:12'>12</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 11:13–16'>11:13–16</a> <b>king of the North.</b> Thirteen years later Antiochus returned with a great army, and in a series of strikes against Egypt brought Israel (“the Beautiful Land”) into his control as far south as Gaza. <a ref='Daniel 11:14'>11:14</a> <b>violent ones among your people.</b> Violent Jews wanted Judean independence from Egypt, but failed in their revolt. <a ref='Daniel 11:16'>11:16</a> <b>he who comes against him.</b> Antiochus III the Great took lasting dominion over Israel. <b>Beautiful Land.</b> Israel (cf. <a ref='Daniel 8:9'>8:9</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 11:17'>11:17</a> <b>give … the daughter.</b> Antiochus, feeling pressure from Rome (fourth empire, <a ref='Daniel 2:40'>2:40</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 7:7'>7:7</a> ) to make peace with Egypt, offered his daughter Cleopatra to marry Ptolemy V Epiphanes (ca. 192 BC). The Syrian thus hoped his daughter would spy to help him to “destroy” or weaken Egypt and bring it under his power. Cleopatra, instead of helping her father, favored her Egyptian mate. <a ref='Daniel 11:18'>11:18</a> <b>a ruler.</b> Antiochus had set his sights to conquer Greece, along the Mediterranean coastlands. But this brought him into conflict with Rome, so that a Roman, Lucius Scipio Asiaticus, repaid the Syrian aggression against Roman rights in the area with a resounding defeat (ca. 191–190 BC). <a ref='Daniel 11:19'>11:19</a> <b>fall.</b> Antiochus returned from defeat to his own land compelled by Rome to relinquish all his territory west of the Taurus and to repay the costs of war. He was likely killed by defenders of a Persian temple he tried to plunder at night in Elymais (to get money to pay reparations required by Rome). <a ref='Daniel 11:20'>11:20</a> <b>an oppressor.</b> Rome required Seleucus IV Philopator to render tribute, for Rome was increasingly powerful. The Syrian set out to tax his subjects heavily to raise the tribute. Soon, he died after being poisoned. The “Jewel of <i>his</i> kingdom” possibly refers to Israel (“the Beautiful Land”) with its splendid temple. <a ref='Daniel 11:21'>11:21</a> <b>a despised person.</b> In vv. <a ref='Daniel 11:21–35'>21–35</a> , the most cruel king of the North was Seleucid, the Syrian persecutor of Israel named Antiochus IV Epiphanes (cf. <a ref='Daniel 8:9–14'>8:9–14</a> , <a ref='Daniel 8:23–25'>23–25</a> ). He came to the throne when his brother Seleucus was murdered and a son of the dead king who might succeed him, Demetrius I Soter, was held hostage in Rome. In the vacuum, Antiochus seized power in Syria. <a ref='Daniel 11:22'>11:22</a> <b>will be flooded away.</b> Egypt’s armies were swept away by Antiochus’ invading forces as by a flood (cf. “flood” for military onslaught, <a ref='Daniel 9:26'>9:26</a> ). Israel’s “prince of the covenant,” Onias III, was murdered by his own defecting brother Menelaus at the request of Antiochus (171 BC). <a ref='Daniel 11:23'>11:23</a> <b>an alliance.</b> In an Egyptian struggle for the throne, Antiochus developed an alliance with Ptolemy VI Philometer over his rival Ptolemy VII Euergetes II (distinct from the leader in v. <a ref='Daniel 11:7'>7</a> ). By this alliance, Antiochus deceitfully plotted to gain greater power in Egypt. With a “small <i>force</i> ,” he conquered Memphis and the rest of Egypt all the way to Alexandria. <a ref='Daniel 11:24'>11:24</a> <b>In a time of ease he will enter.</b> Antiochus, under the guise of friendship, plundered the richest Egyptian places he could strike. To gain support, he gave lavish gifts, possibly battle spoils. <b>devise his schemes against strongholds.</b> He formed a scheme to take over Egypt. <a ref='Daniel 11:25'>11:25</a> <b>his strength … against the … South.</b> Antiochus attacked Philometer, who had become an enemy. The latter fell due to treachery by trusted supporters (v. <a ref='Daniel 11:26'>26a</a> ) and became Antiochus’ captive. <a ref='Daniel 11:26'>11:26</a> <b>those who eat.</b> Betraying counselors whom Philometer fed led him to attack Syria to secure his defeat and death for him and his men. <a ref='Daniel 11:27'>11:27</a> <b>will speak falsehood.</b> Antiochus feigned help to reinstate Ptolemy Philometer to Egypt’s throne, occupied then by Ptolemy Euergetes. Both kings lied at the conference, and Antiochus set Philometer up as king at Memphis, whereas Euergetes reigned at Alexandria. The two Egyptians soon agreed on a joint rule, frustrating the Syrian. <a ref='Daniel 11:28'>11:28</a> <b>against the holy covenant.</b> En route north through Israel to Syria with riches, Antiochus met a revolt, as sources outside Scripture mention. He struck Jerusalem’s temple, profaned the sacrificial system, massacred 80,000 men, took 40,000 prisoners, sold 40,000 as slaves, and squelched a Jewish bid to depose his own designated priest, Menelaus. <a ref='Daniel 11:29'>11:29</a> <b>come into the south.</b> Antiochus, for the third time, invaded Egypt against the joint rulership (ca. 168 BC); however, with much less success. <a ref='Daniel 11:30'>11:30</a> <b>ships … come against him.</b> A Roman fleet from Cyprus sided with Egypt, thwarting Antiochus’ attack. Backing down from engaging Rome in war, Antiochus left Egypt, taking out his rage on Israelites in his path. He opposed God’s Mosaic Covenant that some Jews kept, despite Syrian policies and some Jewish compromise. Antiochus showed favors to Jewish apostates (“who forsake the holy covenant”) as non-biblical writings attest. <a ref='Daniel 11:31'>11:31</a> <b>profane the sanctuary.</b> Antiochus’ soldiers, no doubt working with apostate Jews, guarded the temple, halting all worship, while others attacked the city on the Sabbath and slaughtered men, women, and children. Soldiers desecrated Israel’s temple, banned circumcision and daily sacrifices (1Macc 1:44–54), and sacrificed a pig on the altar. The Syrians on Chislev (Dec. 15, 167 BC) even imposed an idol statue in honor of the Olympian god Zeus into the temple. Jews called it “the abomination of desolation,” i.e., emptying or ruining for Jewish worship. <b>abomination of desolation.</b> Antiochus’ soldiers profaned God’s temple by spreading sow’s broth on the altar and banning daily sacrifices (cf. <a ref='Daniel 8:14'>8:14</a> and <i>see note there</i> ) as described in 1Macc 1:44–54. Both Daniel and Jesus said this atrocity was only a preview of the abomination that would happen later under the final Antichrist ( <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>9:27</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:15'>Mt 24:15</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 11:32–34'>11:32–34</a> <b>Those who act wickedly.</b> Compromisers (cf. v. <a ref='Daniel 11:30'>30</a> ) among the Jews were enticed by flattery to side with Antiochus and be corrupted (cf. 1Macc 1:11–15). <a ref='Daniel 11:32'>11:32</a> <b>the people who know their God.</b> Jews loyal to God (called Hasideans) stood on firm convictions, suffering death rather than compromising (v. <a ref='Daniel 11:33'>33</a> ; as also 1Macc 1:62–63). Judas Maccabeus, helped by Rome, led them in a successful revolt. <a ref='Daniel 11:33'>11:33</a> <b>give understanding to the many.</b> Those who believe and know the truth will instruct others in the Scriptures, while also suffering continued persecution. <a ref='Daniel 11:34'>11:34</a> <b>a little help.</b> Many would fall away, and Jews committed to the covenant would have little help, humanly speaking. Some, fearing the faithful remnant’s dealing with apostates, pretended loyalty. <a ref='Daniel 11:35'>11:35</a> <b>to refine.</b> Faced by persecution, some who remained true to God’s “insight” (any true believers, <a ref='Daniel 12:3'>12:3</a> ) were to fall as martyrs. The gracious design of such suffering was to sanctify them. The persecution pattern continues until the final “time of the end” that God appointed, at Christ’s second coming. Reference to this “time of the end” prepares for a transition in v. <a ref='Daniel 11:36'>36</a> to final tribulation times when the Antichrist, whom Antiochus prefigures, will be in power. <b>the time of the end … appointed time.</b> These two eschatological terms point to a forward leap across thousands of years of history from Antiochus to a future similar trial when the willful king (vv. <a ref='Daniel 11:36–45'>36–45</a> ) rules. The willful king is the “little horn,” the Antichrist ( <a ref='Daniel 7:7–8'>7:7–8</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:20–21'>20–21</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:24–26'>24–26</a> ), the persecutor of <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>9:27</a> ( <i>see note there</i> ). <a ref='Daniel 11:36–45'>11:36–45</a> This section is the far fulfillment of God’s prophetic plan. It summarizes details of Daniel’s 70th week which are found nowhere else in Scripture. Antiochus Epiphanes, a type of Antichrist, is the perfect transition point to the actual Antichrist. <a ref='Daniel 11:36'>11:36</a> <b>Then.</b> This word points to the future “time of the end” mentioned in v. <a ref='Daniel 11:35'>35</a> . Verses <a ref='Daniel 11:36–45'>36–45</a> discuss the career of the final Antichrist in the last 7 years before Christ’s millennial kingdom. This willful king is the final Antichrist ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Daniel 7:8'>7:8</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:11–12'>11–12</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:25'>25</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>9:27</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Revelation 13:4–7'>Rev 13:4–7</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 11:37'>11:37</a> <b>gods of his fathers.</b> Pagan Gentiles have had traditional gods passed down from their fathers, but this king has no regard for any of them. His only god is power (v. <a ref='Daniel 11:38'>38</a> , “god of fortresses”). <b>desire of women.</b> This could mean that Antichrist will be a homosexual; but it surely means he has no normal desire for or, interest in, women, e.g., as one who is celibate. <a ref='Daniel 11:38'>11:38</a> <b>god of fortresses.</b> The term for fortress is used 5 other times in this chapter (vv. <a ref='Daniel 11:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Daniel 11:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Daniel 11:19'>19</a> , <a ref='Daniel 11:31'>31</a> , <a ref='Daniel 11:39'>39</a> ) and each time means “a strong place.” Power is to be his god, and he spends all his treasures to become powerful and to finance wars. With this power, he will attack every stronghold (v. <a ref='Daniel 11:39'>39</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 11:40'>11:40</a> <b>king of … South … North.</b> Here is the final north/south conflict. The south was Egypt in the earlier context. Here is the last great battle with the final army from the north retaliating against the attack of the final southern African power. Antichrist will not allow this without striking back and winning, defeating both as recorded in v. <a ref='Daniel 11:41'>41ff.</a> The willful king, Antichrist, withstands onslaughts from both, and prevails, entering Israel (“the Beautiful Land”) and, perhaps, committing at that time the abomination of desolation ( <a ref='Daniel 9:23'>9:23</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:15'>Mt 24:15</a> ). With this victory, he will be established in power for a time. <a ref='Daniel 11:44'>11:44</a> <b>reports from … East and … North.</b> Military bulletins alert the willful king, in his victories, of other sectors of the world deploying troops to the Palestinian theater (cf. <a ref='Revelation 9:16'>Rev 9:16</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:12'>16:12</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 11:45'>11:45</a> <b>his end.</b> To face the latest threats, the willful king sets up his command post between the Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea (and/or Sea of Galilee) and the holy mountain of Jerusalem, his troops filling the land (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 12:2–3'>Zec 12:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:2–3'>14:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:17–21'>Rev 19:17–21</a> ). No one is able to help him against God, who, by the return of Christ, brings him to his end (cf. <a ref='Revelation 19:20'>Rev 19:20</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 12:1'>12:1</a> <b>that time.</b> This points back to <a ref='Daniel 11:36–45'>11:36–45</a> , the time of the ascendancy of Antichrist during the final tribulation period. During that period, Michael the archangel (cf. <a ref='Jude 1:9'>Jd 9</a> ) of <a ref='Daniel 10:13'>10:13</a> , <a ref='Daniel 10:21'>21</a> ministers with special attention to protecting Israel during that Gentile time (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 26:20–21'>Is 26:20–21</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 30:7'>Jer 30:7</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:21'>Mt 24:21</a> ). “Your people” means Daniel’s Israelite people, who can have hope, even in the distress of an unprecedented kind set for the Great Tribulation ( <a ref='Matthew 24:21'>Mt 24:21</a> ; cf. <a ref='Revelation 12:12–17'>Rev 12:12–17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:7'>13:7</a> ). “The book” is the book of the saved ( <a ref='Malachi 3:16–4:3'>Mal 3:16—4:3</a> ; <a ref='Luke 10:20'>Lk 10:20</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:8'>Rev 13:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 17:8'>17:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:12'>20:12</a> , <a ref='Revelation 20:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 21:27'>21:27</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 12:2'>12:2</a> <b>Many … these … others.</b> Two groups will arise from death constituting the “many,” meaning all, as in <a ref='John 5:29'>Jn 5:29</a> . Those of faith will rise to eternal life, the rest of the unsaved to eternal torment. The souls of OT saints are already with Yahweh; at that time, they will receive glorified bodies (cf. <a ref='Revelation 20:4–6'>Rev 20:4–6</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 12:3'>12:3</a> <b>have insight.</b> Those having true knowledge, by faith in God’s Word, not only leaders (as <a ref='Daniel 11:33'>11:33</a> ), but others ( <a ref='Daniel 11:35'>11:35</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 12:10'>12:10</a> ). To “shine” in glory is a privilege of all the saved (cf. the principle in <a ref='1 Thessalonians 2:12'>1Th 2:12</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 5:10'>1Pe 5:10</a> ). Any who influence others for righteousness shine like stars in varying capacities of light as their reward (as in <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:8'>1Co 3:8</a> ). The faithfulness of the believer’s witness will determine one’s eternal capacity to reflect God’s glory. <a ref='Daniel 12:4'>12:4</a> <b>the time of the end.</b> Refers to the 70th week of tribulation (cf. <a ref='Daniel 11:35'>11:35</a> , <a ref='Daniel 11:40'>40</a> ). <b>go to and fro.</b> This Hebrew verb form always refers to the movement of a person searching for something.

Adding these (one, two, and one-half) come to the final 3 1/2 years of Daniel’s 70th week ( <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>9:27</a> ), the time of trouble when the “little horn,” or willful king, persecutes the saints ( <a ref='Daniel 7:25'>7:25</a> ; cf. <a ref='Daniel 11:36–39'>11:36–39</a> and <a ref='Revelation 12:14'>Rev 12:14</a> ; the same span is described by other phrases in <a ref='Revelation 11:2–3'>Rev 11:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:5'>13:5</a> ). <a ref='Daniel 12:10'>12:10</a> <b>Many … purified.</b> Salvation will come to many Jews during the Great Tribulation (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 13:8–9'>Zec 13:8–9</a> , where the prophet speaks of one-third; <a ref='Romans 11:26'>Ro 11:26</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:13'>Rev 11:13</a> ).
