There is no Scripture to indicate that God’s glory ever did come to Zerubbabel’s temple, as the first temple was filled with the Shekinah glory (cf. 1Ki 8:10–11 ; 2Chr 5:13–14 ). However, His glory will fill the millennial temple ( Eze 43:5 ). This glorification cannot refer to Christ’s physical presence in Herod’s temple, for the events of vv. 6–9 cannot be accounted for historically. The context speaks of the establishment of His earthly, Davidic, millennial kingdom and His presence in the temple during that kingdom."

The pre-Exilic signet of Jehoiachin was removed by God ( Jer 22:24 ) and renewed here in his grandson, Zerubbabel, who reestablished the Davidic line of kings, which would culminate in the millennial reign of Christ.
