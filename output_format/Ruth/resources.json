    "content": "The Book of Ruth Title Ancient versions and modern translations consistently entitle this book after Ruth the Moabitess heroine, who is mentioned by name 12 times ( <a ref='Ruth 1:4'>1:4</a> to <a ref='Ruth 4:13'>4:13</a> ). Only two OT books receive their names from women—Ruth and Esther. The OT does not again refer to Ruth, while the NT mentions her just once—in the context of Christ’s genealogy ( <a ref='Matthew 1:5'>Mt 1:5</a> ; cf. <a ref='Ruth 4:18–22'>Ru 4:18–22</a> ). “Ruth” most likely comes from a Moabite and/or Hebrew word meaning “friendship.” Ruth arrived in Bethlehem as a foreigner ( <a ref='Ruth 2:10'>2:10</a> ), became a maidservant ( <a ref='Ruth 2:13'>2:13</a> ), married wealthy Boaz ( <a ref='Ruth 4:13'>4:13</a> ), and was included in the physical lineage of Christ ( <a ref='Matthew 1:5'>Mt 1:5</a> ). Author and Date Jewish tradition credits Samuel as the author, which is plausible since he did not die ( <a ref='1 Samuel 25:1'>1Sa 25:1</a> ) until after he had anointed David as God’s chosen king ( <a ref='1 Samuel 16:6–13'>1Sa 16:6–13</a> ). However, neither internal features nor external testimony conclusively identify the writer. This exquisite story most likely appeared shortly before or during David’s reign in Israel (1011–971 BC), since David is mentioned ( <a ref='Ruth 4:17'>4:17</a> , <a ref='Ruth 4:22'>22</a> ) but not Solomon. Goethe reportedly labeled this piece of anonymous but unexcelled literature as “the loveliest, complete work on a small scale.” What Venus is to statuary and the Mona Lisa is to paintings, Ruth is to literature. Background and Setting Aside from Bethlehem ( <a ref='Ruth 1:1'>1:1</a> ), Moab (the perennial enemy of Israel, which was east of the Dead Sea), stands as the only other mentioned geographic/national entity ( <a ref='Ruth 1:1–2'>1:1–2</a> ). This country originated when Lot fathered Moab by an incestuous union with his oldest daughter ( <a ref='Genesis 19:37'>Ge 19:37</a> ). Centuries later the Jews encountered opposition from Balak, king of Moab, through the prophet Balaam ( <a ref='Nu 22-25'>Nu 22–25</a> ). For 18 years Moab oppressed Israel during the time of the judges ( <a ref='Judges 3:12–30'>Jdg 3:12–30</a> ). Saul defeated the Moabites ( <a ref='1 Samuel 14:47'>1Sa 14:47</a> ) while David seemed to enjoy a peaceful relationship with them ( <a ref='1 Samuel 22:3–4'>1Sa 22:3–4</a> ). Later, Moab again troubled Israel ( <a ref='2 Kings 3:5–27'>2Ki 3:5–27</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 9:1'>Ezr 9:1</a> ). Because of Moab’s idolatrous worship of Chemosh ( <a ref='1 Kings 11:7'>1Ki 11:7</a> , <a ref='1 Kings 11:33'>33</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 23:13'>2Ki 23:13</a> ) and its opposition to Israel, God cursed Moab ( <a ref='Is 15-16'>Is 15–16</a> ; <a ref='Je 48'>Jer 48</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 25:8–11'>Eze 25:8–11</a> ; <a ref='Amos 2:1–3'>Am 2:1–3</a> ). The story of Ruth occurred in the days “when the judges judged” Israel ( <a ref='Ruth 1:1'>1:1</a> ), ca. 1370 to 1041 BC ( <a ref='Judges 2:16–19'>Jdg 2:16–19</a> ), and thus bridges time from the judges to Israel’s monarchy. God used “a famine in the land” of Judah ( <a ref='Ruth 1:1'>1:1</a> ) to set in motion this beautiful drama, although the famine does not receive mention in Judges, which causes difficulty in dating the events of Ruth. However, by working backward in time from the well known date of David’s reign (1011–971 BC), the time period of Ruth would most likely be during the judgeship of Jair, ca. 1126–1105 BC ( <a ref='Judges 10:3–5'>Jdg 10:3–5</a> ). Ruth covers about 11 or 12 years according to the following scenario: 1) <a ref='Ruth 1:1–18'>1:1–18</a> , ten years in Moab ( <a ref='Ruth 1:4'>1:4</a> ); 2) <a ref='Ruth 1:19–2:23'>1:19—2:23</a> , several months (mid-Apr. to mid-June) in Boaz’s field ( <a ref='Ruth 1:22'>1:22</a> ; <a ref='Ruth 2:23'>2:23</a> ); 3) <a ref='Ruth 3:1–18'>3:1–18</a> , one day in Bethlehem and one night at the threshing floor; and 4) <a ref='Ruth 4:1–22'>4:1–22</a> , about one year in Bethlehem. Historical and Theological Themes All 85 verses of Ruth have been accepted as canonical by the Jews. Along with Song of Songs, Esther, Ecclesiastes, and Lamentations, Ruth stands with the OT books of the Megilloth or “five scrolls.” Rabbis read these books in the synagogue on 5 special occasions during the year—Ruth being read at Pentecost due to the harvest scenes of <a ref='Ru 2-3'>Ru 2–3</a> . Genealogically, Ruth looks back almost 900 years to events in the time of Jacob ( <a ref='Ruth 4:11'>4:11</a> ) and forward about 100 years to the coming reign of David ( <a ref='Ruth 4:17'>4:17</a> , <a ref='Ruth 4:22'>22</a> ). While Joshua and Judges emphasize the legacy of the nation and their land of promise, Ruth focuses on the lineage of David back to the patriarchal era. At least 7 major theological themes emerge in Ruth. First, Ruth the Moabitess illustrates that God’s redemptive plan extended beyond the Jews to Gentiles ( <a ref='Ruth 2:12'>2:12</a> ). Second, Ruth demonstrates that women are coheirs with men of God’s salvation grace (cf. <a ref='Galatians 3:28'>Ga 3:28</a> ). Third, Ruth portrays the virtuous woman of <a ref='Proverbs 31:10'>Pr 31:10</a> (cf. <a ref='Ruth 3:11'>3:11</a> ). Fourth, Ruth describes God’s sovereign ( <a ref='Ruth 1:6'>1:6</a> ; <a ref='Ruth 4:13'>4:13</a> ) and providential care ( <a ref='Ruth 2:3'>2:3</a> ) of seemingly unimportant people at apparently insignificant times which later prove to be monumentally crucial to accomplishing God’s will. Fifth, Ruth along with Tamar ( <a ref='Ge 38'>Ge 38</a> ), Rahab ( <a ref='Jos 2'>Jos 2</a> ), and Bathsheba ( <a ref='2Sa 11-12'>2Sa 11–12</a> ) stand in the genealogy of the messianic line ( <a ref='Ruth 4:17'>4:17</a> , <a ref='Ruth 4:22'>22</a> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 1:5'>Mt 1:5</a> ). Sixth, Boaz, as a type of Christ, becomes Ruth’s kinsman-redeemer ( <a ref='Ruth 4:1–12'>4:1–12</a> ). Finally, David’s right (and thus Christ’s right) to the throne of Israel is traced back to Judah ( <a ref='Ruth 4:18–22'>4:18–22</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 49:8–12'>Ge 49:8–12</a> ). Interpretive Challenges Ruth should be understood as a true historical account. The reliable facts surrounding Ruth, in addition to its complete compatibility with Judges plus 1 and 2 Samuel, confirm Ruth’s authenticity. However, some individual difficulties require careful attention. First, how could Ruth worship at the tabernacle then in Shiloh ( <a ref='1 Samuel 4:4'>1Sa 4:4</a> ), since <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:3'>Deuteronomy 23:3</a> expressly forbids Moabites from entering the assembly for 10 generations? Since the Jews entered the land ca. 1405 BC and Ruth was not born until ca. 1150 BC, she then represented at least the 11th generation (probably later) if the time limitation ended at ten generations. If “ten generations” was an idiom meaning “forever” as <a ref='Nehemiah 13:1'>Ne 13:1</a> implies, then Ruth would be like the foreigner of <a ref='Isaiah 56:1–8'>Is 56:1–8</a> who joined himself to the Lord ( <a ref='Ruth 1:16'>1:16</a> ), thus gaining entrance to the assembly. Second, are there not immoral overtones to Boaz and Ruth spending the night together before marriage ( <a ref='Ruth 3:3–18'>3:3–18</a> )? Ruth engaged in a common ancient Near Eastern custom by asking Boaz to take her for his wife, symbolically pictured by throwing a garment over the intended woman ( <a ref='Ruth 3:9'>3:9</a> ), just as Jehovah spread His garment over Israel ( <a ref='Ezekiel 16:8'>Eze 16:8</a> ). The text does not even hint at the slightest moral impropriety, noting that Ruth slept at his feet ( <a ref='Ruth 3:14'>3:14</a> ). Thus, Boaz became God’s answer to his own earlier prayer for Ruth ( <a ref='Ruth 2:12'>2:12</a> ). Third, would not the levirate principle of <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:5–6'>Dt 25:5–6</a> lead to incest and/or polygamy if the nearest relative was already married? God would not design a good plan to involve the grossest of immoralities punishable by death. It is to be assumed that the implementation of <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:5–6'>Dt 25:5–6</a> could involve only the nearest relative who was eligible for marriage as qualified by other stipulations of the law. Fourth, was not marriage to a Moabitess strictly forbidden by the law? The nations or people to whom marriage was prohibited were those possessing the land that Israel would enter ( <a ref='Exodus 34:16'>Ex 34:16</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:1–3'>Dt 7:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 23:12'>Jos 23:12</a> ) which did not include Moab (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:1'>Dt 7:1</a> ). Further, Boaz married Ruth, a devout proselyte to Jehovah (1:16–17), not a pagan worshiper of Chemosh—Moab’s chief deity (cf. later problems in <a ref='Ezra 9:1–2'>Ezr 9:1–2</a> and <a ref='Nehemiah 13:23–25'>Ne 13:23–25</a> ).

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Ruth 1:1–5'>1:1–5</a> This introduction to Ruth sets in motion the following events, which culminate in Obed’s birth and his relationship to the Davidic line of Christ. See Introduction: Background and Setting . <a ref='Ruth 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>famine.</b> This disaster sounds similar to the days of Abraham ( <a ref='Ge 12'>Ge 12</a> ), Isaac ( <a ref='Ge 26'>Ge 26</a> ), and Jacob ( <a ref='Ge 46'>Ge 46</a> ). The text does not specify whether or not this famine was God’s judgment (cf. <a ref='1Ki 17-18'>1Ki 17–18</a> , esp. <a ref='1 Kings 18:2'>18:2</a> ). <b>Bethlehem in Judah.</b> Bethlehem (“house of bread”) lies in the territory given to the tribe of Judah ( <a ref='Jos 15'>Jos 15</a> ) about 6 mi. south of Jerusalem. Rachel, the wife of Jacob, was buried nearby ( <a ref='Genesis 35:19'>Ge 35:19</a> ; cf. <a ref='Ruth 4:11'>4:11</a> ). Bethlehem eventually received the title “city of David” ( <a ref='Luke 2:4'>Lk 2:4</a> , <a ref='Luke 2:11'>11</a> ). Later, Mary delivered Christ ( <a ref='Luke 2:4–7'>Lk 2:4–7</a> ; cf. <a ref='Micah 5:2'>Mic 5:2</a> ), and Herod slaughtered the infants here ( <a ref='Matthew 2:16'>Mt 2:16</a> ). This title ( <a ref='Judges 17:7'>Jdg 17:7</a> , <a ref='Judges 17:9'>9</a> ; <a ref='Judges 19:1–2'>19:1–2</a> , <a ref='Judges 19:18'>18</a> ) serves to distinguish it from Bethlehem of Zebulun ( <a ref='Joshua 19:15'>Jos 19:15</a> ). <b>sojourn.</b> Elimelech intended to live temporarily in Moab as a resident alien until the famine passed. <b>Moab.</b> See Introduction: Background and Setting . Ruth in Moab and Judah Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Ruth 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>Elimelech.</b> His name means “my God is king,” signifying a devout commitment to the God of Israel. Most likely, he was a prominent man in the community whose brothers might have included the unnamed close relative and Boaz (cf. <a ref='Ruth 4:3'>4:3</a> ). <b>Naomi.</b> Her name means “pleasant.” <b>Mahlon and Chilion.</b> Their names mean “sick” and “pining” respectively. <b>Ephrathites.</b> A title used of people who lived in the area anciently known as Ephrath ( <a ref='Genesis 35:16'>Ge 35:16</a> , <a ref='Genesis 35:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 48:7'>48:7</a> ) or Ephrathah ( <a ref='Ruth 4:11'>Ru 4:11</a> ; <a ref='Micah 5:2'>Mic 5:2</a> ), but later more prominently called Bethlehem ( <a ref='Ruth 1:1'>1:1</a> ). Jesse, father of David, is called “an Ephrathite of Bethlehem” ( <a ref='1 Samuel 17:12'>1Sa 17:12</a> ) and “Jesse the Bethlehemite” ( <a ref='1 Samuel 16:1'>1Sa 16:1</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 16:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 17:58'>17:58</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>Moabite women.</b> See Introduction: Interpretive Challenges . <b>Orpah.</b> Her name means “stubborn.” <b>Ruth.</b> Her name means “friendship.” <b>about ten years.</b> This period would seem to include the entire time of Naomi’s residency in Moab. <a ref='Ruth 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>woman was left without.</b> Naomi, a widow in Moab whose two sons had died also, believed that Yahweh had afflicted her with bitter days until she would die ( <a ref='Ruth 1:13'>1:13</a> , <a ref='Ruth 1:20'>20</a> , <a ref='Ruth 1:21'>21</a> ). No reason for the death of these 3 men in her life is given. Ruth married Mahlon, and Orpah united with Chilion (cf. <a ref='Ruth 4:10'>4:10</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 1:6–22'>1:6–22</a> The death of Elimelech and his two sons ( <a ref='Ruth 1:3'>1:3</a> , <a ref='Ruth 1:5'>5</a> ) prepared the way for Naomi and Ruth to leave Orpah in Moab ( <a ref='Ruth 1:6–14'>1:6–14</a> ) and return together to Bethlehem ( <a ref='Ruth 1:15–22'>1:15–22</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 1:6'>1:6</a> <b>Yahweh had visited His people.</b> Obviously Yahweh had sent rain to break the famine. The sovereignty of Jehovah on behalf of Israel permeates the pages of Ruth in several ways: 1) actually for good ( <a ref='Ruth 2:12'>2:12</a> ; <a ref='Ruth 4:12–14'>4:12–14</a> ), 2) perceived by Naomi for bad ( <a ref='Ruth 1:13'>1:13</a> , <a ref='Ruth 1:21'>21</a> ), and 3) in the context of prayer/blessing ( <a ref='Ruth 1:8–9'>1:8–9</a> , <a ref='Ruth 1:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Ruth 2:4'>2:4</a> , <a ref='Ruth 2:12'>12</a> , <a ref='Ruth 2:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Ruth 3:10'>3:10</a> , <a ref='Ruth 3:13'>13</a> ; <a ref='Ruth 4:11'>4:11</a> ). The return of physical prosperity only shadowed the reality of a coming spiritual prosperity through the line of David in the person of Christ. <a ref='Ruth 1:7'>1:7</a> <b>she went forth.</b> Naomi had friends ( <a ref='Ruth 1:19'>1:19</a> ), family ( <a ref='Ruth 2:1'>2:1</a> ), and prosperity ( <a ref='Ruth 4:3'>4:3</a> ) awaiting her in Bethlehem. <a ref='Ruth 1:8–10'>1:8–10</a> Naomi graciously encouraged her two daughters-in-law to return to their homes ( <a ref='Ruth 1:8'>1:8</a> ) and to remarry ( <a ref='Ruth 1:9'>1:9</a> ), but they emotionally insisted on going to Jerusalem ( <a ref='Ruth 1:10'>1:10</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 1:11–13'>1:11–13</a> Naomi selflessly reasoned a second time for their return, because she would be unable to provide them with new husbands (possibly in the spirit of a levirate marriage as described in <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:5–6'>Dt 25:5–6</a> ). If Orpah and Ruth waited, they would most likely have become as old as Naomi was then before they could remarry (cf. <a ref='Genesis 38:11'>Ge 38:11</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>I am too old.</b> Naomi was probably over 50. <a ref='Ruth 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>the hand of Yahweh.</b> A figure of speech which describes Yahweh’s work. Yahweh is spirit ( <a ref='John 4:24'>Jn 4:24</a> ) and therefore does not have a literal hand. <a ref='Ruth 1:14–15'>1:14–15</a> At the second plea to return, Orpah turned back. Naomi pleaded with Ruth a third time to return. <a ref='Ruth 1:15'>1:15</a> <b>her gods.</b> Refers to Chemosh the chief Moabite deity who required child sacrifice ( <a ref='2 Kings 3:27'>2Ki 3:27</a> ) and other local deities. <a ref='Ruth 1:16–18'>1:16–18</a> Ruth recited her hallmark expression of loyalty to Naomi and commitment to the family she married into. <a ref='Ruth 1:16'>1:16</a> <b>and your God, my God.</b> This testimony evidenced Ruth’s conversion from worshiping Chemosh to Jehovah of Israel (cf. <a ref='1 Thessalonians 1:9–10'>1Th 1:9–10</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 1:17'>1:17</a> <b>Yahweh do to me.</b> Ruth’s vow bore further testimony to her conversion. She followed the path first blazed by Abraham ( <a ref='Joshua 24:2'>Jos 24:2</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 1:19'>1:19</a> <b>they came to Bethlehem.</b> A trip from Moab (at least 60–75 mi.) would have taken about 7–10 days. Having descended about 4,500 ft. from Moab into the Jordan Valley, they then ascended 3,750 ft. through the hills of Judea. <b>all the city.</b> Naomi had been well known in her prior residency (cf. Ephrathites of Bethlehem, <a ref='Ruth 1:2'>1:2</a> ). The question, “Is this Naomi?” most likely reflected the hard life of the last decade and the toll that it took on her appearance. <a ref='Ruth 1:20–21'>1:20–21</a> <b>Naomi … Mara … full … empty.</b> Naomi’s outlook on life, although grounded in God’s sovereignty, was not hopeful; thus she asked to be renamed “Mara,” which means “bitter.” Her experiences were not unlike Job’s ( <a ref='Job 1-2'>Job 1–2</a> ), but her perspective resembled that of Job’s wife ( <a ref='Job 2:10'>Job 2:10</a> ). In reality, Naomi had 1) a full harvest prospect, 2) Ruth plus Boaz, and 3) the hope of God’s future blessing. <a ref='Ruth 1:22'>1:22</a> <b>Ruth the Moabitess.</b> This title also appears at <a ref='Ruth 2:2'>2:2</a> , <a ref='Ruth 2:21'>21</a> ; <a ref='Ruth 4:5'>4:5</a> , <a ref='Ruth 4:10'>10</a> . Ruth stands out as a foretaste of future Gentile conversions (cf. <a ref='Ro 11'>Ro 11</a> ). <b>at the beginning of barley harvest.</b> Normally the middle to the end of Apr. <a ref='Ruth 2:1–23'>2:1–23</a> Two widows, newly at home in Bethlehem after Naomi’s 10-year absence, needed the basics of life. Ruth volunteered to go out and glean the fields for food (cf. <a ref='James 1:27'>Jas 1:27</a> ). In so doing, she unintentionally went to the field of Boaz, a close family relative, where she found great favor in his sight. <a ref='Ruth 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>kinsman of her husband.</b> Possibly as close as a brother of Elimelech (cf. <a ref='Ruth 4:3'>4:3</a> ), but if not, certainly within the tribe or clan. <b>a mighty man of excellence.</b> Lit. “a man of valor” (cf. <a ref='Judges 6:12'>Jdg 6:12</a> ; <a ref='Judges 11:1'>11:1</a> ) who had unusual capacity to obtain and protect his property. <b>Boaz.</b> His name means “in him is strength.” He had never married or was a widower (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 2:11–12'>1Chr 2:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 1:5'>Mt 1:5</a> ; <a ref='Luke 3:32'>Lk 3:32</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>glean.</b> The Mosaic law commanded that the harvest should not be reaped to the corners nor the gleanings picked up ( <a ref='Leviticus 19:9–10'>Lv 19:9–10</a> ). Gleanings were stalks of grain left after the first cutting (cf. <a ref='Ruth 2:3'>2:3</a> , <a ref='Ruth 2:7–8'>7–8</a> , <a ref='Ruth 2:15'>15</a> , <a ref='Ruth 2:17'>17</a> ). These were dedicated to the needy, especially widows, orphans, and strangers ( <a ref='Leviticus 23:22'>Lv 23:22</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:19–21'>Dt 24:19–21</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 2:3'>2:3</a> <b>she happened</b> to come <b>.</b> Here was a classic example of God’s providence at work. <b>portion of the field.</b> Possibly a large community field in which Boaz had a plot. <a ref='Ruth 2:4–17'>2:4–17</a> Note throughout how Boaz manifested the spirit of the law in going beyond what the Mosaic legislation required by 1) feeding Ruth ( <a ref='Ruth 2:14'>2:14</a> ), 2) letting Ruth glean among the sheaves ( <a ref='Ruth 2:15'>2:15</a> ), and 3) leaving extra grain for her to glean ( <a ref='Ruth 2:16'>2:16</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 2:4'>2:4</a> <b>Yahweh be with you.</b> This unusual labor practice speaks to the exceptional godliness of Boaz and his workers. <a ref='Ruth 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>sheaves.</b> Bundles of grain stalks tied together for transport to the threshing floor. <a ref='Ruth 2:7'>2:7</a> , <a ref='Ruth 2:17'>17</a> <b>morning … evening.</b> Ruth proved to be diligent in her care for Naomi. <a ref='Ruth 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>the house.</b> Most likely a temporary shelter built with branches by the side of the field. <a ref='Ruth 2:8'>2:8</a> <b>my daughter.</b> Boaz was about 45–55 years old and a contemporary of Elimelech and Naomi. He would naturally see Ruth as a daughter ( <a ref='Ruth 3:10–11'>3:10–11</a> ), much like Naomi did (cf. <a ref='Ruth 2:2'>2:2</a> , <a ref='Ruth 2:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Ruth 3:1'>3:1</a> , <a ref='Ruth 3:16'>16</a> , <a ref='Ruth 3:18'>18</a> ). Boaz contrasted himself with younger men ( <a ref='Ruth 3:10'>3:10</a> ). <b>my young women.</b> The ones who tied up the sheaves. <a ref='Ruth 2:9'>2:9</a> <b>the young men.</b> The ones who cut the grain with hand sickles (cf. <a ref='Ruth 2:21'>2:21</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 2:10'>2:10</a> <b>a foreigner.</b> Ruth remained ever mindful that she was an alien and, as such, must conduct herself humbly. Possibly she had knowledge of <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:3–4'>Dt 23:3–4</a> . She acknowledged the grace (lit. “favor”) of Boaz. <a ref='Ruth 2:11'>2:11</a> <b>fully told to me.</b> This speaks to both Naomi’s quickness to speak kindly of Ruth and Boaz’s network of influence in Bethlehem. Ruth remained true to her promise ( <a ref='Ruth 1:16–17'>1:16–17</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 2:12'>2:12</a> <b>wings … refuge.</b> Scripture pictures God as catching Israel up on His wings in the Exodus ( <a ref='Exodus 19:4'>Ex 19:4</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:11'>Dt 32:11</a> ). God is here portrayed as a mother bird sheltering the young and fragile with her wings (cf. <a ref='Psalms 17:8'>Pss 17:8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 36:7'>36:7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 57:1'>57:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 61:4'>61:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 63:7'>63:7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 91:1'>91:1</a> , <a ref='Psalms 91:4'>4</a> ). Boaz blessed Ruth in light of her newfound commitment to and dependence on Yahweh. Later, he would become God’s answer to this prayer (cf. <a ref='Ruth 3:9'>3:9</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 2:14'>2:14</a> <b>vinegar.</b> Sour wine, mixed with a little oil, used to quench thirst. <a ref='Ruth 2:15'>2:15</a> <b>among the sheaves.</b> Boaz granted her request ( <a ref='Ruth 2:7'>2:7</a> ) to go beyond the letter of the law. <a ref='Ruth 2:17'>2:17</a> <b>ephah.</b> Over one-half bushel, weighing about 30 to 40 lbs. <a ref='Ruth 2:18'>2:18</a> <b>what she had left.</b> Not the gleaned grain, but rather the lunch ration which Ruth did not eat (cf. <a ref='Ruth 2:14'>2:14</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 2:20'>2:20</a> <b>his lovingkindness.</b> Naomi began to understand God’s sovereign working, covenant loyalty, lovingkindness, and mercy toward her because Ruth, without human direction ( <a ref='Ruth 2:3'>2:3</a> ), found the near relative Boaz. <b>one of our</b> kinsman <b>redeemers.</b> The great kinsman-redeemer theme of Ruth begins here (cf. <a ref='Ruth 3:9'>3:9</a> , <a ref='Ruth 3:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Ruth 4:1'>4:1</a> , <a ref='Ruth 4:3'>3</a> , <a ref='Ruth 4:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Ruth 4:8'>8</a> , <a ref='Ruth 4:14'>14</a> ). A close relative could redeem 1) a family member sold into slavery ( <a ref='Leviticus 25:47–49'>Lv 25:47–49</a> ), 2) land which needed to be sold under economic hardship ( <a ref='Leviticus 25:23–28'>Lv 25:23–28</a> ), and/or 3) the family name by virtue of a levirate marriage ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:5–10'>Dt 25:5–10</a> ). This earthly custom pictures the reality of God the Redeemer doing a greater work ( <a ref='Psalms 19:14'>Pss 19:14</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 78:35'>78:35</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 41:14'>Is 41:14</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 43:14'>43:14</a> ) by reclaiming those who needed to be spiritually redeemed out of slavery to sin ( <a ref='Psalms 107:2'>Ps 107:2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 62:12'>Is 62:12</a> ). Thus, Boaz pictures Christ, who as a Brother ( <a ref='Hebrews 2:17'>Heb 2:17</a> ), redeemed those who 1) were slaves to sin ( <a ref='Romans 6:15–18'>Ro 6:15–18</a> ), 2) had lost all earthly possessions/privileges in the Fall ( <a ref='Genesis 3:17–19'>Ge 3:17–19</a> ), and 3) had been alienated by sin from God ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:18–21'>2Co 5:18–21</a> ). Boaz stands in the direct line of Christ ( <a ref='Matthew 1:5'>Mt 1:5</a> ; <a ref='Luke 3:32'>Lk 3:32</a> ). This turn of events marks the point where Naomi’s human emptiness ( <a ref='Ruth 1:21'>1:21</a> ) begins to be refilled by Yahweh. Her night of earthly doubt has been broken by the dawning of new hope (cf. <a ref='Romans 8:28–39'>Ro 8:28–39</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 2:22'>2:22</a> <b>do not oppress you.</b> Ruth the Moabitess would not be treated with such mercy and grace by strangers outside of the family. <a ref='Ruth 2:23'>2:23</a> <b>the end of … harvest.</b> Barley harvest usually began about mid-Apr. and wheat harvest extended to mid-June—a period of intense labor for about two months. This generally coincided with the 7 weeks between Passover and the Feast of Weeks, i.e., Pentecost (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 23:15–16'>Lv 23:15–16</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:9–12'>Dt 16:9–12</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 3:1–18'>3:1–18</a> Encouraged by Ruth’s days in Boaz’s field, Naomi instructed Ruth in the way she should go to ensure a brighter future. Ruth carefully followed Naomi’s directions to solicit redemption by Boaz, while Yahweh had prepared Boaz to redeem Ruth. Only one potential obstacle remained, a relative nearer than Boaz. <a ref='Ruth 3:1'>3:1</a> a state of <b>rest.</b> Naomi felt responsible, just as she did in <a ref='Ruth 1:9'>1:9</a> , for Ruth’s future husband and home. <a ref='Ruth 3:2'>3:2</a> <b>threshing floor.</b> Usually a large, hard area of earth or stone on the downwind (E) side of the village where threshing took place (loosening the grain from the straw and winnowing). <b>tonight.</b> Winnowing (tossing grain into the air to finish separating the grain from the chaff) normally occurred in late afternoon when the Mediterranean winds prevailed. Sifting and bagging the grain would have carried over past dark, and Boaz may have remained all night to guard the grain from theft. <a ref='Ruth 3:3–4'>3:3–4</a> Naomi instructed <a ref='Ru 1'>Ruth 1</a> ) to put on her best appearance and 2) to propose marriage to Boaz by utilizing an ancient Near Eastern custom. Since Boaz was a generation older than Ruth ( <a ref='Ruth 2:8'>2:8</a> ), this overture would indicate Ruth’s desire to marry Boaz, which the older, gracious Boaz would not have initiated with a younger woman. <a ref='Ruth 3:7'>3:7</a> <b>his heart was merry.</b> Using the same language of <a ref='Ruth 3:1'>3:1</a> (“security” … “be well”), Boaz is described as having a sense of well-being, which is most readily explained by the full harvest in contrast to previous years of famine (cf. <a ref='Judges 18:20'>Jdg 18:20</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 21:7'>1Ki 21:7</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 3:9'>3:9</a> <b>spread your wing over your maidservant.</b> Ruth righteously appealed to Boaz, using the language of Boaz’s earlier prayer ( <a ref='Ruth 2:12'>2:12</a> ), to marry her according to the levirate custom ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:5–10'>Dt 25:5–10</a> ). See Introduction: Interpretive Challenges . <a ref='Ruth 3:10'>3:10</a> <b>lovingkindness.</b> Ruth’s loyalty to Naomi, Yahweh, and even Boaz is commended by Boaz. <b>after young men.</b> Ruth demonstrated moral excellence in that 1) she did not engage in immorality, 2) she did not remarry outside the family, and 3) she had appealed for levirate redemption to an older, godly man. <a ref='Ruth 3:11'>3:11</a> <b>excellence.</b> In all respects, Ruth personifies excellence (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 31:10'>Pr 31:10</a> ). This same language has been used of Boaz (“a man of great wealth” or more likely “a man of valor” in <a ref='Ruth 2:1'>2:1</a> ), thus making them the perfectly matched couple for an exemplary marriage. <a ref='Ruth 3:12'>3:12</a> <b>a</b> kinsman <b>redeemer closer than I.</b> Boaz righteously deferred to someone else who was nearer in relationship to Elimelech. The nearer relative may have been Boaz’s older brother (cf. <a ref='Ruth 4:3'>4:3</a> ), or Boaz may have been his cousin. The fact that the neighbor women said, “A son has been born to Naomi” at Obed’s birth would suggest the brother or cousin relationship to Elimelech ( <a ref='Ruth 4:17'>4:17</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 3:13'>3:13</a> <b>I will redeem you.</b> Boaz willingly accepted Ruth’s proposal, if the nearer relative was unable or unwilling to exercise his levirate duty. <b>as Yahweh lives.</b> The most solemn, binding oath an Israelite could vow. <a ref='Ruth 3:14'>3:14</a> <b>lay at his feet.</b> According to the text, no immorality occurred. Boaz even insisted on no appearance of evil. <a ref='Ruth 3:15'>3:15</a> <b>six</b> measures <b>.</b> The Hebrew text gives no standard of measurement, but some translations use the word <i>ephah</i> . However, 6 ephahs would weigh about 200 lbs., far too much for Ruth to carry home in her shawl. Therefore, deemed most reasonable is 6 seahs (60–80 lbs.), which would have been twice the amount Ruth had previously gleaned (see <a ref='Ruth 2:17'>2:17</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 3:18'>3:18</a> <b>today.</b> Naomi knew that Boaz was a man of integrity and would fulfill his promise with a sense of urgency. They needed to wait on Yahweh to work through Boaz. <a ref='Ruth 4:1–22'>4:1–22</a> God’s divine plan fully blossomed as Boaz redeemed Naomi’s land and Ruth’s hand in marriage. Naomi, once empty ( <a ref='Ruth 1:21'>1:21</a> ), is full; Ruth, once a widow ( <a ref='Ruth 1:5'>1:5</a> ), is married; most importantly, Yahweh has prepared Christ’s line of descent in David, through Boaz and Obed, back to Judah ( <a ref='Genesis 49:10'>Ge 49:10</a> ) to fulfill the proper messianic lineage. <a ref='Ruth 4:1'>4:1</a> <b>went up.</b> Apparently the threshing floor was below the level of the gate. Compare <a ref='Ruth 3:3'>Ru 3:3</a> , “go down to the threshing floor.” <b>the gate.</b> The normal public place to transact business in ancient times (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 15:2'>2Sa 15:2</a> ; <a ref='Job 29:7'>Job 29:7</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 5:14'>Lam 5:14</a> ). <b>my fellow.</b> The Hebrew text is not clear whether Boaz called him directly by name (which is then not mentioned by the author) or addressed him indirectly. Kinsman-Redeemer OT Qualification Christ’s Fulfillment 1. Blood Relationship <a ref='Galatians 4:4–5'>Ga 4:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 2:16–17'>Heb 2:16–17</a> 2.

Perhaps this exemplified Boaz’s desire to obey the spirit of the law ( <i>see note on <a ref='Ruth 2:4–17'>2:4–17</a></i> ) or maybe redemption of land and marriage had been combined by local tradition. The levirate principle appears first in Scripture at <a ref='Genesis 38:8'>Ge 38:8</a> (cf. <a ref='Matthew 22:23–28'>Mt 22:23–28</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 4:6'>4:6</a> <b>I ruin my own inheritance.</b> He was unwilling to have the family portfolio split between his existing children and the potential offspring of a union with Ruth. <b>You redeem my right of redemption for yourself.</b> The closer relative relinquished his legal right to the land and Ruth. This cleared the way for Boaz to redeem both. <a ref='Ruth 4:7'>4:7</a> <b>removed his sandal.</b> The Scripture writer explained to his own generation what had been a custom in former generations. This kind of tradition appears in <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:5–10'>Dt 25:5–10</a> and apparently continued at least to the time of Amos ( <a ref='Amos 2:6'>2:6</a> ; <a ref='Amos 8:6'>8:6</a> ). The closer relative legally transferred his right to the property as symbolized by the sandal, most likely that of the nearer relative. <a ref='Ruth 4:9'>4:9</a> <b>I have acquired.</b> Boaz exercised his legal option to redeem both the land and Ruth before appropriate witnesses. Ruth: The Proverbs 31 Wife The “excellent” wife of <a ref='Proverbs 31:10'>Proverbs 31:10</a> is personified by Ruth, “a woman of excellence,” of whom the same Hebrew word is used (3:11). With amazing parallel, they share at least 8 character traits (see below). One wonders (in concert with Jewish tradition) if King Lemuel’s mother might not have been Bathsheba, who orally passed the family heritage of Ruth’s spotless reputation along to David’s son Solomon. Lemuel, which means “devoted to God,” could have been a family name for Solomon (cf. Jedediah, <a ref='2 Samuel 12:25'>2Sa 12:25</a> ), who then could have penned <a ref='Proverbs 31:10–31'>Pr 31:10–31</a> with Ruth in mind. Each woman was: 1. Devoted to her family ( <a ref='Ruth 1:15–18'>Ru 1:15–18</a> // <a ref='Proverbs 31:10–12'>Pr 31:10–12</a> , <a ref='Proverbs 31:23'>23</a> ) 2.

This remembrance went back almost 900 years to ca. 1915 BC. <b>Ephrathah … Bethlehem.</b> The ancient name of Bethlehem ( <a ref='Genesis 35:19'>Ge 35:19</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 48:7'>48:7</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Ruth 1:2'>1:2</a> .</i> Micah later prophetically wrote that this city would be the birthplace of Messiah ( <a ref='Micah 5:2'>5:2</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 4:12'>4:12</a> <b>Perez … Tamar … Judah.</b> Read <a ref='Genesis 38:1–30'>Ge 38:1–30</a> for the background to these 3. Tamar, the widow of Judah’s first son, Er, when denied a levirate marriage to Judah’s remaining son, Shelah ( <a ref='Genesis 38:14'>38:14</a> ), took matters into her own hands and immorally consorted with her father-in-law Judah ( <a ref='Genesis 38:18'>38:18</a> ). Perez, the firstborn of twins by Tamar, became the main ancestor of the Ephrathites and Bethlehemites ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 2:3–5'>1Chr 2:3–5</a> , <a ref='1 Chronicles 2:19'>19</a> , <a ref='1 Chronicles 2:50–51'>50–51</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 4:4'>4:4</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Ruth 4:18'>4:18</a> .</i> <b>seed.</b> The firstborn son would be considered the son of Mahlon.

Obed means “servant.” <b>A son has been born to Naomi!</b> Ruth vicariously bore the son that would restore the family name of Naomi’s deceased son Mahlon (cf. <a ref='Ruth 4:1'>4:1</a> ). <b>Obed … Jesse … David.</b> This complete genealogy appears identically in 4 other biblical texts ( <a ref='Ruth 4:21–22'>Ru 4:21–22</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 2:12–15'>1Chr 2:12–15</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 1:5–6'>Mt 1:5–6</a> ; <a ref='Luke 3:31–32'>Lk 3:31–32</a> ).

The first 5 (Perez to Nashon) cover the patriarchal times to the Exodus and wilderness wanderings. Salmon to David covers Joshua’s lifetime and the judges to the monarchy. This genealogical compression by omission does not signal faulty records, because in Jewish thinking, “son” could mean “descendant” (cf. <a ref='Matthew 1:1'>Mt 1:1</a> ). The purpose of a family record was not necessarily to include every generation, but rather to establish incontestable succession by way of the more notable ancestors. <a ref='Ruth 4:18'>4:18</a> <b>Perez.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Ruth 4:12'>12</a> .</i> Although this genealogy only goes back to Perez, it conclusively establishes that David’s lineage extends further back through Judah ( <a ref='Genesis 49:8–12'>Ge 49:8–12</a> ), Jacob ( <a ref='Genesis 28:10–17'>Ge 28:10–17</a> ), and Isaac ( <a ref='Genesis 26:24'>Ge 26:24</a> ) to Abraham ( <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> ). <a ref='Ruth 4:18–19'>4:18–19</a> <b>Hezron.</b> Cf. <a ref='Genesis 46:12'>Ge 46:12</a> . <a ref='Ruth 4:19'>4:19</a> <b>Ram.</b> Listed as Arni in some Greek texts of <a ref='Luke 3:33'>Lk 3:33</a> . <a ref='Ruth 4:19–20'>4:19–20</a> <b>Amminadab.</b> The father-in-law of Aaron ( <a ref='Exodus 6:23'>Ex 6:23</a> ), who appears in <a ref='1 Chronicles 2:10'>1Chr 2:10</a> , and is cited in <a ref='Matthew 1:4'>Mt 1:4</a> and <a ref='Luke 3:33'>Lk 3:33</a> .
