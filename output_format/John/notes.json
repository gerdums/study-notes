Several key words repeated throughout the Gospel (e.g., life, light, witness, glory) appear here. The remainder of the Gospel develops the theme of the prologue as to how the eternal “Word” of God, Jesus the Messiah and Son of God, became flesh and ministered among men so that all who believe in Him would be saved. Although John wrote the prologue with the simplest vocabulary in the NT, the truths which the prologue conveys are the most profound. Six basic truths about Christ as the Son of God are featured in the prologue: 1) the eternal Christ (vv. 1–3 ); 2) the incarnate Christ (vv. 4–5 ); 3) the forerunner of Christ (vv. 6–8 ); 4) the unrecognized Christ (vv. 9–11 ); 5) the omnipotent Christ (vv. 12–13 ); and 6) the glorious Christ (vv. 14–18 )."

John introduces the reader to contrastive themes that occur throughout the Gospel. “Life” and “light” are qualities of the Word that are shared not only among the Godhead ( 5:26 ) but also by those who respond to the gospel message regarding Jesus Christ ( 8:12 ; 9:5 ; 10:28 ; 11:25 ; 14:6 ). John uses the word “life” about 42 times in his Gospel, far more than any other NT book. It refers not only in a broad sense to physical and temporal life that the Son imparted to the created world through His involvement as the agent of creation (v. 3 ), but especially to spiritual and eternal life imparted as a gift through belief in Him ( 3:15 ; 17:3 ; Eph 2:5 ). In Scripture “light” and “darkness” are very familiar symbols. Intellectually, “light” refers to biblical truth, while “darkness” refers to error or falsehood (cf. Ps 119:105 ; Pr 6:23 ). Morally, “light” refers to holiness or purity ( 1Jn 1:5 ), while “darkness” refers to sin or wrongdoing ( 3:19 ; 12:35 , 46 ; Ro 13:11–14 ; 1Th 5:4–7 ; 1Jn 1:6 ; 2:8–11 ). “Darkness” has special significance in relationship to Satan (and his demonic cohorts) who rules the present spiritually dark world ( 1Jn 5:19 ) as the “prince of the power of the air” promoting spiritual darkness and rebellion against God ( Eph 2:2 ). John uses the term “darkness” 14 times (8 in the Gospel and 6 in 1 John) out of its 17 occurrences in the NT, making it almost an exclusive Johannine word. In John, “light” and “life” have their special significance in relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Word (v. 9 ; 9:5 ; 1Jn 1:5–7 ; 5:12 , 20 )."

The name “John” always refers to John the Baptist in this Gospel, never to the apostle John. The writer of this Gospel calls him merely “John” without using the phrase “the Baptist,” unlike the other Gospels which use the additional description to identify him ( Mt 3:1 ; Mk 6:14 ; Lk 7:20 ). Moreover, John the apostle (or, son of Zebedee) never identified himself directly by name in the Gospel even though he was one of the 3 most intimate associates of Jesus ( Mt 17:1 ).

Not only did John the Baptist witness regarding Jesus as Messiah and Son of God (vv. 19–34 ; 3:27–30 ; 5:35 ), but there were other witnesses: 1) the Samaritan woman ( 4:29 ); 2) the works of Jesus ( 10:25 ); 3) the Father ( 5:32–37 ); 4) the OT ( 5:39–40 ); 5) the crowd ( 12:17 ); and 6) the Holy Spirit ( 15:26–27 ). that all might believe through him. “Him” refers not to Christ but to John as the agent who witnessed to Christ.

God has planted His knowledge in man through general revelation in creation and conscience. The result of general revelation, however, does not produce salvation but either leads to the complete light of Jesus Christ or produces condemnation in those who reject such “light” ( see notes on Ro 1:19–20 ; 2:12–16 ). The coming of Jesus Christ was the fulfillment and embodiment of the light that God had placed inside the heart of man. the world. The basic sense of this Greek word meaning “an ornament” is illustrated by the word “adornment” ( 1Pe 3:3 ). While the NT uses it a total of 185 times, John had a particular fondness for this term, using it 78 times in his Gospel, 24 times in 1-3 John and 3 times in Revelation. John gives it several shades of meaning: 1) the physical created universe (v. 9 ; cf. v. 3 ; 21:24–25 ); 2) humanity in general ( 3:16 ; 6:33 , 51 ; 12:19 ); and 3) the invisible spiritual system of evil dominated by Satan and all that it offers in opposition to God, His Word, and His people ( 3:19 ; 4:42 ; 7:7 ; 14:17 , 22 , 27 , 30 ; 15:18–19 ; 16:8 , 20 , 33 ; 17:6 , 9 , 14 ; cf. 1Co 1:21 ; 2Pe 1:4 ; 1Jn 5:19 ).

While Christ as God is uncreated and eternal ( see notes on v. 1 ), the word “became” emphasizes Christ’s taking on humanity (cf. Heb 1:1–3 ; 2:14–18 ). This reality is surely the most profound ever because it indicates that, in the incarnation, the Word did not cease to be God but became God in human flesh, i.e., undiminished deity in human form as a man ( 1 Ti 3:16 ). Because He has two natures (divine and human), He is both infinite and finite, eternal and temporal, invisible and visible, uncreated and created. dwelt. Meaning “to pitch a tabernacle,” or “live in a tent.” The term recalls to mind the OT tabernacle where God met with Israel before the temple was constructed ( Ex 25:8 ). It was called the “tent of meeting” ( Ex 33:7 ; “tabernacle of witness”—LXX) where “Yahweh used to speak to Moses face to face, just as a man speaks to his friend” ( Ex 33:11 ). In the NT, God chose to dwell among His people in a far more personal way through becoming a man. In the OT, when the tabernacle was completed, God’s Shekinah presence filled the entire structure ( Ex 40:34 ; cf. 1Ki 8:10 ). When the Word became flesh, the glorious presence of deity was embodied in Him (cf. Col 2:9 ). we beheld His glory. Although His deity may have been veiled in human flesh, glimpses exist in the Gospels of His divine majesty. The disciples saw glimpses of His glory on the Mount of Transfiguration ( Mt 17:1–8 ). The reference to Christ’s glory, however, was not only visible but also spiritual. They saw Him display the attributes or characteristics of God (grace, goodness, mercy, wisdom, truth, etc.; cf. Ex 33:18–23 ). glory as of … the Father. Jesus as God displayed the same essential glory as the Father. They are one in essential nature (cf. 5:17–30 ; 8:19 ; 10:30 ). only begotten. This expression speaks of singular uniqueness. It normally signifies an only child. The same Greek term is used in Lk 7:12 ; 8:42 ; 9:38 —but also used of Isaac ( Heb 11:17 ) though he was Abraham’s second son (cf. Ge 16:15 with Ge 21:2–3 ). John applies the term to Christ in order to signify the exclusive character of the relationship between Father and Son in the Godhead: Christ is eternally begotten by the Father (cf. Ps 2:7 ; Jn 3:16 , Jn 3:18 ; 1Jn 4:9 ; note on Heb 1:5 ). Clearly, this does not mean that the Son had a beginning (vv. 1–3 ). Rather, it connotes the incomprehensible way the divine essence is eternally communicated from the Father to “the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father” (v 18 ; cf. Jn 5:26 ). full of grace and truth. John probably had Ex 33–34 in mind. On that occasion, Moses requested that God display His glory to him. The Lord replied to Moses that He would make all His “goodness” pass before him, and then as He passed by God declared “Yahweh … compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness and truth” ( Ex 33:18–19 ; 34:5–7 ). These attributes of God’s glory emphasize the goodness of God’s character, especially in relationship to salvation. Jesus as Yahweh of the OT ( 8:58 ; “I am”) displayed the same divine attributes when He tabernacled among men in the NT era ( Col 2:9 )."

The historical circumstances and literary contexts of the two temple cleansings differ so widely that attempts to equate the two are unsuccessful.

Their moderate nature is evident in that there was no mass uprising from the crowd, nor any response from the Roman soldiers stationed at the nearby Antonia Fortress, in town to manage the large crowds during Passover. Although the primary reference is to the actions of the Messiah in the millennial kingdom, Jesus’ actions in cleansing the temple were an initial fulfillment of Mal 3:1–3 (and Zec 14:20–21 ) that speak of Messiah’s purifying the religious worship of His people."

Since the Pharisees were supernaturalists, they naturally and eagerly expected the coming of the prophesied resurrection of the saints and institution of the messianic kingdom ( Is 11:1–16 ; Da 12:2 ). Their problem was that they thought that mere physical lineage and keeping of religious externals qualified them for entrance into the kingdom rather than the needed spiritual transformation which Jesus emphasized (cf. 8:33–39 ; Ga 6:15 ).

Even with the strong antipathy between Jews and Samaritans, the Jewish historian Josephus relates that the custom of Judeans at the time of the great festivals was to travel through the country of the Samaritans because it was the shorter route. Although the verb “had to” may possibly refer to the fact that Jesus wanted to save time and needless steps, because of the Gospel’s emphasis on the Lord’s consciousness of fulfilling His Father’s plan ( 2:4 ; 7:30 ; 8:20 ; 12:23 ; 13:1 ; 14:31 ), the apostle may have been highlighting divine, spiritual necessity, i.e., Jesus had an appointment with divine destiny in meeting the Samaritan woman, to whom He would reveal His messiahship. Samaria. When the nation of Israel split politically after Solomon’s rule, King Omri named the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel “Samaria” ( 1Ki 16:24 ). The name eventually referred to the entire district and sometimes to the entire northern kingdom, which had been taken captive (capital, Samaria) by Assyria in 722 BC ( 2Ki 17:1–6 ). While Assyria led most of the populace of the 10 northern tribes away (into the region which today is northern Iraq), it left a sizable population of Jews in the northern Samaritan region and transported many non-Jews into Samaria. These groups intermingled to form a mixed race through intermarriage. Eventually, tension developed between the Jews who returned from captivity and the Samaritans. The Samaritans withdrew from the worship of Yahweh at Jerusalem and established their worship at Mt. Gerizim in Samaria (vv. 20–22 ). Samaritans regarded only the Pentateuch as authoritative. As a result of this history, Jews repudiated Samaritans and considered them heretical. Intense ethnic and cultural tensions raged historically between the two groups so that both avoided contact as much as possible (v. 9 ; Ezr 4:1–24 ; Ne 4:1–6 ; Lk 10:25–37 ). See note on 2Ki 17:24 ."

The vocabulary and style of the section also are different from the rest of the Gospel, and the section interrupts the sequence of v. 52 with 8:12ff. Many, however, do think that it has all the earmarks of historical veracity, perhaps being a piece of oral tradition that circulated in parts of the western church, so that a few comments are in order. In spite of all these considerations of the likely unreliability of this section, it is possible to be wrong on the issue, and thus it is good to consider the meaning of this passage and leave it in the text, just as with Mk 16:9–20 ."

Hosanna! The term “hosanna” is a transliteration of a Hebrew word that means “give salvation now.” It was a term of acclamation or praise occurring in Ps 118:25 which was familiar to every Jew, since that psalm was part of the Hallel ( Pss 113–118 ) sung each morning by the temple choir during the Feast of Tabernacles ( 7:37 ) and associated with the Feast of Dedication ( 10:22 ) and especially the Passover. After shouting out the “Hosanna,” the crowds shouted Ps 118:26 ; significantly, the original context of Ps 118 may well have been the pronouncement of blessing upon a Davidic king. Jewish commentaries have understood the verse to bear messianic implications. “ He who comes in the name of the Lord ” refers to Messiah, especially in context with the phrase, “the King of Israel,” though that messianic title is not from Ps 118 ."

The vine has two types of branches: 1) branches that bear fruit (vv. 2 , 8 ), and 2) branches that do not (vv. 2 , 6 ). The branches that bear fruit are genuine believers. Though in immediate context the focus is upon the 11 faithful disciples, the imagery also encompasses all believers down through the ages. The branches that do not bear fruit are those who profess to believe, but their lack of fruit indicates genuine salvation has never taken place and they have no life from the vine. Especially in the immediate context, Judas was in view, but the imagery extends from him to all those who make a profession of faith in Christ but do not actually possess salvation.

The prayer recorded here is truly the Lord’s Prayer, exhibiting the face-to-face communion the Son had with the Father. Very little is recorded of the content of Jesus’ frequent prayers to the Father ( Mt 14:23 ; Lk 5:16 ), so this prayer reveals some of the precious content of the Son’s communion and intercession with Him. This chapter is a transitional chapter, marking the end of Jesus’ earthly ministry and the beginning of His intercessory ministry for believers ( Heb 7:25 ). In many respects, the prayer is a summary of John’s entire Gospel. Its principal themes include: 1) Jesus’ obedience to His Father; 2) the glorification of His Father through His death and exaltation; 3) the revelation of God in Jesus Christ; 4) the choosing of the disciples out of the world; 5) their mission to the world; 6) their unity modeled on the unity of the Father and Son; and 7) the believer’s final destiny in the presence of the Father and Son. The chapter divides into three parts: 1) Jesus’ prayer for Himself (vv. 1–5 ); 2) Jesus’ prayer for the apostles (vv. 6–19 ); and 3) Jesus’ prayer for all NT believers who will form the church (vv. 20–26 )."

The epilogue essentially ties up 5 loose ends that were unanswered in chap. 20 . 1) Will Jesus no longer directly provide for His own (cf. 20:17 )? This question is answered in vv. 1–14 . 2) What happened to Peter? Peter had denied Christ 3 times and fled. The last time Peter was seen was in 20:6–8 where both he and John saw the empty tomb, but only John believed ( 20:8 ). This question is answered in vv. 15–17 . 3) What about the future of the disciples now that they are without their Master? This question is answered in vv. 18–19 . 4) Was John going to die? Jesus answers this question in vv. 20–23 . 5) Why weren’t other things that Jesus did recorded by John? John gives the answer to that in vv. 24–25 ."

In terms of interpretation, when two synonyms are placed in close proximity in context, a difference in meaning, however slight, is emphasized. When Jesus asked Peter if he loved Him, He used a word for love that signified total commitment. Peter responded with a word for love that signified his love for Jesus, but not necessarily his total commitment. This was not because he was reluctant to express that greater love, but because he had been disobedient and denied the Lord in the past. He was, perhaps, now reluctant to make a claim of supreme devotion when, in the past, his life did not support such a claim. Jesus pressed home to Peter the need for unswerving devotion by repeatedly asking Peter if he loved Him supremely. The essential message here is that Jesus demands total commitment from His followers. Their love for Him must place Him above their love for all else. Jesus confronted Peter with love because He wanted Peter to lead the apostles ( Mt 16:18 ), but in order for Peter to be an effective shepherd, his overwhelming drive must exemplify supreme love for his Lord."

Peter lived 3 decades serving the Lord and anticipating the death that was before him ( 2Pe 1:12–15 ), but he wrote that such suffering and death for the Lord brings praise to God ( 1Pe 4:14–16 ).
