    "content": "The Book of Jeremiah Title This book gains its title from the human author, who begins with “the words of Jeremiah.…” ( <a ref='Jeremiah 1:1'>1:1</a> ). Jeremiah recounts more of his own life than any other prophet, telling of his ministry, the reactions of his audiences, testings, and his personal feelings. His name means “Jehovah throws,” in the sense of laying down a foundation, or “Jehovah establishes, appoints, or sends.” Seven other Jeremiahs appear in Scripture ( <a ref='2 Kings 23:31'>2Ki 23:31</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 5:24'>1Chr 5:24</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 12:4'>12:4</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 12:10'>12:10</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 12:13'>12:13</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 10:2'>Ne 10:2</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 12:1'>12:1</a> ), and Jeremiah the prophet is named at least 9 times outside of his book (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:25'>2Chr 35:25</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:12'>36:12</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:21–22'>36:21–22</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 1:1'>Ezr 1:1</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:2'>Da 9:2</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 2:17'>Mt 2:17</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 16:14'>16:14</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 27:9'>27:9</a> ). The Old and New Testaments quote Jeremiah at least 7 times: 1) <a ref='Daniel 9:2'>Da 9:2</a> ( <a ref='Jeremiah 25:11–12'>25:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 29:10'>29:10</a> ); 2) <a ref='Matthew 2:18'>Mt 2:18</a> ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:15'>31:15</a> ); 3) <a ref='Matthew 27:9'>Mt 27:9</a> ( <a ref='Jeremiah 18:2'>18:2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 19:2'>19:2</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 19:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 32:6–9'>32:6–9</a> ); 4) <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:31'>1Co 1:31</a> ( <a ref='Jeremiah 9:24'>9:24</a> ); 5) <a ref='2 Corinthians 10:17'>2Co 10:17</a> ( <a ref='Jeremiah 9:24'>9:24</a> ); 6) <a ref='Hebrews 8:8–12'>Heb 8:8–12</a> ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>31:31–34</a> ); and 7) <a ref='Hebrews 10:16–17'>Heb 10:16–17</a> ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:33–34'>31:33–34</a> ). Author and Date Jeremiah, who served as both a priest and a prophet, was the son of a priest named Hilkiah (not the High Priest of <a ref='2 Kings 22:8'>2Ki 22:8</a> who discovered the Book of the Law). He was from the small village of Anathoth ( <a ref='Jeremiah 1:1'>1:1</a> ), today called Anata, about 3 mi. northeast of Jerusalem in Benjamin’s tribal inheritance. As an object lesson to Judah, Jeremiah remained unmarried ( <a ref='Jeremiah 16:1–4'>16:1–4</a> ). He was assisted in ministry by a scribe, named Baruch, to whom Jeremiah dictated and who copied and had custody over the writings compiled from the prophet’s messages ( <a ref='Jeremiah 36:4'>36:4</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 36:32'>32</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 45:1'>45:1</a> ). Jeremiah has been known as “the weeping prophet” (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 9:1'>9:1</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 13:17'>13:17</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 14:17'>14:17</a> ), living a life of conflict because of his predictions of judgment by the invading Babylonians. He was threatened, tried for his life, put in stocks, forced to flee from Jehoiakim, publicly humiliated by a false prophet, and thrown into a pit. Jeremiah carried out a ministry directed mostly to his own people in Judah, but which expanded to other nations at times. He appealed to his countrymen to repent and avoid God’s judgment via an invader (chaps. <a ref='Je 7'>7</a> , <a ref='Je 26'>26</a> ). Once invasion was certain after Judah refused to repent, he pled with them not to resist the Babylonian conqueror in order to prevent total destruction (chap. <a ref='Je 27'>27</a> ). He also called on delegates of other nations to heed his counsel and submit to Babylon (chap. <a ref='Je 27'>27</a> ), and he predicted judgments from God on various nations ( <a ref='Jeremiah 25:12–38'>25:12–38</a> ; chaps. <a ref='Je 46-51'>46–51</a> ). The dates of his ministry, which spanned 5 decades, are from the Judean king Josiah’s 13th year, noted in <a ref='Jeremiah 1:2'>1:2</a> (627 BC), to beyond the fall of Jerusalem to Babylon in 586 BC ( <a ref='Je 39-40'>Jer 39–40</a> , <a ref='Je 52'>52</a> ). After 586 BC, Jeremiah was forced to go with a fleeing remnant of Judah to Egypt ( <a ref='Je 43-44'>Jer 43–44</a> ). He was possibly still ministering in 570 BC ( <i>see note on <a ref='Jeremiah 44:29–30'>44:29–30</a></i> ). A rabbinic note claims that when Babylon invaded Egypt in 568/67 BC Jeremiah was taken captive to Babylon. He could have lived even to pen the book’s closing scene ca. 561 BC in Babylon, when Judah’s king Jehoiachin, captive in Babylon since 597 BC, was allowed liberties in his last days ( <a ref='Jeremiah 52:31–34'>52:31–34</a> ). Jeremiah, if still alive at that time, was between 85 and 90 years old. Background and Setting Background details of Jeremiah’s times are portrayed in <a ref='2Ki 22-25'>2Ki 22–25</a> and <a ref='2Ch 34-36'>2Chr 34–36</a> . Jeremiah’s messages paint pictures of: 1) his people’s sin; 2) the invader God would send; 3) the rigors of siege; and 4) calamities of destruction. Jeremiah’s message of impending judgment for idolatry and other sins was preached over a period of 40 years (ca. 627–586 BC and beyond). His prophecy took place during the reigns of Judah’s final 5 kings (Josiah 640–609 BC, Jehoahaz 609 BC, Jehoiakim 609–598 BC, Jehoiachin 598–597 BC, and Zedekiah 597–586 BC). The spiritual condition of Judah was one of flagrant idol worship (cf. chap. <a ref='Je 2'>2</a> ). King Ahaz, preceding his son Hezekiah long before Jeremiah in Isaiah’s day, had set up a system of sacrificing children to the god Molech in the Valley of Hinnom just outside Jerusalem (735–715 BC). Hezekiah led in reforms and clean-up ( <a ref='Isaiah 36:7'>Is 36:7</a> ), but his son Manasseh continued to foster child sacrifice along with gross idolatry, which continued into Jeremiah’s time ( <a ref='Jeremiah 7:31'>7:31</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 19:5'>19:5</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 32:35'>32:35</a> ). Many also worshiped the “queen of heaven” ( <a ref='Jeremiah 7:18'>7:18</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 44:19'>44:19</a> ). Josiah’s reforms, reaching their apex in 622 BC, forced a repressing of the worst practices outwardly, but the deadly cancer of sin was deep and flourished quickly again after a shallow revival. Religious insincerity, dishonesty, adultery, injustice, tyranny against the helpless, and slander prevailed as the norm not the exception. Politically momentous events occurred in Jeremiah’s day. Assyria saw its power wane gradually; then Ashurbanipal died in 626 BC. Assyria grew so feeble that in 612 BC her seemingly invincible capital, Nineveh, was destroyed (cf. the book of Nahum). The Neo-Babylonian empire under Nabopolassar (625–605 BC) became dominant militarily with victories against Assyria (612 BC), Egypt (609–605 BC), and Israel in 3 phases (605 BC, as in <a ref='Da 1'>Da 1</a> ; 597 BC, as in <a ref='2 Kings 24:10–16'>2Ki 24:10–16</a> ; and 586 BC, as in <a ref='Je 39-40'>Jer 39–40</a> , <a ref='Je 52'>52</a> ). While Joel and Micah had earlier prophesied of Judah’s judgment, during Josiah’s reign, God’s leading prophets were Jeremiah, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah. Later, Jeremiah’s contemporaries, Ezekiel and Daniel, played prominent prophetic roles. Historical and Theological Themes The main theme of Jeremiah is judgment upon Judah (chaps. <a ref='Je 1-29'>1–29</a> ) with restoration in the future messianic kingdom ( <a ref='Jeremiah 23:3–8'>23:3–8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:30–33'>30–33</a> ). Whereas Isaiah devoted many chapters to a future glory for Israel ( <a ref='Is 40-66'>Is 40–66</a> ), Jeremiah gave far less space to this subject. Since God’s judgment was imminent, he concentrated on current problems as he sought to turn the nation back from the point of no return. A secondary theme is God’s willingness to spare and bless the nation only if the people repent. Though this is a frequent emphasis, it is most graphically portrayed at the potter’s shop ( <a ref='Jeremiah 18:1–11'>18:1–11</a> ). A further focus is God’s plan for Jeremiah’s life, both in his proclamation of God’s message and in his commitment to fulfill all of His will ( <a ref='Jeremiah 1:5–19'>1:5–19</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 15:19–21'>15:19–21</a> ). Other themes include: 1) God’s longing for Israel to be tender toward Him, as in the days of first love ( <a ref='Jeremiah 2:1–3'>2:1–3</a> ); 2) Jeremiah’s servant tears, as “the weeping prophet” ( <a ref='Jeremiah 9:1'>9:1</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 14:17'>14:17</a> ); 3) the close, intimate relationship God had with Israel and that He yearned to keep ( <a ref='Jeremiah 13:11'>13:11</a> ); 4) suffering, as in Jeremiah’s trials ( <a ref='Jeremiah 11:18–23'>11:18–23</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 20:1–18'>20:1–18</a> ) and God’s sufficiency in all trouble ( <a ref='Jeremiah 20:11–13'>20:11–13</a> ); 5) the vital role that God’s Word can play in life ( <a ref='Jeremiah 15:16'>15:16</a> ); 6) the place of faith in expecting restoration from the God for whom nothing is too difficult (chap. <a ref='Je 32'>32</a> , especially vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:17'>17</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 32:27'>27</a> ); and 7) prayer for the coordination of God’s will with God’s action in restoring Israel to its land ( <a ref='Jeremiah 33:3'>33:3</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 33:6–18'>6–18</a> ). Interpretive Challenges A number of questions arise, such as: 1) How can one explain God’s forbidding prayer for the Jews ( <a ref='Jeremiah 7:16'>7:16</a> ) and saying that even Moses’ and Samuel’s advocacy could not avert judgment ( <a ref='Jeremiah 15:1'>15:1</a> )? 2) Did Jeremiah make an actual trek of several hundred miles to the Euphrates River, or did he bury his loin cloth nearby ( <a ref='Jeremiah 13:4–7'>13:4–7</a> )? 3) How could he utter such severe things about the man who announced his birth ( <a ref='Jeremiah 20:14–18'>20:14–18</a> )? 4) Does the curse on Jeconiah’s kingly line relate to Christ ( <a ref='Jeremiah 22:30'>22:30</a> )? 5) How is one to interpret the promises of Israel’s return to its ancient land (chaps. <a ref='Je 30-33'>30–33</a> )? and 6) How will God fulfill the New Covenant in relation to Israel and the church ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>31:31–34</a> )? The answers to these will be included in the study notes at the appropriate passages. A frequent challenge is to understand the prophet’s messages in their right time setting, since the book of Jeremiah is not always chronological, but loosely arranged, moving back and forth in time for thematic effect. Ezekiel, by contrast, usually places his material in chronological order. Outline I. Preparation of Jeremiah ( <a ref='Jeremiah 1:1–19'>1:1–19</a> ) A.

Paul’s similar realization, <a ref='Galatians 1:15'>Ga 1:15</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 1:6'>1:6</a> Jeremiah’s response points out his inability and his inexperience. If as a young man he was 20–25 years old in 626 BC, he was 60–65 in 586 BC when Jerusalem fell (chap. <a ref='Je 39'>39</a> ), and 85–90 if he lived to the time of <a ref='Jeremiah 52:31–34'>52:31–34</a> (ca. 561 BC). <a ref='Jeremiah 1:7–10'>1:7–10</a> The power backing Jeremiah’s service was God’s presence and provision (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 3:5'>2Co 3:5</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>My words in your mouth.</b> God used him as His mouthpiece, speaking His message ( <a ref='Jeremiah 15:19'>15:19</a> ); thus, Jeremiah’s fitting response was to receive God’s Word ( <a ref='Jeremiah 15:16'>15:16</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 1:10'>1:10</a> <b>appointed you … over.</b> Because God spoke through Jeremiah, the message has divine authority. <a ref='Jeremiah 1:11–16'>1:11–16</a> Illustrations of God’s charge were twofold.

God had divorced Israel but not yet Judah (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 50:1'>Is 50:1</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Ezra 10:3'>Ezr 10:3</a> , where divorce is the right action of God’s people to separate from idolatrous wives. <a ref='Jeremiah 3:14'>3:14</a> <b>I am a master to you.</b> God pictured His covenant relationship with Israel as a marriage, and pleaded with mercy for Judah to repent and return. He will take her back. Cf. Hosea’s restoration of Gomer as a picture of God taking back His wicked, adulterous people. <a ref='Jeremiah 3:15–18'>3:15–18</a> <b>It shall be in those days.</b> When Israel repents (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 3:13–14'>13–14</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 3:22'>22</a> ), which has not happened, but will in the millennial era of God’s restoration that the prophets often describe ( <a ref='Jeremiah 23:5–6'>Jer 23:5–6</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:30–33'>30–33</a> ; <a ref='Eze 36'>Eze 36</a> ), God will bring these blessings: 1) shepherds to teach them the truth; 2) His own immediate presence on the throne in Jerusalem, not just the ark of His covenant; 3) allegiance even of Gentile nations; 4) righteousness; 5) genuineness in worship; 6) unity of Israel (north) and Judah (south) into one kingdom; and 7) reestablishment in their own Promised Land. <a ref='Jeremiah 3:19'>3:19</a> <b>set you among My sons.</b> Here is a reference to adoption into God’s family, when the people turn back from idols to acknowledge Him as “Father.” <a ref='Jeremiah 3:20'>3:20</a> <b>a woman treacherously departs.</b> Hosea had earlier used this same imagery (ca. 755–710 BC). Thus God had given the divorce because the spiritual adultery was unrepentant. But when repentance comes, He will take Israel back (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 3:1'>3:1</a> ). <b>O … Israel.</b> Since the irretrievable dispersion of Israel in the north (722 BC) Judah alone was left to be called by the name Israel, as Jeremiah sometimes chose to do (e.g., <a ref='Jeremiah 3:20–23'>3:20–23</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 4:3'>4:3</a> <b>Break up.</b> Jeremiah appealed for a spiritual turnabout from sinful, wasteful lives. He pictured this as the plowing of ground, formerly hard and unproductive due to weeds, in order to make it useful for sowing (cf. <a ref='Matthew 13:18–23'>Mt 13:18–23</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 4:4'>4:4</a> <b>Circumcise.</b> This surgery ( <a ref='Genesis 17:10–14'>Ge 17:10–14</a> ) was to cut away flesh that could hold disease in its folds and could pass the disease on to wives. It was important for the preservation of God’s people physically. But it was also a symbol of the need for the heart to be cleansed from sin’s deadly disease. The really essential surgery needed to happen on the inside, where God calls for taking away fleshly things that keep the heart from being spiritually devoted to Him and from true faith in Him and His will. Jeremiah later expanded on this theme ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>31:31–34</a> ; cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:16'>Dt 10:16</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:6'>30:6</a> ; <a ref='Romans 2:29'>Ro 2:29</a> ). God selected the reproductive organ as the location of the symbol for man’s need of cleansing for sin, because it is the instrument most indicative of his depravity, since by it he reproduces generations of sinners. <a ref='Jeremiah 4:6–7'>4:6–7</a> <b>evil from the north.</b> This evil is Babylon’s army, which would invade from that direction. The “lion” on the prowl fit Babylon because of its conquering power, and Babylon was symbolized by the winged lions guarding its royal court. Babylon is later identified in <a ref='Jeremiah 20:4'>20:4</a> . Many details in chap. <a ref='Je 4'>4</a> graphically depict warriors in conquest (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 4:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 4:13'>13</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 4:29'>29</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 4:10'>4:10</a> <b>deceived.</b> Like Habakkuk ( <a ref='Habakkuk 1:12–17'>1:12–17</a> ), Jeremiah was horrified at these words of judgment, contrasting the prevailing hope of peace. God is sometimes described as if doing a thing He merely permits, such as allowing false prophets who delude themselves to also deceive a sinful people into thinking peace would follow (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 6:14'>6:14</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 8:11'>8:11</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 22:21–24'>1Ki 22:21–24</a> ). God sees how people insist on their delusions, and lets it happen. <a ref='Jeremiah 4:14'>4:14</a> <b>Wash.</b> Jeremiah continued to appeal for a dealing with sin so that national destruction might be averted (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 4:20'>20</a> ), while there was still time to repent (cf. chaps. <a ref='Je 7'>7</a> , <a ref='Je 26'>26</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 4:22'>4:22</a> <b>wise to do evil.</b> Israelites were wise or clever in doing evil but were dull in knowing to do the good, i.e., God’s will. Paul, applying the principle but turning it to the positive, wanted the believers at Rome to be wise to do good but unlearned in the skill of doing evil ( <a ref='Romans 16:19'>Ro 16:19</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 4:23'>4:23</a> <b>formless.</b> Jeremiah may be borrowing the language, but the description in its context is not of creation in <a ref='Genesis 1:2'>Ge 1:2</a> , but of judgment on the land of Israel and its cities (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 4:20'>20</a> ). The invader left it desolate of the previous form and void of inhabitants due to slaying and flight (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 4:25'>25</a> ). The heavens gave no light, possibly due to smoke from fires that were destroying cities (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 4:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 4:20'>20</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 5:1'>5:1</a> <b>find a man.</b> The city was too sinful to have even one man who, by truth and justice, could qualify to be an advocate to secure pardon for Judah. Refusal to repent was the norm (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 5:3'>3</a> ) for the common people (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 5:4'>4</a> ) and for the leaders (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 5:5'>5</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 5:6'>5:6</a> <b>lion.</b> Three animals which tear and eat their victims represented the invader: the lion ( <i>see note on <a ref='Jeremiah 4:6–7'>4:6–7</a></i> ), the wolf, and the leopard, picturing vicious judgment on both poor (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 5:4'>4</a> ) and great (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 5:5'>5</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 5:7'>5:7</a> <b>adultery.</b> Often the idea of adultery is figurative for idolatry or political alliances ( <i>see note on <a ref='Jeremiah 3:1'>3:1</a></i> ), but the language here refers to physical adultery by men seeking out a prostitute or going to neighbors’ wives (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 5:8'>8</a> ), thus violating the seventh commandment ( <a ref='Exodus 20:14'>Ex 20:14</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 5:10'>5:10</a> <b>not Yahweh’s.</b> The people, depicted as vine branches to be destroyed (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 11:16–17'>11:16–17</a> ), did not genuinely know Yahweh in a saving relationship, but had forsaken Him and given allegiance to other gods. The description of having eyes but not seeing, and ears but not hearing (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 5:21'>21</a> ) is used by Isaiah ( <a ref='Isaiah 6:9'>6:9</a> ) and Jesus Christ ( <a ref='Matthew 13:13'>Mt 13:13</a> ) for such false professors as these branches. Jesus also referred to false branches in <a ref='John 15:2'>Jn 15:2</a> , <a ref='John 15:6'>6</a> which were burned. <a ref='Jeremiah 5:14'>5:14</a> <b>My words … fire.</b> The judgment of Judah prophesied in God’s Word by Jeremiah will bring destruction, but not elimination (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 5:18'>18</a> ), to the nation, cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 23:29'>23:29</a> . <a ref='Jeremiah 5:22'>5:22</a> <b>sand … for the sea.</b> God’s providential acts in the natural world such as 1) creating the seashore to prevent flooding, 2) giving rain at the appropriate times (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 5:24'>24</a> ), and 3) providing time for harvest (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 5:24'>24</a> ) are witness enough to Yahweh’s reality and grace. As the nation turns away from God, He will take these unappreciated gifts away (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 5:25'>25</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 5:31'>5:31</a> <b>prophesy with lying.</b> These included prophets with bogus messages, priests who asserted their own authority, and also followers who indulged such falseness.

The need was to return to obedience (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 6:16'>16</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 8:11'>8:11</a> . <a ref='Jeremiah 6:16'>6:16</a> Here is the image of travelers who are lost, stopping to inquire about the right way they once knew before they wandered so far off it. <a ref='Jeremiah 6:17'>6:17</a> <b>watchmen.</b> Prophets. <a ref='Jeremiah 6:20'>6:20</a> <b>not acceptable.</b> Using imported fragrances in their offerings did not make them sweetly acceptable to God when the worshipers rejected His Word (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 6:19'>19</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 6:21'>6:21</a> <b>stumbling blocks.</b> Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 8:14'>Is 8:14</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 21:44'>Mt 21:44</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:8'>1Pe 2:8</a> . <a ref='Jeremiah 6:22–23'>6:22–23</a> A description of the Babylonians. <a ref='Jeremiah 6:27–30'>6:27–30</a> <b>I have made you.</b> God placed Jeremiah as a kind of assayer to test the people’s obedience.

The point of this message, however, was that if Israel would repent, even at this late hour, God would still keep the conqueror from coming (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 7:3'>3</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 7:7'>7</a> ). They must reject lies such as the false hope that peace is certain, based on the reasoning that Yahweh would never bring calamity on His own temple (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 7:4'>4</a> ). They must turn from their sins (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 7:3'>3</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 7:5'>5</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 7:9'>9</a> ), and end their hypocrisy (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 7:10'>10</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 7:7'>7:7</a> <b>the land that I gave … forever.</b> God refers to the unconditional element of the land promise in the Abrahamic Covenant ( <a ref='Ge 12'>Ge 12</a> , <a ref='Ge 15'>15</a> , <a ref='Ge 17'>17</a> , <a ref='Ge 22'>22</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 7:12'>7:12</a> <b>go … to … Shiloh.</b> God calls them to return to Shiloh where the tabernacle dwelt along with the ark of the covenant.

Chief among things provoking judgment was the intense sin of King Manasseh (695–642 BC).

Ultimately, a band of renegade Judeans took Jeremiah to Egypt against God’s will (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 43:1–7'>43:1–7</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 15:15–18'>15:15–18</a> <b>You who know, O Yahweh.</b> Jeremiah, in a mood of self-pity, reminded Yahweh of his faithfulness in bearing reproach, his love for His Word, and his separation from evil men to stand alone. <a ref='Jeremiah 15:18'>15:18</a> <b>a deceptive</b> stream <b>.</b> He asked that Yahweh not fail him like a wadi that has dried up (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 15:18'>18</a> ).

If he did so, he would discern true values (“extract the precious,” a figure drawn from removing pure metal from dross), and have the further privilege of being God’s mouthpiece. Let sinners change to his values, but let him never compromise to theirs. As a man who is to assay and test others ( <a ref='Jeremiah 6:27–30'>6:27–30</a> ), he must first assay himself (cf.

After the return from Babylon, this was partly fulfilled as the Jews entirely and permanently renounced idols, and many Gentiles turned from their idols to Jehovah. However, the complete fulfillment will come in the final restoration of Israel (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 2:1–4'>Is 2:1–4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 49:6'>49:6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:3'>60:3</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 17:1'>17:1</a> <b>The sin of Judah.</b> Reasons for the judgment (chap. <a ref='Je 16'>16</a> ) continue here: 1) idolatry (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:1–4'>1–4</a> ), 2) relying on the flesh (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:5'>5</a> ), and 3) dishonesty in amassing wealth (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:11'>11</a> ). <b>iron stylus.</b> The names of idols were engraved on the horns of their altars with such a tool.

How much different to have God’s word written on the heart ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:33'>31:33</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 17:3'>17:3</a> <b>mountain of Mine in the countryside.</b> Jerusalem in Judah. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:4'>17:4</a> <b>land … you do not know.</b> Babylon. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:5–8'>17:5–8</a> <b>Cursed is the man.</b> Jeremiah contrasted the person who experiences barrenness (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:5–6'>5–6</a> ) with the one who receives blessing (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:7–8'>7–8</a> ). The difference in attitude is in “trust” placed in man or “trust” vested in Yahweh (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:5'>5</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 17:7'>7</a> ). And the contrast in vitality is between being like a parched dwarf juniper in the desert (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:6'>6</a> ) or a tree drawing sustenance from a stream to bear fruit (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:8'>8</a> ; cf. <a ref='Psalms 1:1–3'>Ps 1:1–3</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 17:10'>17:10</a> <b>I … search the heart.</b> For the sin of man (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:1–4'>1–4</a> ), for the barren man (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:5–6'>5–6</a> ), or the blessed man (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:7–8'>7–8</a> ), God is the final Judge and renders His judgment for their works (cf. <a ref='Revelation 20:11–15'>Rev 20:11–15</a> ). By Him, actions are weighed ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:3'>1Sa 2:3</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 17:11'>17:11</a> <b>a partridge.</b> This referred to a sand grouse which invaded and brooded over a nest not its own, but was forced to leave before the eggs hatched. It depicted a person who unjustly took possession of things he had no right to take and couldn’t enjoy the benefits, despite all the effort. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:14–18'>17:14–18</a> Jeremiah voiced the prayerful cry that God would deliver him from his enemies (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:14'>14</a> ). Surrounded by ungodly people (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:1–6'>1–6</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 17:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 17:13'>13</a> ), he showed qualities of godliness: 1) God was his praise (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:14'>14</a> ); 2) he had a shepherd’s heart to follow God (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:16'>16</a> ); 3) he was a man of prayer open to God’s examination (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:16'>16</a> ); 4) God was his hope (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:17'>17</a> ); and 5) he trusted God’s delivering faithfulness even in judgment (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:18'>18</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 17:21–24'>17:21–24</a> <b>sabbath day.</b> Not only had the Jews failed to observe Sabbath days, but also the required Sabbath year of rest for the land ( <a ref='Leviticus 25:1–7'>Lv 25:1–7</a> ) was regularly violated. God had warned that such disobedience would bring judgment ( <a ref='Leviticus 26:34–35'>Lv 26:34–35</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 26:43'>43</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:20–21'>2Chr 36:20–21</a> ). The 70-year captivity was correlated to the 490 years from Saul to the captivity, which included 70 Sabbath years. When the Jews were restored from captivity, special stress was placed on Sabbath faithfulness (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 13:19'>Ne 13:19</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 17:25–27'>17:25–27</a> For obedience, God would assure the dynasty of David perpetual rule in Jerusalem, safety for the city, and worship at the temple (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:25–26'>25–26</a> ). Continued disobedience would meet with destruction of the city (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:27'>27</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 18:1–20:18'>18:1—20:18</a> A close link exists between chap. <a ref='Je 17'>17</a> and chaps. <a ref='Je 18-20'>18–20</a> . Destruction is in view (chap. <a ref='Je 17'>17</a> ), but repentance can yet prevent that ( <a ref='Jeremiah 18:7–8'>18:7–8</a> ). However, repentance was not present ( <a ref='Jeremiah 18:12'>18:12</a> ), so Jeremiah’s shattered jar illustrated God’s dashing Israel in judgment (chap. <a ref='Je 19'>19</a> ). Then the rejection spirit (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 19:15'>19:15</a> ) led to persecution against God’s mouthpiece (chap. <a ref='Je 20'>20</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 18:2–6'>18:2–6</a> <b>potter’s house.</b> God sent Jeremiah to a potter, who gave him an illustration by shaping a vessel. The prophet secured a vessel and used it for his own illustration ( <a ref='Jeremiah 19:1'>19:1ff.</a> ). Jeremiah watched the potter at his wheel. The soft clay became misshapen, but the potter shaped it back into a good vessel. God will so do with Judah if she repents. <a ref='Jeremiah 18:8–10'>18:8–10</a> Though He had announced impending judgment, the “spoiled” nation can be restored as a good vessel by God, who will hold off the judgment (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 18:8'>8</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 18:11'>11</a> ). By contrast, if the nation followed sin, He would not bring the blessing desired (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 18:9–10'>9–10</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 18:12'>18:12</a> <b>It’s hopeless!</b> Jeremiah brought them to the point where they actually stated their condition honestly. The prophet’s threats were useless because they were so far gone—abandoned to their sins and the penalty. All hypocrisy was abandoned in favor of honesty, without repentance. Repentance was not in Israel (as v. <a ref='Jeremiah 18:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 19:15'>19:15</a> ). This explains a seeming paradox: that Israel can repent and avert judgment, yet Jeremiah is not to pray for Israel ( <a ref='Jeremiah 7:16'>7:16</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 11:14'>11:14</a> ). It would do no good to pray for their change since they steeled themselves against any change. <a ref='Jeremiah 18:13'>18:13</a> <b>virgin of Israel.</b> It enhanced their guilt that Israel was the virgin whom God had chosen (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 19:21'>2Ki 19:21</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 18:14'>18:14</a> <b>snow of Lebanon … cold flowing water.</b> No reasonable man would forsake such for “the rock of the open country,” perhaps a poetic term for Mt. Lebanon, from which the high mountain streams flowed. Yet Israel forsook God, the fountain of living waters, for broken foreign cisterns (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 2:13'>2:13</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 18:18'>18:18</a> <b>plans against Jeremiah.</b> Plans to indict the prophet with their “tongues” and then to slay him (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 18:23'>23</a> ) were based on the premise that his message of doom was not true. The business of the priests, the wise, and the prophets continued as usual since God made them lasting institutions (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 6:18'>Lv 6:18</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 10:11'>10:11</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 18:19–23'>18:19–23</a> <b>give heed to me.</b> This is one of many examples of prayer aligning with God’s will as Jeremiah prays for God’s work of judgment to be done (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 18:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 18:15–17'>15–17</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 18:22'>18:22</a> <b>dug a pit.</b> Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 38:6'>38:6</a> . <a ref='Jeremiah 19:1'>19:1</a> <b>elders of the people … elders of the priests.</b> These were chosen to be credible witnesses of the symbolic action with the “earthenware jar,” so no one could plead ignorance of the prophesy.

Rubbish from Jerusalem was dumped there and continually burned. The place became a symbol for the burning fires of hell, called Gehenna ( <a ref='Matthew 5:22'>Mt 5:22</a> ).

The curse continued in his descendants down to Joseph, the husband of Mary. How could Jesus then be the Messiah when His father was under this curse? It was because Joseph was not involved in the blood line of Jesus since He was virgin born ( <a ref='Matthew 1:12'>Mt 1:12</a> ). Jesus’ blood right to the throne of David came through Mary from Nathan, Solomon’s brother, not Solomon (Jeconiah’s line), thus bypassing this curse ( <a ref='Luke 3:31–32'>Lk 3:31–32</a> ).

Cf. <a ref='Psalms 102:13–17'>Ps 102:13–17</a> for the relation of Israel’s restoration to their prayers; see also <a ref='Jeremiah 24:6–7'>24:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 5:21'>Lam 5:21</a> ; cf. <a ref='John 6:44'>Jn 6:44</a> , <a ref='John 6:65'>65</a> . <a ref='Jeremiah 31:22'>31:22</a> <b>faithless.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Jeremiah 2:19'>2:19</a> .</i> <b>A woman will encompass a man.</b> Here is one of the most puzzling statements in Jeremiah. Some see the virgin birth of Christ (but “woman” means a woman, not a virgin, and “encompass” or “surround” does not suggest conceiving). Possibly it refers to the formerly virgin Israel (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 31:21'>21</a> ), who is now a disgraced, divorced wife (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 31:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 3:8'>3:8</a> ). She will one day in the future re-embrace her former husband, Yahweh, and He will receive her back, fully forgiven. That would be “a new thing in the earth.” <a ref='Jeremiah 31:26'>31:26</a> <b>my sleep was pleasant.</b> The hope of Israel’s restoration brought a moment of peace in Jeremiah’s otherwise tumultuous ministry. <a ref='Jeremiah 31:28'>31:28</a> <b>build and … plant.</b> Yahweh repeated what He at first told Jeremiah in <a ref='Jeremiah 1:10'>1:10</a> regarding His two works of judging and blessing. The latter is in two images, architectural (building) and agricultural (planting). <a ref='Jeremiah 31:29'>31:29</a> <b>eaten sour grapes.</b> This was apparently a proverb among the exiles’ children born in Babylon, to express that they suffered the consequences of their fathers’ sins rather than their own ( <a ref='Lamentations 5:7'>Lam 5:7</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 18:2–3'>Eze 18:2–3</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>31:31–34</a> <b>a new covenant.</b> In contrast to the Mosaic Covenant under which Israel failed, God promised a New Covenant with a spiritual, divine dynamic by which those who know Him would participate in the blessings of salvation. The fulfillment was to individuals, yet also to Israel as a nation (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 31:36'>36</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:16–27'>Ro 11:16–27</a> ). It is set 1) in the framework of a reestablishment in their land (e.g., chaps. <a ref='Je 30-33'>30–33</a> and in vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 31:38–40'>38–40</a> ) and 2) in the time after the ultimate difficulty ( <a ref='Jeremiah 30:7'>30:7</a> ). In principle, this covenant, also announced by Jesus Christ ( <a ref='Luke 22:20'>Lk 22:20</a> ), begins to be exercised with spiritual aspects realized for Jewish and Gentile believers in the church era ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 11:25'>1Co 11:25</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 8:7–13'>Heb 8:7–13</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:15'>9:15</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:14–17'>10:14–17</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 12:24'>12:24</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 13:20'>13:20</a> ). It has already begun to take effect with “a remnant according to <i>God’s</i> gracious choice” ( <a ref='Romans 11:5'>Ro 11:5</a> ). It will be also realized by the people of Israel in the last days, including the regathering to their ancient land (chaps. <a ref='Je 30-33'>30–33</a> ). The streams of the Abrahamic, Davidic, and New Covenants find their confluence in the millennial kingdom ruled over by the Messiah. <a ref='Jeremiah 31:35–37'>31:35–37</a> These verses emphasize the certainty with which Israel can expect God to fulfill the New Covenant (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 33:17–22'>33:17–22</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 33:25–26'>25–26</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 31:38–40'>31:38–40</a> The tower was in the northeast corner of the city (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 3:1'>Ne 3:1</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 12:39'>12:39</a> ). When New Covenant promises are ultimately fulfilled to Israel in its regathering to its land, rebuilt Jerusalem will meet certain specifications. The “Corner Gate” is at the northwest corner ( <a ref='2 Kings 14:13'>2Ki 14:13</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 26:9'>2Chr 26:9</a> ). The “measuring line” marks out the area for rebuilding. It will point over the hill Gareb and then toward Goah; both places are impossible to identify today. The “valley of … dead bodies” is the valley of Hinnom, a place of refuse and burning fires (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 7:31'>7:31</a> , and <i>see note there</i> ). The “Horse Gate” was at the southeast corner of the temple courts ( <a ref='2 Kings 11:16'>2Ki 11:16</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 3:28'>Ne 3:28</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 32:1'>32:1</a> <b>tenth year.</b> The time is 587 BC, the tenth year in Zedekiah’s reign (597–586 BC), the eighteenth of Nebuchadnezzar’s rule, during Babylon’s siege of Jerusalem. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:2'>32:2</a> <b>military force of … Babylon was besieging.</b> The siege, set up in the tenth month (Jan.) of 588 BC, lasted at least 30 months to the fourth month (July) of 586 BC ( <a ref='Jeremiah 39:1–2'>39:1–2</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 34:1'>34:1</a> and <i>see note there</i> . The events of the chapter occurred in this setting of Judah’s imminent loss of its land, only about a year before Babylon’s final takeover detailed in chaps. <a ref='Je 39-40'>39–40</a> , <a ref='Je 52'>52</a> . <a ref='Jeremiah 32:2–5'>32:2–5</a> <b>shut up in the court of the guard.</b> Judah’s final king put Jeremiah into prison on the charge of preaching treason, against nation and king, whereas Zedekiah savored positive talk to spark new morale to hold out. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:8'>32:8</a> <b>the</b> legal <b>judgment for … redemption.</b> A man facing hardship could sell property, and the right to redeem it until the Jubilee year belonged to the closest blood relative. If a stranger had taken it due to unpaid debt, the relative could redeem it as a family possession ( <a ref='Leviticus 25:25'>Lv 25:25</a> ). Levite land could be sold only to a Levite ( <a ref='Leviticus 25:32–34'>Lv 25:32–34</a> ), such as Jeremiah. He did as Yahweh told him (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:9–12'>9–12</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 32:14'>32:14</a> <b>Take these deeds.</b> Title deeds to the land, kept for security reasons in a pottery jar, would attest in a future day to one’s claim of possession. Men of Anathoth did return to Jerusalem from Babylon ( <a ref='Ezra 2:23'>Ezr 2:23</a> ). Also, some of the poor of the land, left by the Babylonians (chap. <a ref='Je 39'>39</a> ), could have included certain inhabitants of Anathoth. In a still future day, God will be able (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:17'>17</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 32:27'>27</a> ) to make this land good to a resurrected Jeremiah and confirm to the right people that they are the prophet/priest’s descendants. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:16–25'>32:16–25</a> With the immense sovereign power God possesses to do whatever He wishes in the present captivity and the future return, Jeremiah wondered why God had him redeem the field. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:26–35'>32:26–35</a> God reviewed Judah’s sins and affirmed to Jeremiah that the Babylonians would prevail over Jerusalem (“this city” in v. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:28'>28</a> , etc.). <a ref='Jeremiah 32:36–41'>32:36–41</a> However, one day God will restore Israel to the land and provide the blessing of salvation. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:37'>32:37</a> <b>I will cause them to return to this place.</b> God pledged to restore Israelites to the very land of Israel (cf. v. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:44'>44</a> ). It is natural to expect His fulfillment of this blessing to be just as literal as the reverse—His scattering from the land (cf. v. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:42'>42</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 32:38–39'>32:38–39</a> This speaks of spiritual salvation, i.e., the true knowledge and worship of God. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:40'>32:40</a> <b>an everlasting covenant.</b> The ultimate fulfillment of a future in the land was not fulfilled in the Ezra/Nehemiah return. This occurs in the time when God gives the people of Israel a new heart in eternal salvation along with their return to the ancient land (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 33:8–9'>33:8–9</a> and <a ref='Ezekiel 36:26'>Eze 36:26</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 32:42–44'>32:42–44</a> In the millennial kingdom, land will again be bought and sold in Israel. <a ref='Jeremiah 33:3'>33:3</a> <b>Call. … will answer.</b> God invited Jeremiah’s prayer, which appeals to Him to fulfill the aspects of His promises which He guarantees He will attend to (as <a ref='Jeremiah 29:11–14'>29:11–14</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:4–19'>Da 9:4–19</a> ; cf. <a ref='John 15:7'>Jn 15:7</a> ). His answer to the prayer was assured in vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 33:4–26'>4–26</a> here (cf. v. <a ref='Jeremiah 33:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 33:8'>33:8</a> Again Yahweh emphasized the individual spiritual salvation associated with the New Covenant restoration to the land. <a ref='Jeremiah 33:11'>33:11</a> <b>Give thanks to Yahweh.</b> These are the words of <a ref='Psalms 136:1'>Ps 136:1</a> , actually used by the Jews at their return from Babylon ( <a ref='Ezra 3:11'>Ezr 3:11</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 33:15'>33:15</a> <b>a righteous Branch.</b> This is the Messiah King in David’s lineage, as in <a ref='Jeremiah 23:5–6'>23:5–6</a> .

The promise was as certain as the sure appearance of night and day and the incalculable number of stars or sand grains (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 31:35–37'>31:35–37</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 33:25–26'>33:25–26</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 33:24'>33:24</a> <b>two families.</b> Judah and Israel. <b>He has rejected them.</b> Many, even today, believe Israel as a nation has no future. In vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 33:25–26'>25–26</a> God emphatically denies that notion (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 31:35–36'>31:35–36</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 74:16–17'>Ps 74:16–17</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:1–2'>Ro 11:1–2</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 34:1'>34:1</a> <b>Nebuchadnezzar … fighting.</b> The siege began ca.

This chapter was set in Zedekiah’s reign, during the siege of 588–586 BC, and was an amplification of <a ref='Jeremiah 32:1–5'>32:1–5</a> , the message that resulted in Jeremiah’s incarceration. <b>against Jerusalem.</b> Babylon’s destruction of Jerusalem began Aug. 14, 586 ( <a ref='2 Kings 25:8–9'>2Ki 25:8–9</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 34:3'>34:3</a> This prophecy about Zedekiah (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:1–5'>32:1–5</a> ) was fulfilled as reported in <a ref='2 Kings 25:6–7'>2Ki 25:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 52:7–11'>Jer 52:7–11</a> . <a ref='Jeremiah 34:8–10'>34:8–10</a> <b>a covenant … to proclaim release.</b> Zedekiah’s pact to free slaves or servants met with initial compliance.

Some suggest that this treachery came when the Egyptian army approached and Babylon’s forces withdrew temporarily ( <a ref='Jeremiah 37:5'>37:5</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 37:11'>11</a> ) and the inhabitants believed that danger was past. <a ref='Jeremiah 34:12–16'>34:12–16</a> <b>Then the word … came.</b> God reminded the unfaithful Jews of His own covenant, when He freed Israelites from Egyptian bondage (cf. <a ref='Exodus 21:2'>Ex 21:2</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 15:12–15'>Dt 15:12–15</a> ). He had commanded that Hebrew slaves should serve only 6 years, then be set free in the seventh (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 34:13–14'>13–14</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 34:17–22'>34:17–22</a> <b>You have not obeyed.</b> Due to recent duplicity (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 34:16'>16</a> ), God promised only one kind of liberty to the offenders, liberty to judgment by sword, pestilence, and famine (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 34:17'>17</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 34:18'>34:18</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 34:21'>21</a> <b>cut the calf in two.</b> God will give the guilty over to death before the conqueror, for they denied the covenant ratified by blood (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 34:21'>21</a> ).

By that symbolic action, each pledged to fulfill his promise, agreeing in effect, “May my life (represented by the blood) be poured out if I fail to honor my part.” <a ref='Jeremiah 35:1–19'>35:1–19</a> This chapter provided a description of the commitment to obedience by a group of people to their father, in contrast to the Jews’ disobedience to God. <a ref='Jeremiah 35:1'>35:1</a> <b>days of Jehoiakim.</b> 609–597 BC. This backed up to several years before <a ref='Jeremiah 34:1'>34:1</a> , possibly for a thematic reason—to cite a case of obedience after the episode of treachery in chap. <a ref='Je 34'>34</a> . <a ref='Jeremiah 35:2'>35:2</a> <b>The Rechabites.</b> These were a seminomadic Kenite group, related to Moses’ father-in-law ( <a ref='Judges 1:16'>Jdg 1:16</a> ; <a ref='Judges 4:11'>4:11</a> ), descended from those in <a ref='1 Chronicles 2:55'>1Chr 2:55</a> . The originator of their rules was Jonadab ( <a ref='Jeremiah 35:6'>35:6</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 35:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 10:15'>2Ki 10:15</a> , <a ref='2 Kings 10:23'>23</a> ). They derived their name from Rechab (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 35:8'>8</a> ) and were not of Jacob’s seed, but “strangers” in Israel. <a ref='Jeremiah 35:8'>35:8</a> <b>listened to.</b> What was commended here was not the father’s specific commands about nomadic life, but the steadfast obedience of the sons. Their obedience was unreserved in all aspects, at all times, on the part of all, without exception; in all these respects Israel was lacking (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 35:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 35:13–17'>35:13–17</a> The prophet indicted the Jews for flagrant disobedience. <a ref='Jeremiah 35:18–19'>35:18–19</a> <b>Because you have listened to.</b> God will bless the Rechabites not in spiritually saving them all, but in preserving a posterity in which some can have a place in His service. A Rechabite still has a role in <a ref='Nehemiah 3:14'>Ne 3:14</a> . Also, the title over <a ref='Ps 71'>Ps 71</a> in the LXX (Greek translation of the OT) was addressed for use by the sons of Jonadab and the earliest captives. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:1'>36:1</a> <b>fourth year of Jehoiakim.</b> This chapter, like chap. <a ref='Je 35'>35</a> , goes back several years earlier than chaps. <a ref='Je 32-34'>32–34</a> , before or shortly after the first of 3 deportations from Jerusalem to Babylon in 605 BC. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:2'>36:2</a> <b>write on it.</b> The command was to record in one volume all the messages since the outset of Jeremiah’s ministry in 627 BC ( <a ref='Jeremiah 1:2'>1:2</a> ) up to 605/604 BC, to be read to the people in the temple (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:6'>6</a> .). <a ref='Jeremiah 36:4'>36:4</a> <b>Baruch wrote.</b> Jeremiah’s recording secretary (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:12'>32:12</a> ) wrote the prophet’s messages (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 45:1'>45:1</a> ), and penned them a second time after the first scroll was burned (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:32'>36:32</a> ). He also read the messages in the temple (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:10'>10</a> ) and in the palace (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:15'>15</a> ). Later, Jehudi read a small part of the first scroll before King Jehoiakim (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:21–23'>21–23</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 36:5'>36:5</a> <b>confined.</b> The word means “restricted, hindered, shut up,” and is the same term used for imprisonment in <a ref='Jeremiah 33:1'>33:1</a> and <a ref='Jeremiah 39:15'>39:15</a> . The fact that princes allowed Jeremiah to depart into hiding (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:19'>19</a> ) may indicate that he was curtailed in some ways without being in prison. There is no record of his being imprisoned in Jehoiakim’s rule. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:6'>36:6</a> <b>a fast day.</b> Cf. v. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:9'>9</a> .

The latter was true. They were concerned it might be God’s Word (cf. vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:16'>16</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 36:25'>25</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 36:23'>36:23</a> <b>cut it.</b> As often as Jehudi read “three or four columns,” the king cut it up, doing so all the way through the whole scroll because he rejected the message (cf. v. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:29'>29</a> ). Jehoiakim is the king who sent men to Egypt (chap. <a ref='Je 26'>26</a> ) to bring back God’s faithful prophet, Uriah, so that he could execute him. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:24'>36:24</a> <b>not in dread.</b> The king’s servants were more hardened than the princes (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:16'>16</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 36:26'>36:26</a> <b>Yahweh hid them.</b> God, who guides (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 1:8'>1:8</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 1:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 10:23'>10:23</a> ), gave Jeremiah and Baruch safety (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:19'>36:19</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 32:8'>Ps 32:8</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 3:5–6'>Pr 3:5–6</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 36:27'>36:27</a> Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 40:18'>Is 40:18</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 55:11'>55:11</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 5:18'>Mt 5:18</a> . <a ref='Jeremiah 36:31'>36:31</a> <b>I will also punish him.</b> Consequences followed Jehoiakim’s defiance.

He had none to occupy the throne (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 36:30'>30</a> ). Jehoiachin or Jeconiah (Coniah in <a ref='Jeremiah 22:24'>22:24</a> ), his son, did succeed him, but with virtually no rule at all, lasting only 3 months and 10 days in 597 BC ( <a ref='Jeremiah 22:24–30'>22:24–30</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:9–10'>2Chr 36:9–10</a> ). Babylon deported him for the rest of his life (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 52:31–34'>52:31–34</a> ), and none of his descendants ruled (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 22:30'>22:30</a> , and <i>see note there</i> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 37:1'>37:1</a> <b>Zedekiah … reigned.</b> Zedekiah, an uncle of Jeconiah, was raised to the throne by Nebuchadnezzar in contempt for Jehoiakim and Jeconiah. His 11-year vassal rule was from 597–586 BC. The message of the king to Jeremiah in this chapter is somewhat earlier than that in chap. <a ref='Je 21'>21</a> , when Zedekiah was afraid of the Chaldean’s (Babylonian’s) defeating Egypt and returning to besiege Jerusalem (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 37:3'>3</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 37:5'>5</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 37:4'>37:4</a> The prophet was no longer in the prison court as he had been ( <a ref='Jeremiah 32:2'>32:2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 33:1'>33:1</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 37:7–10'>37:7–10</a> <b>say to the king.</b> Babylon, which temporarily ended the siege to deal with an Egyptian advance, would return and destroy Jerusalem. <a ref='Jeremiah 37:12'>37:12</a> <b>Jeremiah went out.</b> He returned to his hometown to claim the property he had purchased in <a ref='Jeremiah 32:6–12'>32:6–12</a> . <a ref='Jeremiah 37:13'>37:13</a> <b>Hananiah.</b> Jeremiah had predicted his death ( <a ref='Jeremiah 28:16'>28:16</a> ), and thus the grandson took revenge with a false accusation (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 38:19'>38:19</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 52:15'>52:15</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 37:15'>37:15</a> <b>struck him.</b> Jeremiah often absorbed blows, threats, or other mistreatment for proclaiming the truth from God ( <a ref='Jeremiah 11:21'>11:21</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 20:2'>20:2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 26:8'>26:8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 36:26'>36:26</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 38:6'>38:6</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 38:25'>25</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 37:17'>37:17</a> This showed Zedekiah’s willful rejection.

Having spent 13 years in a siege of Tyre, Nebuchadnezzar was promised Egypt as a reward for humbling Tyre (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 29:17–20'>Eze 29:17–20</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 46:18'>46:18</a> <b>Tabor … Carmel.</b> As those two mountains rise above the hills of Israel, so Nebuchadnezzar will be superior. <a ref='Jeremiah 46:20–21'>46:20–21</a> <b>a pretty heifer … fattened calves.</b> Fat and untamed, ready to kill. <a ref='Jeremiah 46:26'>46:26</a> <b>Afterwards.</b> Forty years after Nebuchadnezzar’s conquest of Egypt, it threw off the Babylonian yoke but never regained its former glory ( <a ref='Ezekiel 29:11–15'>Eze 29:11–15</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 46:27–28'>46:27–28</a> <b>Jacob … do not fear.</b> Though Israel has been scattered to the nations, the nations will receive their judgments, and Yahweh will restore Israel (repeated from <a ref='Jeremiah 30:10–11'>30:10–11</a> ) from dispersion to its own land (as in <a ref='Jeremiah 23:5–8'>Jer 23:5–8</a> ; <a ref='Je 30-33'>30–33</a> ). No matter what judgments fall on Israel, they will not be destroyed, as Paul reiterates in <a ref='Romans 11:1–2'>Ro 11:1–2</a> , <a ref='Romans 11:15'>15</a> , <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>25–27</a> . <a ref='Jeremiah 47:1–5'>47:1–5</a> <b>concerning the Philistines.</b> Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 14:29–32'>Is 14:29–32</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 25:15–17'>Eze 25:15–17</a> ; <a ref='Amos 1:6–8'>Am 1:6–8</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 2:4–7'>Zep 2:4–7</a> . Although Egypt’s Pharaoh Hophra conquered the Philistines (who lived on the coastal plain of Philistia) in Gaza and Phoenicia around 587 BC (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 47:1'>1</a> ), Babylon appears to be the conqueror in this scene (“from the north”), at the same time as the invasion of Judah (588–586 BC; cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 39:1–2'>39:1–2</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 47:6–7'>47:6–7</a> <b>sword of Yahweh.</b> Cf. <a ref='Judges 7:18'>Jdg 7:18</a> , <a ref='Judges 7:20'>20</a> . <a ref='Jeremiah 48:1'>48:1</a> <b>Concerning Moab.</b> Various sites of unknown location in Moab are to be destroyed (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 48:1–5'>1–5</a> ).

Desolation overtook different parts of Moab at various times, but Babylon in 588–586 BC or 582–581 BC is likely the main destroyer (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 48:40'>48:40</a> ). The Moabites were Lot’s descendants (cf. <a ref='Genesis 19:37'>Ge 19:37</a> ), who lived east of the Dead Sea and often fought with Israel. <a ref='Jeremiah 48:7'>48:7</a> <b>Chemosh.</b> He was the leading god of Moab (cf. <a ref='Numbers 21:29'>Nu 21:29</a> ; <a ref='Judges 11:24'>Jdg 11:24</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 11:7'>1Ki 11:7</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 23:13'>2Ki 23:13</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 48:10'>48:10</a> <b>Cursed be the one.</b> God’s aim to judge Moab was so intense that He pronounced a curse on whatever instrument (army) He would use should they carry it out “with a slack <i>hand</i> ,” i.e., “carelessly,” or “negligently.” <a ref='Jeremiah 48:11–12'>48:11–12</a> This winemaking imagery is vivid. In the production of sweet wine, the juice was left in a wineskin until the sediment or dregs settled onto the bottom. Then it was poured into another skin until more dregs were separated. This process continued until the dregs were all removed and a pure, sweet wine obtained. Moab was not taken from suffering to suffering so that her bitter dregs would be removed through the purging of pain. Thus the nation was settled into the thickness and bitterness of its own sin.

This prophecy is closely related to Obadiah. These people descended from Esau (cf. <a ref='Genesis 36:1–19'>Ge 36:1–19</a> ) and lived south of the Dead Sea. Perpetual desolation is ahead for Edom (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 49:13'>13</a> ). God will make it bare (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 49:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 49:18'>18</a> ). The destroyer is probably Babylon in 588–586 BC or 582–581 BC as v. <a ref='Jeremiah 49:19'>19</a> has descriptions used of Babylon against Judah (lion, <a ref='Jeremiah 4:7'>4:7</a> ; flooding of the Jordan, <a ref='Jeremiah 12:5'>12:5</a> ). Also “swoop like an eagle” (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 49:22'>22</a> ) is used of Babylon ( <a ref='Habakkuk 1:8'>Hab 1:8</a> ). There is no prophecy of a future restoration. <a ref='Jeremiah 49:8'>49:8</a> <b>Esau.</b> He was cursed for his godlessness, and his punishment was perpetuated in his descendants (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 12:11'>Heb 12:11</a> , <a ref='Hebrews 12:17'>17</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 49:9'>49:9</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Obadiah 1:5–6'>Ob 5–6</a> .</i> <a ref='Jeremiah 49:10'>49:10</a> <b>he is no more.</b> Edom was politically extinct after the Roman conquest. <a ref='Jeremiah 49:11'>49:11</a> This was because no adult men will be left to care for them. <a ref='Jeremiah 49:12'>49:12</a> <b>those … not</b> under <b>judgment to drink … will … drink</b> it <b>.</b> This refers to the Jews who had a covenant relation to God. What will happen to a nation that has no such pledge? <a ref='Jeremiah 49:16–17'>49:16–17</a> Edom was situated in high and rugged mountains and thus convinced it was invincible. But the ruin will come and be irreversible. <a ref='Jeremiah 49:19–21'>49:19–21</a> These words are repeated in <a ref='Jeremiah 50:44–46'>50:44–46</a> , where they refer to Babylon. <a ref='Jeremiah 49:20'>49:20</a> <b>the little ones of the flock.</b> The weakest of the Chaldeans shall drag them away captive. <a ref='Jeremiah 49:23–27'>49:23–27</a> <b>Concerning Damascus.</b> Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 17:1–3'>Is 17:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Amos 1:3–5'>Am 1:3–5</a> . Hamath, a city on the Orontes River that marked the northern limit of Solomon’s rule ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 8:4'>2Chr 8:4</a> ), 110 mi. north of Damascus in southern Syria, and Arpad, 105 mi. southwest of the modern Aleppo in Northern Syria, were to fall, as well as Damascus, Syria’s capital. Nebuchadnezzar conquered them in 605 BC. <a ref='Jeremiah 49:25'>49:25</a> <b>city of praise … My joy!</b> Could be translated “the city of renown,” famous due to its situation in a spacious oasis and its trade, as in <a ref='Ezekiel 27:18'>Eze 27:18</a> . <a ref='Jeremiah 49:27'>49:27</a> <b>fortified towers of Ben-hadad.</b> Here was the place where so many cruel evils against Israel were devised, thus the reason for its overthrow. The name is common among Syrian kings, meaning Son of Hadad, an idol, so it does not refer to the Ben-hadad of <a ref='2 Kings 13:3'>2Ki 13:3</a> and <a ref='Amos 1:4'>Am 1:4</a> . <a ref='Jeremiah 49:28–33'>49:28–33</a> <b>Concerning Kedar … Hazor.</b> Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 21:13–17'>Is 21:13–17</a> . These areas in the Arabian desert east of Judah were to be laid waste (as a different Hazor was a few mi. northwest of the Sea of Galilee). Kedar was an Ishmaelite tribe (cf. <a ref='Genesis 25:13'>Ge 25:13</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 27:21'>Eze 27:21</a> ). The conqueror was Nebuchadnezzar in 599/98 BC as recounted in an ancient record, the Babylonian Chronicle. It was shortly after this that Babylon seized Jerusalem in 598/97 BC. <a ref='Jeremiah 49:31'>49:31</a> <b>no gates or bars.</b> These nomads were out of the way of contending powers in Asia and Africa. <a ref='Jeremiah 49:34–39'>49:34–39</a> <b>concerning Elam.</b> As in <a ref='Jeremiah 25:25'>25:25</a> , Elam (200 mi. east of Babylon and west of the Tigris River) was to be subjugated. Babylon fulfilled this in 596 BC. Later, Cyrus of Persia conquered Elam and incorporated Elamites into the Persian forces that conquered Babylon in 539 BC. Its capital, Susa, was the residence of Darius and became the center of the Persian Empire ( <a ref='Nehemiah 1:1'>Ne 1:1</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 8:2'>Da 8:2</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 49:34'>49:34</a> <b>reign of Zedekiah.</b> Jeremiah speaks of this judgment in 597 BC. <a ref='Jeremiah 49:35'>49:35</a> <b>break the bow.</b> Elamites were famous archers (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 22:6'>Is 22:6</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 49:39'>49:39</a> <b>I will return.</b> As with certain other peoples in this section of nations, God would allow Elamites to return to their homeland. In <a ref='Acts 2:9'>Ac 2:9</a> , Elamites were among the group present at the Pentecost event. This has eschatological implications as well. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:1'>50:1</a> <b>concerning Babylon.</b> The subject of chaps. <a ref='Je 50'>50</a> and <a ref='Je 51'>51</a> (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 13:1–14:23'>Is 13:1—14:23</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 2:6–17'>Hab 2:6–17</a> ). Judgment focuses on Media Persia’s conquest of Babylon in 539 BC. The prediction of elements of violent overthrow, which was not the case when Cyrus conquered since there was not even a battle, points to fulfillment near the coming of Messiah in glory when events more fully satisfy the description (cf. <a ref='Rev 17-18'>Rev 17–18</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 50:2'>50:2</a> <b>idols.</b> First the idols of Babylon are discredited by Jeremiah’s using an unusual word for idols, meaning in Hebrew “dung pellets.” <a ref='Jeremiah 50:3'>50:3</a> <b>no inhabitant.</b> The far view in the v. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:1'>1</a> note cites this as not yet fulfilled in a sudden way (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:8'>51:8</a> ). Media Persia came down from the north in 539 BC, and armies in the years that followed gradually brought the past Babylon to complete desolation (cf. vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:12–13'>12–13</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 50:4–10'>50:4–10</a> <b>sons of Israel will come.</b> Jeremiah predicted a return for exiled Israel and Judah (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:17–20'>17–20</a> , as chaps. <a ref='Je 30-33'>30–33</a> ) as the scattered and penitent people were given opportunity to escape Babylon’s doom and return to Jerusalem and to Yahweh in an eternal covenant (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:5'>5</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 50:5'>50:5</a> in <b>an everlasting covenant.</b> This is the New Covenant summarized in <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31'>31:31</a> . <a ref='Jeremiah 50:11–16'>50:11–16</a> Judgment on Babylon is the vengeance of God (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:15'>15</a> ) for her treatment of His people. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:17–20'>50:17–20</a> This section summarized the divine interpretation of Israel’s history: 1) suffering and judgment on her (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:17'>17</a> ); 2) judgment on those who afflicted Israel (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:18'>18</a> ); 3) her return in peace and plenty (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:19'>19</a> ); and 4) the pardon of her iniquity (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:20'>20</a> ) under Messiah. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:21'>50:21</a> <b>Merathaim … Pekod.</b> This was a dramatic play on words emphasizing cause and effect. The first means “double rebellion” and named a region in southern Babylon near the Persian Gulf; the latter, meaning “punishment,” was also in southern Babylon on the east bank of the Tigris River. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:23'>50:23</a> <b>hammer of the whole earth.</b> The description was of Babylon’s former conquering force, and God’s breaking the “hammer” He had once used. The fact that God used Babylon as His executioner was no commendation of that nation (cf. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:6–7'>Hab 1:6–7</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 50:28'>50:28</a> <b>Vengeance for His temple.</b> This refers to their burning the temple in the destruction of Jerusalem (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:11'>51:11</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 50:29'>50:29</a> <b>Repay her.</b> God aimed to bless Israel and curse all who curse her (cf. <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> , Abrahamic Covenant). The judgment on Babylon, as in <a ref='Hab 2'>Hab 2</a> , was a repayment in view of Babylon’s wrongs as God defends Israel’s case (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:34'>34</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 51:36'>51:36</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 51:56'>56</a> ), particularly God’s vengeance on her arrogance (“arrogant against Yahweh” cf. vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:31–32'>31–32</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 50:34'>50:34</a> <b>Redeemer.</b> The OT concept of kinsmen-redeemer included the protection of a relative’s person and property, the avenging of a relative’s murder, the purchase of alienated property, and even the marriage of his widow (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 25:25'>Lv 25:25</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 35:21'>Nu 35:21</a> ; <a ref='Ruth 4:4'>Ru 4:4</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 50:35–38'>50:35–38</a> The “sword” is mentioned 5 times (cf. <a ref='Eze 21'>Eze 21</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 50:40'>50:40</a> <b>As when God overthrew Sodom.</b> Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:1'>50:1</a> . What befell Sodom (cf. <a ref='Ge 19'>Ge 19</a> ) was sudden and total destruction, not like the Media Persia takeover, but like an example for the future devastation that will overtake the final Babylon (cf. <a ref='Rev 17-18'>Rev 17–18</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 50:41'>50:41</a> <b>from the north.</b> Media Persia in 539 BC. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:41–46'>50:41–46</a> Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 6:22–24'>6:22–24</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 49:19–21'>49:19–21</a> .

The far view looks at the destruction of the final Babylon near the Second Advent when it will be absolutely sudden ( <a ref='Rev 18'>Rev 18</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 51:11'>51:11</a> <b>kings of the Medes.</b> The aggressor was specifically identified (cf. v. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:28'>28</a> ) as the leader of the Medes, assisted by Persia (539 BC). <a ref='Jeremiah 51:15–19'>51:15–19</a> <b>He who made the earth.</b> God’s almighty power and wisdom in creation are evidences of His superiority to all idols (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:17–18'>17–18</a> ), who along with their worshipers will all be destroyed by His mighty power (vv. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:15–16'>15–16</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 51:19'>19</a> ), as in Babylon’s case. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:20–23'>51:20–23</a> <b>You are My</b> instrument <b>of shattering.</b> Cyrus of Persia was God’s war club. Ten times the phrase “with you” hits with the force of a hammer. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:25'>51:25</a> <b>destroying mountain.</b> Though Babylon existed on a plain, this phrase was meant as a portrayal of Babylon’s looming greatness and power in devastating nations (cf. also <a ref='Jeremiah 50:23'>50:23</a> , and <i>see note there</i> ). <b>a burnt out mountain.</b> Babylon will be like a volcano that is extinct, never to be rebuilt (v. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:26'>26</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 51:27'>51:27</a> Here are listed the people north of Babylon who were conquered by the Medes early in the sixth century BC. They assisted the Medes against Babylon. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:31'>51:31</a> <b>To give a message to the king of Babylon.</b> Couriers brought the report of the city’s fall. Since Belshazzar was slain in the city on the night of the fall ( <a ref='Daniel 5:30'>Da 5:30</a> ), reference may be to runners speeding the news to his co-ruler Nabonidus, who was away from Babylon or possibly to Daniel, the third ruler in the kingdom ( <a ref='Daniel 5:29'>Da 5:29</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 51:32'>51:32</a> The method of capturing the city was to block off the Euphrates River and dry up the riverbed under the city wall, then march in. The “fire” was set to frighten and it did. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:39'>51:39</a> <b>drunk.</b> The allusion is possibly to Belshazzar’s drunken feast, recorded in <a ref='Daniel 5:1–4'>Da 5:1–4</a> (cf. v. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:57'>57</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 51:41'>51:41</a> <b>Sheshak has been captured.</b> This is another name for Babylon (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 25:26'>25:26</a> ). <a ref='Jeremiah 51:45–50'>51:45–50</a> Again Yahweh’s people were warned to flee. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:58'>51:58</a> <b>toil for nothing.</b> People from many nations enslaved in Babylon had built the wall for nothing. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:59'>51:59</a> <b>Seraiah was quartermaster.</b> This man looked after the comfort of the king.
