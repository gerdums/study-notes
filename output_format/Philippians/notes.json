This does not suggest that Christ divested himself of any aspect or attribute of His deity.

This did not abrogate or limit His divinity. His divine nature is by definition immutable ( Heb 13:8 )—meaning He retained all the attributes and prerogatives of God, though these were not always revealed to us in Christ’s state of humiliation. At times, He did unveil his divine nature by performing miracles, displaying his omniscience ( Mt 12:25 ), or putting His glory on display ( Mt 17:2 ).
