One month was the usual mourning period for Jews, and the features of this period, e.g., shaving the head, trimming the nails, and removing her lovely clothes (ladies on the eve of captivity dressed to be attractive to their captors), were typical signs of Jewish grief. This action was important to show kindness to the woman and to test the strength of the man’s affection. After the 30 days, they could marry. If later he decided divorce was appropriate (based on the provisions of 24:1–4 ), he could not sell her as a slave.

From the sanctification of the home and marriage in the previous chapter, Moses proceeds to the sanctification of their union as a congregation and speaks of the right of citizenship, including being gathered before the presence of Yahweh to worship Him. Most likely, this law did not exclude one from residence in the area where Israel was to live, but from public offices and honors, intermarriage, and participation in the religious rites at the tabernacle plus later at the temple. The emasculated (v. 1 ), the illegitimate (v. 2 ), and the Ammonites and Moabites (vv. 3–6 ) were not allowed to worship Yahweh. The general rule was that strangers and foreigners, for fear of friendship or marriage connections which would lead Israel into idolatry, were not admissible until their conversion to God and the Jewish faith. This purge, however, describes some limitations to the general rule. Eunuchs, illegitimate children, and people from Ammon and Moab were excluded. Eunuchs were forbidden because such willful mutilation (lit. in Hebrew, by crushing, which was the way such an act was generally performed) violated God’s creation of man, was associated with idolatrous practices, and was done by pagan parents to their children so that they might serve as eunuchs in the homes of the great (cf. 25:11–12 ). The illegitimate were excluded so as to place an indelible stigma as a discouragement to shameful sexual misconduct. People from Ammon and Moab were excluded, not because they were born out of incest (cf. Ge 19:30ff. ), but on account of their vicious hostility toward God and His people Israel. Many of the Israelites were settled east of the Jordan in the immediate neighborhood of these people, so God raised this wall to prevent the evils of idolatrous influence. Individuals from all 3 of these outcast groups are offered grace and acceptance by Isaiah upon personal faith in the true God (cf. Is 56:1–8 ). Ruth the Moabitess serves as a most notable example (cf. Ru 1:4 , 16 )."

Notice the following sequence: 1) if a man finds an uncleanness (some impurity or something vile, cf. 23:14 ) in his wife, other than adultery, which was punished by execution (cf. 22:22 ); 2) if he legally divorces her (although God hates divorce, as Mal 2:16 says; He has designed marriage for life, as Ge 2:24 declares; and He allowed divorce because of hard hearts, as Mt 19:8 reveals); 3) if she then marries another man; 4) if the new husband then dies or divorces her; then that woman could not return to her first husband (v. 4 ). This is so because she was “defiled” with such a defilement that is an abomination to Yahweh and a sinful pollution of the Promised Land. What constitutes that defilement? Only one thing is possible—she was defiled in the remarriage because there was no ground for the divorce. So when she remarried, she became an adulteress ( Mt 5:31–32 ) and is thus defiled so that her former husband can’t take her back. Illegitimate divorce proliferates adultery.

After their rebellion against that covenant, Moses warned them ( Lv 26 ) of the divine judgment that would come if they disobeyed. Here, Moses gives an exhortation based upon the blessings and the curses of the covenant (see Lv 26:1–45 ). The blessings and the curses in this chapter follow the same structure. First, Moses clearly explained that the quality of Israel’s future experience would come on the basis of obedience or disobedience to God ( 28:1–2 , 15 ). Second, the actual blessings and curses were succinctly stated ( 28:3–6 , 16–19 ). Third, Moses gave a sermonic elaboration of the basic blessings and curses ( 28:7–14 , 20–68 ). Just as the curses were given more prominence in the ceremony of 27:11–26 , so the curses incurred by disobedience to the covenant were much more fully developed here. The perspective of Moses was that Israel would not prove faithful to the covenant ( 31:16–18 , 27 ) and so would not enjoy the blessings of the covenant; therefore, the curses received much more attention."

However, Israel’s neglect of God’s goodness and her apostasy (vv. 15–18 ) would bring God’s future outpouring of wrath on His people (vv. 19–27 ) and Israel’s continuing blindness in the face of God’s wrath (vv. 28–33 ). Ultimately, God’s vengeance would strip Israel of all power and turn the nation from idolatry (vv. 34–38 ). Then, God would bring His judgment upon the nations, both His enemies and Israel’s (vv. 39–42 ).
