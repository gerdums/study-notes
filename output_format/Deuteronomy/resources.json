    "content": "Deuteronomy Title The English title “Deuteronomy” comes from the Greek Septuagint (LXX) mistranslation of “copy of this law” in <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:18'>17:18</a> as “second law,” which was rendered <i>Deuteronomium</i> in the Latin version (Vulgate). The Hebrew title of the book is translated “These are the words,” from the first two Hebrew words of the book. The Hebrew title is a better description of the book since it is not a “second law,” but rather the record of Moses’ words of explanation concerning the law. Deuteronomy completes the five-part literary unit called the Pentateuch. Author and Date Moses has been traditionally recognized as the author of Deuteronomy, since the book itself testifies that Moses wrote it ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:1'>1:1</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:5'>5</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:9'>31:9</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:22'>22</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:24'>24</a> ). Both the OT ( <a ref='1 Kings 2:3'>1Ki 2:3</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 8:53'>8:53</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 14:6'>2Ki 14:6</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 18:12'>18:12</a> ) and the NT ( <a ref='Acts 3:22–23'>Ac 3:22–23</a> ; <a ref='Romans 10:19'>Ro 10:19</a> ) support the claim of Mosaic authorship. While <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:48–34:12'>Dt 32:48—34:12</a> was added after Moses’ death (probably by Joshua), the rest of the book came from Moses’ hand just before his death in 1405 BC. The majority of the book is comprised of farewell speeches that the 120-year-old Moses gave to Israel, beginning on the first day of the 11th month of the 40th year after the Exodus from Egypt ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:3'>1:3</a> ). These speeches can be dated Jan.–Feb., 1405 BC. In the last few weeks of Moses’ life, he committed these speeches to writing and gave them to the priests and elders for the coming generations of Israel ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:9'>31:9</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:24–26'>24–26</a> ). Background and Setting Like Leviticus, Deuteronomy does not advance historically, but takes place entirely in one location over about one month of time (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:3'>Dt 1:3</a> and <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:8'>34:8</a> with <a ref='Joshua 5:6–12'>Jos 5:6–12</a> ). Israel was encamped in the central rift valley to the east of the Jordan River ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:1'>Dt 1:1</a> ). This location was referred to in <a ref='Numbers 36:13'>Nu 36:13</a> as “the plains of Moab,” an area north of the Arnon River across the Jordan River from Jericho. It had been almost 40 years since the Israelites had exited Egypt. The book of Deuteronomy concentrates on events that took place in the final weeks of Moses’ life. The major event was the verbal communication of divine revelation from Moses to the people of Israel ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:1–30:20'>1:1—30:20</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:30–32:47'>31:30—32:47</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:1–29'>33:1–29</a> ). The only other events recorded were: 1) Moses’ recording the law in a book and his commissioning of Joshua as the new leader ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:1–29'>31:1–29</a> ); 2) Moses’ viewing of the land of Canaan from Mt. Nebo ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:48–52'>32:48–52</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:1–4'>34:1–4</a> ); and 3) his death ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:5–12'>34:5–12</a> ). The original recipients of Deuteronomy, both in its verbal and written presentations, were the second generation of the nation of Israel (except Joshua and Caleb, who were older). All of that generation, from 40 to 60 years of age, had been born in Egypt and had participated as children or teens in the Exodus. Those under 40 had been born and reared in the wilderness. Together, they comprised the generation that was on the verge of conquering the land of Canaan under Joshua, 40 years after they had left Egypt ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:34–39'>1:34–39</a> ). Historical and Theological Themes Like Leviticus, Deuteronomy contains much legal detail, but with an emphasis on the people rather than the priests. As Moses called the second generation of Israel to trust the Lord and be obedient to His covenant made at Horeb (Sinai), he illustrated his points with references to Israel’s past history. He reminded Israel of her rebellion against the Lord at Horeb ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 9:7–10:11'>9:7—10:11</a> ) and at Kadesh ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:26–46'>1:26–46</a> ), which brought devastating consequences. He also reminded her of the Lord’s faithfulness in giving victory over her enemies ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:24–3:11'>2:24—3:11</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:2'>29:2</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:7–8'>7–8</a> ). Most importantly, Moses called the people to take the land that God had promised by oath to their forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:8'>1:8</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:10'>6:10</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 9:5'>9:5</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:13'>29:13</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:20'>30:20</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:4'>34:4</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 15:18–21'>Ge 15:18–21</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 26:3–5'>26:3–5</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 35:12'>35:12</a> ). Moses not only looked back, he also looked ahead and saw that Israel’s future failure to obey God would lead to her being scattered among the nations before the fulfillment of His oath to the patriarchs would be completed ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:25–31'>4:25–31</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:22–30:10'>29:22—30:10</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:26–29'>31:26–29</a> ). The book of Deuteronomy, along with Psalms and Isaiah, reveals much about the attributes of God. Thus, it is directly quoted over 40 times in the NT (exceeded only by Psalms and Isaiah) with many more allusions to its content. Deuteronomy reveals that the Lord is the only God ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:39'>4:39</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:4'>6:4</a> ), and that He is jealous ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:24'>4:24</a> ), faithful ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:9'>7:9</a> ), loving ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:13'>7:13</a> ), merciful ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:31'>4:31</a> ), yet angered by sin ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:15'>6:15</a> ). This is the God who called Israel to Himself. Over 250 times, Moses repeated the phrase, “Yahweh your God” to Israel. Israel was called to obey ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:2'>28:2</a> ), fear ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:12'>10:12</a> ), love ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:12'>10:12</a> ), and serve ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:12'>10:12</a> ) her God by walking in His ways and keeping His commandments ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:12–13'>10:12–13</a> ). By obeying Him, the people of Israel would receive His blessings ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:1–14'>28:1–14</a> ). Obedience and the pursuit of personal holiness is always based upon the character of God. Because of who He is, His people are to be holy (cf., <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:6–11'>7:6–11</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 8:6'>8:6</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 8:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 8:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:12'>10:12</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:16–17'>16–17</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:13'>11:13</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 13:3–4'>13:3–4</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 14:1–2'>14:1–2</a> ). Interpretive Challenges Three interpretive challenges face the reader of Deuteronomy. First, is the book a singular record, or is it only a part of the larger literary whole, the Pentateuch? The remainder of the Scripture always views the Pentateuch as a unit, and the ultimate meaning of Deuteronomy cannot be divorced from its context in the Pentateuch. The book also assumes the reader is already familiar with the 4 books that precede it; in fact, Deuteronomy brings into focus all that had been revealed in Genesis to Numbers, as well as its implications for the people as they entered the land. However, every available Hebrew manuscript divides the Pentateuch in exactly the same way as the present text, indicating that the book is a well-defined unit recounting the final speeches of Moses to Israel, so it may also be viewed as a singular record. Second, is the structure of Deuteronomy based on the secular treaties of Moses’ day? During the last 35 years, many evangelical scholars have supported the Mosaic authorship of Deuteronomy by appealing to the similarities between the structure of the book and the ancient Near Eastern treaty form of the mid-second millennium BC (the approximate time of Moses). These secular suzerainty treaties (i.e., a ruler dictating his will to his vassals) followed a set pattern not used in the mid-first millennium BC. These treaties usually contained the following elements: 1) preamble—identifying the parties to the covenant; 2) historical prologue—a history of the king’s dealing with his vassals; 3) general and specific stipulations; 4) witnesses; 5) blessings and curses; and 6) oaths and covenant ratification. Deuteronomy, it is believed, approximates this basic structure. While there is agreement that <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:1–5'>1:1–5</a> is a preamble, <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:5–4:43'>1:5—4:43</a> a historical prologue, and chaps. <a ref='De 27-28'>27–28</a> feature blessings and cursings, there is no consensus as to how the rest of Deuteronomy fits this structure. While there might have been a covenant renewal on the plains of Moab, this is neither clearly explicit nor implicit in Deuteronomy. It is best to take the book for what it claims to be: the explanation of the law given by Moses for the new generation. The structure follows the speeches given by Moses. See Outline. Third, what was the covenant made in the land of Moab ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:1'>29:1</a> )? The majority opinion posits this covenant as a renewal of the Sinaitic Covenant made nearly 40 years before with the first generation. Here, Moses supposedly updated and renewed this same covenant with the second generation of Israel. The second view sees this covenant as a Palestinian Covenant which guarantees the nation of Israel’s right to the land, both at that time and in the future. A third position is that Moses in chaps. <a ref='De 29-30'>29–30</a> anticipated the New Covenant, since he knew Israel would fail to keep the Sinaitic Covenant. The third view seems the best.

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:1–4'>1:1–4</a> This introduction gives the setting of Deuteronomy and its purpose. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>the words which Moses spoke.</b> Almost all of Deuteronomy consists of speeches given by Moses at the end of his life. According to v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:3'>3</a> , Moses acted upon the authority of God since his inspired words were in accordance with the commandments that God had given. <b>to all Israel.</b> This expression is used 12 times in this book and emphasizes the unity of Israel, and the universal applications of these words. <b>the Arabah opposite Suph.</b> Except for Jordan and the Arabah (see note ), the exact location of the places named in <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:1'>1:1</a> is not known with certainty, although they may have been along Israel’s route north from the Gulf of Aqabah (cf. <a ref='Nu 33'>Nu 33</a> ). The plain referred to is the large rift valley that extends from the Sea of Galilee in the north to the Gulf of Aqabah in the south. Israel was encamped to the east of the Jordan River in this valley. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>eleven days’</b> journey. The distance from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea was about 150 mi. Kadesh was on the southern border of the Promised Land. This trip took 11 days on foot, but for Israel lasted 38 more years. <b>Horeb.</b> The usual name in Deuteronomy for Mt.

Moses introduced his explanation of the law with a call to enter the land of Canaan (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:6–8'>6–8</a> ), which had been promised by the Abrahamic Covenant from God (cf. <a ref='Genesis 15:18–21'>Ge 15:18–21</a> ). Throughout this book, he refers to that covenant promise ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:35'>1:35</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:31'>4:31</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:10'>6:10</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:18'>18</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:8'>7:8</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 8:1'>8:1</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 8:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 9:5'>9:5</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:11'>10:11</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:9'>11:9</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:21'>21</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 13:17'>13:17</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:8'>19:8</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:3'>26:3</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:3'>27:3</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:11'>28:11</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:13'>29:13</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:20'>30:20</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:7'>31:7</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:20–23'>20–23</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:4'>34:4</a> ). He then gave a historical review of God’s gracious acts ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:9–3:29'>1:9—3:29</a> ) and a call to Israel for obedience to the covenant given to them by Yahweh at Sinai ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:1–40'>4:1–40</a> ). This introductory section ends with a brief narrative recounting the appointment of the 3 cities of refuge east of the Jordan ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:41–43'>4:41–43</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>expound.</b> To make clear, distinct, or plain. The purpose of the book was to make the sense and purpose of the law clear to the people as they entered the land. It was to be their guide to the law while living in the land. Moses did not review what happened at Horeb (Sinai), which is recorded by him in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers (cf. <a ref='Exodus 20:1'>Ex 20:1</a> – <a ref='Numbers 10:10'>Nu 10:10</a> ), but rather gave Israel instruction in how to walk with God and how to fulfill God’s will in the land and be blessed. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:7–8'>1:7–8</a> <b>the land.</b> The land which Yahweh set before Israel to go in and possess was clearly described in v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:7'>7</a> . The hill country of the Amorites referred to the mountainous territory west of the Dead Sea. The Arabah was the land in the rift valley from the Sea of Galilee in the north to the Dead Sea in the south. The hill country referred to the hills that run through the center of the land north and south. These hills are to the west of the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan River. The Shephelah referred to the low rolling hills that sloped toward the Mediterranean coast. The Negev described the dry wasteland stretching southward from Beersheba to the wilderness. The seacoast referred to the land along the Mediterranean Sea. The boundaries of the land of the Canaanites were given in <a ref='Numbers 34:1–15'>Nu 34:1–15</a> . Lebanon to the north marked the northwestern boundary on the coast. The northeast boundary of the land was the Euphrates River. Cf. <a ref='Numbers 34:1–12'>Nu 34:1–12</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>Yahweh swore.</b> God’s command to take possession of this land by conquest was based upon the promise of the land that had been given in a covenant to Abraham ( <a ref='Genesis 15:18–21'>Ge 15:18–21</a> ) and reiterated to Isaac and Jacob ( <a ref='Genesis 26:3–5'>Ge 26:3–5</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 28:13–15'>28:13–15</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 35:12'>35:12</a> ). These 3 patriarchs are mentioned 7 times in Deuteronomy ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:8'>1:8</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:10'>6:10</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 9:5'>9:5</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 9:27'>27</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:13'>29:13</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:20'>30:20</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:4'>34:4</a> ). Yahweh sealed His promise to the patriarchs with an oath (swore) indicating that He would never change His plan (cf. <a ref='Psalms 110:4'>Ps 110:4</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:9–18'>1:9–18</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Ex 18'>Ex 18</a></i> for the background. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:10'>1:10</a> <b>the stars of heaven.</b> Yahweh had promised Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars in the sky (see <a ref='Genesis 15:5'>Ge 15:5</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 22:17'>22:17</a> ). The nation’s growth proved both God’s intention and ability to fulfill His original promises to Abraham. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>a thousand-fold.</b> A Semitic way of saying “an infinitely large number.” <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>Choose wise … men.</b> The fulfillment of God’s promise to give to Abraham such a large posterity created a problem for Moses. The nation had become too large for Moses to govern effectively. The solution was the appointment by Moses of men to help him lead the people (see <a ref='Exodus 18:13–27'>Ex 18:13–27</a> ). These men were to be 1) wise, i.e., men who knew how to apply their knowledge; 2) discerning, i.e., those who had understanding and so were able to judge; and 3) experienced, i.e., knowledgeable and respected. Cf. <a ref='Exodus 18:21'>Ex 18:21</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:19–21'>1:19–21</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Numbers 10:11–12:16'>Nu 10:11—12:16</a></i> for the background. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:22–46'>1:22–46</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Nu 13-14'>Nu 13–14</a></i> for the background. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:22'>1:22</a> <b>Let us send men before us.</b> When challenged by Moses to take the land (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:20–21'>20–21</a> ), the people requested that spies be sent first. Moses, it seems, took their request to Yahweh, who also approved their plan and commanded Moses to appoint the spies ( <a ref='Numbers 13:1–2'>Nu 13:1–2</a> ). Thus, Moses selected 12 men who went to see what the land was like ( <a ref='Numbers 13:17–20'>Nu 13:17–20</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:26'>1:26</a> <b>but rebelled.</b> Israel, at Kadesh-barnea, deliberately and defiantly refused to respond to God’s command to take the land ( <a ref='Numbers 14:1–9'>Nu 14:1–9</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:27'>1:27</a> <b>you grumbled.</b> Israel complained in their tents that Yahweh hated them. They assumed Yahweh brought them from Egypt to have them destroyed by the Amorites. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:28'>1:28</a> <b>the Anakim.</b> Lit. “sons of the Anakim” (i.e., the Anakites). The Anakites were early inhabitants of Canaan described as “great and tall” ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:10'>2:10</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:21'>21</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 9:2'>9:2</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 13:32–33'>Nu 13:32–33</a> ). They were larger than the Israelites and were especially feared because of their military power. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:32'>1:32</a> <b>you did not believe Yahweh your God.</b> The failure of the people to take the land at the beginning of their time in the wilderness was explained here in the same way as in <a ref='Numbers 14:11'>Nu 14:11</a> . Israel did not take Yahweh at His Word and, therefore, did not obey His command. The Israelites’ lack of obedience is explained as the outcome of their lack of faith in Yahweh. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:33'>1:33</a> <b>in fire … and cloud.</b> The cloud by day and the fire by night were the means of God’s direction for Israel in the wilderness ( <a ref='Exodus 13:21'>Ex 13:21</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 9:15–23'>Nu 9:15–23</a> ). Yahweh who guided Israel through the wandering journey was the same Lord who had already searched out a place for Israel in the land. As He had directed them in the past, He would direct them also in the future. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:36–38'>1:36–38</a> <b>Caleb … Joshua.</b> They were excluded from this judgment because of exemplary faith and obedience (cf. <a ref='Numbers 14:24'>Nu 14:24</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 14:8–9'>Jos 14:8–9</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:37'>1:37</a> <b>Yahweh was angry with me.</b> Although his disobedience occurred almost 39 years after the failure of Israel at Kadesh ( <a ref='Numbers 20:1–13'>Nu 20:1–13</a> ), Moses included it here with Israel’s disobedience to Yahweh because his disobedience was of the same kind. Moses, like Israel, failed to honor the Word of Yahweh and thus, in rebellion for self glory, disobeyed God’s clear command and struck the rock rather than speaking to it. Thus, he suffered the same result of God’s anger and, like Israel, was not allowed to go into the land ( <a ref='Numbers 20:12'>Nu 20:12</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:41–45'>1:41–45</a> Israel’s further defiance of Yahweh’s command was shown by their presumption in seeking to go into the land after God said they should not. This time they rebelled by attempting to go in and conquer the land, only to be chased back by the Amorites. Yahweh showed His displeasure by not helping them or sympathizing with their defeat, and for that generation there was no escape from death in the desert during the next 38 years (cf. <a ref='Nu 15-19'>Nu 15–19</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:46'>1:46</a> <b>you remained in Kadesh many days.</b> These words suggest that Israel spent a large part of the 38 years in the wilderness around Kadesh-barnea. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:1–3:11'>2:1—3:11</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Numbers 20:14–21:35'>Nu 20:14—21:35</a></i> for the background. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:1–23'>2:1–23</a> This section deals with encounters with Israel’s relatives, the Edomites (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:1–8'>1–8</a> ), Moabites (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:9–18'>9–18</a> ), and Ammonites (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:19–23'>19–23</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>the way to the Red Sea.</b> Cf. <a ref='Numbers 21:4'>Nu 21:4</a> . After spending a long time at Kadesh, the Israelites set out once again at the command of Yahweh through Moses. They traveled away from their Promised Land in a southeasterly direction from Kadesh toward the Gulf of Aqabah on the road to the Red Sea. Thus began the wanderings that were about to end. <b>circled Mount Seir.</b> Israel spent many days wandering in the vicinity of Mt. Seir, the mountain range of Edom, south of the Dead Sea and extending down the eastern flank of the Arabah. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:3'>2:3</a> <b>turn north.</b> The departure from Kadesh had been in a southeasterly direction away from the Promised Land, until Yahweh commanded Israel to turn again northward in the direction of the Promised Land. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:4'>2:4</a> <b>your brothers the sons of Esau.</b> Esau was the brother of Jacob ( <a ref='Genesis 25:25–26'>Ge 25:25–26</a> ). The Edomites, the descendants of Esau, lived in Mt. Seir. According to <a ref='Numbers 20:14–21'>Nu 20:14–21</a> , the Edomites refused to allow Israel to pass through their land. Verse <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:8'>8</a> , reflecting this refusal, states that the Israelites went around the border of the descendants of Esau, i.e., to the east of their territory. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:5'>2:5</a> <b>I will not give you any of their land.</b> God had granted to the descendants of Esau an inheritance (Mt. Seir was their possession). In v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:9'>9</a> , the same is said about the Moabites and in v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:19'>19</a> , about the Ammonites. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:8'>2:8</a> <b>from Elath and from Ezion-geber.</b> Two towns located just north of the Gulf of Aqabah. Israel passed to the east of Edom and to the east of Moab on their journey northward. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:10'>2:10</a> <b>The Emim.</b> Apparently a Moabite term (see v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:11'>11</a> ) meaning “terrible ones.” This people, numerous and tall, were the pre-Moabite occupants of the land of Moab. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:12'>2:12</a> <b>their possession which Yahweh gave to them.</b> The Horites were Hurrians, a people who lived in various places in Syria and Canaan. Those living in the region of Seir had been displaced by the descendants of Esau. The displacement of the Horites by the Edomites was analogous to the Israelites’ possession of their own land. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:13'>2:13</a> <b>Zered.</b> A brook that ran into the Dead Sea from the southeast. It seems to have constituted the southern boundary of Moab. In contrast to the disobedience associated with Kadesh, the people obeyed the command to cross over the brook Zered. There was a new spirit of obedience toward Yahweh among the people. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:14'>2:14</a> <b>thirty-eight years.</b> From 1444–1406 BC. These were the years from the failure at Kadesh to the obedience at Zered. It was during this time that the rebellious generation, who had been denied access to the Promised Land by the oath of Yahweh, had all died. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:20'>2:20</a> <b>Zamzummin.</b> Apparently an Ammonite term used to describe their precursors in their land. They were characterized as being as tall as the Anakim. But Yahweh had destroyed them and given their land to the Ammonites. This was an encouragement to the Israelites that God could also defeat the Anakim in the land of Canaan and give that land to Israel. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:23'>2:23</a> <b>the Avvim.</b> The ancient village dwellers of southwestern Palestine along the Mediterranean coast as far as the city of Gaza. <b>the Caphtorim.</b> Caphtor probably refers to Crete and may be a reference to an early Philistine group from that island who invaded the coast of Palestine, defeated the Avvim, and then dwelt there. These Caphtorim were precursors to the later, greater Philistine invasion of ca. 1200 BC. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:24–3:29'>2:24—3:29</a> Moses continues the historical survey detailing the defeat of two Amorite kings, Sihon and Og, and the takeover of their territory. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:24'>2:24</a> <b>the valley of Arnon.</b> The northern boundary of Moab. Israel was allowed to attack Sihon the Amorite because the Amorites were not relatives of Israel. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:25'>2:25</a> <b>fear of you.</b> As the conquest began, God put the fear of Israel into the hearts of their enemies. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:26'>2:26</a> <b>the wilderness of Kedemoth.</b> Kedemoth means “eastern regions.” It was probably a few mi. north of the Arnon River and near to the eastern border of the Amorite state. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:27'>2:27</a> <b>Let me pass through.</b> As with the Edomites previously ( <a ref='Numbers 20:17'>Nu 20:17</a> ), Moses asked to pass peacefully through the territory of Sihon. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:30'>2:30</a> <b>stiffened his spirit.</b> Sihon, by his own conscious will, refused Israel’s request to journey through his land. God confirmed what was already in Sihon’s heart, namely arrogance against Yahweh and His people Israel, so that He might defeat him in battle and give his land to Israel. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:32'>2:32</a> <b>Jahaz.</b> The place of battle between Sihon and the Israelites, probably a few mi. to the north of Kedemoth (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:26'>26</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 3:1'>3:1</a> <b>Bashan.</b> A fertile region located east of the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan River extending from Mt. Hermon in the north to the Yarmuk River in the south. Israel met King Og and his army in battle at Edrei, a city on the Yarmuk River. The Amorite king ruled over 60 cities (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 3:4–10'>4–10</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 13:30'>Jos 13:30</a> ), which were taken by Israel; this kingdom was assigned to the Transjordanic tribes, especially the half-tribe of Manasseh (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 3:13'>13</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 3:8'>3:8</a> <b>beyond the Jordan.</b> East of the Jordan River, Israel controlled the territory from the Arnon River to Mt. Hermon, a length of about 150 mi. Note that the perspective of the speaker was to the east of the Jordan; the west of the Jordan still needed to be conquered. This statement helps date these speeches as preconquest. <a ref='Deuteronomy 3:11'>3:11</a> <b>an iron bedstead.</b> The bedstead may actually have been a coffin, which would have been large enough to also hold tomb objects. The size of the “bedstead,” 13 1/2 by 6 ft., emphasized the largeness of Og, who was a giant (the last of the Rephaim, a race of giants). As God had given Israel victory over the giant Og, so He would give them victory over the giants in the land. <a ref='Deuteronomy 3:12–20'>3:12–20</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Numbers 32:1–42'>Nu 32:1–42</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 34:13–15'>34:13–15</a></i> for background. <a ref='Deuteronomy 3:20'>3:20</a> <b>rest.</b> A peaceful situation with the land free from external threat and oppression.

However, Yahweh would not allow Moses that privilege. He did, however, allow Moses to go to the top of Pisgah and see the land (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:48–52'>Dt 32:48–52</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:1–4'>34:1–4</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 3:26'>3:26</a> <b>Yahweh was angry.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:37'>1:37</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:21–24'>4:21–24</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 3:29'>3:29</a> <b>Beth-peor.</b> Located east of the Jordan River, probably opposite Jericho ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Nu 22-25'>Nu 22–25</a></i> for the background). <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:1'>4:1</a> <b>O Israel, listen.</b> Moses called the people to hear and obey the rules of conduct that God had given them to observe.

Thus, this law, the gift of God at Horeb, could not be supplemented or reduced. Anything that adulterated or contradicted God’s law would not be tolerated (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:32'>12:32</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 30:6'>Pr 30:6</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 22:18–19'>Rev 22:18–19</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:3–4'>4:3–4</a> Moses used the incident at Baal-peor ( <a ref='Numbers 25:1–9'>Nu 25:1–9</a> ) to illustrate from the Israelites’ own history that their very lives depended on obeying God’s law. Only those who had held fast to Yahweh by obeying His commands were alive that day to hear Moses. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:6'>4:6</a> <b>the peoples.</b> Israel’s obedience to God’s law would provide a testimony to the world that God was near to His people and that His laws were righteous. One purpose of the law was to make Israel morally and spiritually unique among all the nations and, therefore, draw those nations to the one true and living God. They were from their beginnings to be a witness nation. Though they failed and have been temporarily set aside, the prophets revealed that in the future kingdom of Messiah they will be a nation of faithful witnesses (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 45:14'>Is 45:14</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 8:23'>Zec 8:23</a> ). <b>a wise and understanding people.</b> The nations would see 3 things in Israel (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:6–8'>6–8</a> ). First, the Israelites would know how to apply God’s knowledge so as to have discernment and to be able to judge matters accurately. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:7'>4:7</a> <b>a god so near to it.</b> Second, faithfulness to Yahweh would allow the nations to see that Yahweh had established intimacy with Israel. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:8'>4:8</a> <b>statutes and judgments as righteous.</b> Third, the nations would see that Israel’s law was distinctive, for its source was Yahweh indicating its character was righteous. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:9–31'>4:9–31</a> This section carries the most basic lesson for Israel to learn—to fear and reverence God. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:9'>4:9</a> <b>make them known to your sons.</b> Deuteronomy stresses the responsibility of parents to pass on their experiences with God and the knowledge they have gained from Him to their children (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:7'>6:7</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:19'>11:19</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:10'>4:10</a> Remember <b>the day.</b> One experience of Israel to be passed on from generation to generation was the great theophany (the self-revelation of God in physical form) which took place at Horeb (cf. <a ref='Exodus 19:9–20:19'>Ex 19:9—20:19</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:12'>4:12</a> <b>no form.</b> Israel was to remember that when God revealed Himself at Sinai, His presence came through His voice, i.e., the sound of His words. They did not see Him. God is Spirit ( <a ref='John 4:24'>Jn 4:24</a> ), which rules out any idolatrous representation of God in any physical form (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:16–18'>16–18</a> ) or any worship of the created order (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:19'>19</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:13'>4:13</a> <b>the Ten Commandments.</b> Lit. “ten statements,” from which comes the term “Decalogue.” These summarize and epitomize all the commandments Yahweh gave to Israel through Moses. Though the phrase occurs only here, in <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:4'>10:4</a> , and in <a ref='Exodus 34:28'>Ex 34:28</a> , there are 26 more references to it in Deuteronomy ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 19:16–21'>Mt 19:16–21</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 22:35–40'>22:35–40</a> ; <a ref='Mark 10:17–22'>Mk 10:17–22</a> ; <a ref='Romans 13:8–10'>Ro 13:8–10</a></i> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:15–19'>4:15–19</a> This is a strong emphasis on commandments one and two (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:18–23'>Ro 1:18–23</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:20'>4:20</a> <b>the iron furnace.</b> A fire was used to heat iron sufficiently to be hammered into different shapes or welded to other objects. The iron furnace here suggests that Israel’s time in Egypt was a period of ordeal, testing, and purifying for the Hebrews, readying them for usefulness as God’s witness nation. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:24'>4:24</a> <b>a jealous God.</b> God is zealous to protect what belongs to Him. He will not allow another to have the honor that is due to Him alone (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 42:8'>Is 42:8</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 48:11'>48:11</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:25–31'>4:25–31</a> Cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 8:18–19'>8:18–19</a> . In fact, this briefly outlined the future judgment of Israel, which culminated in the northern 10 tribes being exiled to Assyria (ca. 722 BC; <a ref='2Ki 17'>2Ki 17</a> ) and the southern two tribes being deported to Babylon (ca. 605–586 BC; <a ref='2Ki 24-25'>2Ki 24–25</a> ). Although the Jews returned in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah (ca. 538–445 BC), they never regained their autonomy or dominance. Thus, the days of promised restoration and return look forward to Messiah’s return to set up the millennial kingdom. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:27'>4:27</a> <b>Yahweh will scatter you.</b> Moses warned Israel that the judgment for idolatry would be their dispersion among the nations by Yahweh (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:64–67'>28:64–67</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:30'>4:30</a> <b>the last days.</b> Lit. “the end of days.” Moses saw in the distant future a time when repentant Israel would turn again to Yahweh and obey Him. Throughout the Pentateuch, “the last days” refers to the time when Messiah will establish His kingdom (see <a ref='Genesis 49:1'>Ge 49:1</a> , <a ref='Genesis 49:8–12'>8–12</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 24:14–24'>Nu 24:14–24</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:39–43'>Dt 32:39–43</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:31'>4:31</a> <b>the covenant with your fathers.</b> God mercifully, not because they deserve it, will fulfill the covenant He made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with repentant Israel in the future. God will not forget the Word that He has given to Abraham and his seed (cf. <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:32–40'>4:32–40</a> A historical apologetic, appealing for the nation’s obedience to God’s law. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:32–39'>4:32–39</a> <b>since the day that God created man on the earth.</b> In all of human history, no other nation has had the privilege that Israel had of hearing God speak, as He did in giving the law at Mt. Sinai, and surviving such an awesome experience. Nor had any other people been so blessed, chosen and delivered from bondage by such mighty miracles as Israel saw. God did this to reveal to them that He alone is God (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:35'>35</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:39'>39</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:37'>4:37</a> <b>He personally.</b> Lit. “His face.” God Himself had brought Israel out of Egypt. The Exodus resulted from the electing love that God had for the patriarchs and their descendants. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:40'>4:40</a> Such gracious privilege, as remembered in vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:32–39'>32–39</a> , should elicit obedience, particularly in view of the unconditional promise that the Land will be theirs permanently (“for all time”) as is detailed in chaps. <a ref='De 29-30'>29–30</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:41–43'>4:41–43</a> These 3 verses are a narrative insertion at the end of Moses’ speech. The setting aside of 3 cities on the east side of the Jordan by Moses showed that Moses willingly obeyed the commandments God gave him. He was an example of the type of obedience that God was calling for in <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:1–40'>4:1–40</a> (cf. <a ref='Numbers 35:14'>Nu 35:14</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 20:8–9'>Jos 20:8–9</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:44–28:68'>4:44—28:68</a> The heart of Deuteronomy is found in this long second speech of Moses. “Now this is the law” ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:44'>4:44</a> ) which Moses explained to Israel (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:5'>1:5</a> ). After a brief introduction ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:44–49'>4:44–49</a> ), Moses gave the people a clear understanding of what the law directed concerning their relationship with Yahweh in the land ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:1–26:19'>5:1—26:19</a> ), then concluded by recounting the blessings or the curses which would come upon the nation as a consequence of their response to the stipulations of this law ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:1–28:68'>27:1—28:68</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:45'>4:45</a> <b>testimonies … statutes … judgments.</b> God’s instruction to Israel was set forth in: 1) the testimonies, the basic covenant stipulations ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:6–21'>5:6–21</a> ); 2) statutes, words that were inscribed and therefore fixed; and 3) ordinances, the decisions made by a judge on the merits of the situation. This law was given to Israel when they came out of Egypt. Moses is not giving further law, he is now explaining that which has already been given. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:48'>4:48</a> <b>Mount Sion.</b> This reference to Mt.

Then, in <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:1–11:32'>6:1—11:32</a> , Moses expounded and applied the first 3 of the Ten Commandments to the present experience of the people. <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:1'>5:1</a> <b>Hear, O Israel.</b> The verb “hear” carried the sense “obey.” A hearing that leads to obedience was demanded of all the people (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:4'>6:4</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 9:1'>9:1</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:3'>20:3</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:9'>27:9</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:2'>5:2</a> <b>a covenant with us at Horeb.</b> The second generation of Israel, while children, received the covenant that God made with Israel at Sinai. <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:3'>5:3</a> <b>did not cut this covenant with our fathers.</b> The “fathers” were not the people’s immediate fathers, who had died in the wilderness, but their more distant ancestors, the patriarchs (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:31'>4:31</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:37'>37</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:8'>7:8</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 8:18'>8:18</a> ). The Sinaitic or Mosaic Covenant was in addition to and distinct from the Abrahamic Covenant made with the patriarchs. <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:6–21'>5:6–21</a> The first 4 commandments involve relationship with God, the last 6 deal with human relationships. Together they were the foundation of Israel’s life before God. Moses here reiterated them as given originally at Sinai. Slight variations from the Exodus text are accounted for by Moses’ explanatory purpose in Deuteronomy. <i>See notes on <a ref='Exodus 20:1–17'>Ex 20:1–17</a></i> for an additional explanation of these commands. <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:7'>5:7</a> <b>no other gods.</b> Cf. <a ref='Exodus 20:3'>Ex 20:3</a> . “Other gods” were nonexistent pagan gods, which were made in the form of idols and shaped by the minds of their worshipers.

Cf. <a ref='Matthew 16:24–27'>Mt 16:24–27</a> ; <a ref='Mark 8:34–38'>Mk 8:34–38</a> ; <a ref='Luke 9:23–26'>Lk 9:23–26</a> ; <a ref='Luke 14:26–33'>14:26–33</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:8'>5:8</a> <b>an idol … any likeness.</b> Cf. <a ref='Exodus 20:4–5'>Ex 20:4–5</a> .

It was to these adults that Moses could say, “Your own eyes have seen all the great work of Yahweh which He did” (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:7'>7</a> ). It was that specially blessed generation of adults that were called to pass on the teaching of what they had learned to their children (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:19'>19</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:6'>11:6</a> <b>Dathan and Abiram.</b> These two sons of Eliab, of the tribe of Reuben, had rebelled against the authority of Moses, Yahweh’s chosen leader. The basis of their complaint was that Moses had brought Israel out of Egypt, a fertile and prosperous land, and not brought them into Canaan. Because of their rebellion against Moses, God had judged them by having the earth open and swallow them up (see <a ref='Numbers 16:12–14'>Nu 16:12–14</a> , <a ref='Numbers 16:25–27'>25–27</a> , <a ref='Numbers 16:31–33'>31–33</a> ).

God’s acts were to be “seen” for them in the Word of Scripture. It was to be in Moses’ words that the acts of God would be put before the eyes of their children. The first priority, therefore, was given to Scripture as the means of teaching the law and grace of God (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:6–9'>6:6–9</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:24'>11:24</a> <b>Every place … your foot treads.</b> In response to the obedience of Israel (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:22–23'>22–23</a> ), Yahweh promised to give to Israel all of the land they personally traversed to the extent of the boundaries that He had given. This same promise was repeated in <a ref='Joshua 1:3–5'>Jos 1:3–5</a> . Had Israel obeyed God faithfully, her boundaries would have been enlarged to fulfill the promise made to Abraham ( <a ref='Genesis 15:18'>Ge 15:18</a> ). But because of Israel’s disobedience, the complete promise of the whole land still remains, to be fulfilled in the future kingdom of Messiah (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 36:8–38'>Eze 36:8–38</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:26–32'>11:26–32</a> As a final motive for driving home the importance of obedience and trust in God, Moses gave instruction for a ceremony which the people were to carry out when they entered the land. They were to read the blessings and the curses of the covenant on Mt. Gerizim and Mt. Ebal (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:1–14'>27:1–14</a> ) as they actually would do later ( <a ref='Joshua 8:30–35'>Jos 8:30–35</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:1–26:19'>12:1—26:19</a> Having delineated the general principles of Israel’s relationship with Yahweh ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:1–11:32'>5:1—11:32</a> ), Moses then explained specific laws that would help the people subordinate every area of their lives to Yahweh.

Certain trees were considered to be sacred and symbolized fertility, a dominant theme in Canaanite religion. <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:3'>12:3</a> <b>their altars … pillars … graven images.</b> These were elements of Canaanite worship, which included human sacrifice (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:31'>31</a> ).

The tabernacle, Yahweh’s dwelling place, was located in Canaan, where Yahweh chose to dwell. The central importance of the tabernacle was in direct contrast to the multiple places (see v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:2'>2</a> ) where the Canaanites practiced their worship of idols. Eventually, the tabernacle was brought to Jerusalem by David (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 6:12–19'>2Sa 6:12–19</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:6'>12:6</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Le 1-7'>Lv 1–7</a></i> for descriptions of these various ceremonies. <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:7'>12:7</a> <b>eat … be glad.</b> Some of the offerings were shared by the priests, Levites, and the worshipers (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 7:15–18'>Lv 7:15–18</a> ).

The poor were given whatever was necessary to meet their needs, even with the realization that such “loans” would never need to be paid back. <i>See note on <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:19–20'>23:19–20</a> .</i> <a ref='Deuteronomy 15:11'>15:11</a> <b>For the poor will never cease</b> to be <b>in the land.</b> Realistically (in contrast to v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 15:4'>4</a> ), the disobedience toward Yahweh on Israel’s part meant that there would always be poor people in the land of Israel. Jesus repeated this truism in <a ref='Matthew 26:11'>Mt 26:11</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 15:12'>15:12</a> <b>If your brother … is sold.</b> In the context of vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 15:1–11'>1–11</a> , the reason for the sale would be default, an alternative repayment of a debt, and a period of servitude would substitute for that repayment. The Hebrew slave would serve his master 6 years following the sale with freedom being declared in the seventh year. <a ref='Deuteronomy 15:13'>15:13</a> <b>you shall not let him go empty-handed.</b> When a slave had completed his time of service, his former owner was to make ample provision for him so that he would not begin his state of new freedom in destitution. <a ref='Deuteronomy 15:15'>15:15</a> <b>remember.</b> The Israelites, formerly enslaved in Egypt, were to treat their own slaves as God had treated them. <a ref='Deuteronomy 15:17'>15:17</a> <b>an awl … through his ear.</b> In certain circumstances, a slave might prefer to remain with the family after the required 6 years of servitude.

It was to be consecrated to Yahweh. The firstborn would be sacrificed annually, and the offerers would participate in the sacrificial meal (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 14:23'>14:23</a> ). <b>nor shear.</b> The firstborn ox or bull was not to be worked, nor the firstborn sheep or goat shorn in the time before their sacrifice to Yahweh. <a ref='Deuteronomy 15:21'>15:21</a> <b>any defect.</b> An imperfect firstborn animal was not acceptable as a sacrifice. It was to be treated like any other nonsacrificial animal (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:15–16'>12:15–16</a> ) and eaten at home (cf. <a ref='Malachi 1:6–14'>Mal 1:6–14</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:1–17'>16:1–17</a> Moses discusses the feasts during which all the men over 20 years of age were to appear before Yahweh at the central worship site. If possible, their families were to go as well (see vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:14'>14</a> ).

Therefore, sacrifices from both the flock and the herd were used in keeping the Passover. <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:3'>16:3</a> <b>remember.</b> This was the key word at Passover time as it is for the Lord’s Supper today (cf. <a ref='Matthew 26:26–30'>Mt 26:26–30</a> ; <a ref='Luke 22:14–19'>Lk 22:14–19</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 11:23–26'>1Co 11:23–26</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:5–6'>16:5–6</a> <b>at the place … God chooses.</b> The Passover sacrifices could no longer be slain by every family in their house (see <a ref='Exodus 12:46'>Ex 12:46</a> ).

It was also called the “Feast of the Harvest” ( <a ref='Exodus 23:16'>Ex 23:16</a> ) or the “day of the first fruits” ( <a ref='Leviticus 23:9–22'>Lv 23:9–22</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 28:26–31'>Nu 28:26–31</a> ) and later came to be known as “Pentecost” ( <a ref='Acts 2:1'>Ac 2:1</a> ). With the grain harvest completed, this one-day festival was a time of rejoicing. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit, 50 days after the death of Christ at the Passover, was on Pentecost and gives special meaning to that day for Christians (cf. <a ref='Joel 2:28–32'>Joel 2:28–32</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:14–18'>Ac 2:14–18</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:13–15'>16:13–15</a> <b>the Feast of Booths.</b> This was also called the “Feast of Ingathering” and the “Feast of Tabernacles” (cf. <a ref='Exodus 23:16'>Ex 23:16</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 34:22'>34:22</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 23:33–43'>Lv 23:33–43</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 29:12–39'>Nu 29:12–39</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:18–18:22'>16:18—18:22</a> This section deals with the responsibilities of the officials who were to maintain pure worship within the land and to administer justice impartially. <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:18'>16:18</a> <b>appoint … judges and officers.</b> Moses had appointed leaders at Sinai to help him in the administration of the people ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:13'>1:13</a> ). Here he specified that such important leadership should continue in each city. “Judges” were those who adjudicated cases with the application of the law. “Officers” were subordinate leaders of various kinds. <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:19'>16:19</a> <b>a bribe blinds the eyes.</b> Accepting a bribe was wrong since it perverted the ability of judges to act in fairness to the parties in litigation. <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:21–22'>16:21–22</a> <b>Asherah …</b> sacred <b>pillar.</b> Asherah was the name of a Canaanite goddess, represented by a wooden pole, image or tree. A stone pillar symbolic of male fertility was prevalent in the Canaanite religion. These were forbidden by the first two commandments ( <a ref='Exodus 20:3–6'>Ex 20:3–6</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:7–10'>Dt 5:7–10</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:1'>17:1</a> <b>any blemish.</b> To bring a defective sacrifice to Yahweh was to bring something into the sanctuary that was forbidden. Such a sacrifice was an abomination to Yahweh. To offer less than the best to God was to despise His name (see <a ref='Malachi 1:6–8'>Mal 1:6–8</a> ). Offering a less than perfect sacrifice was, in effect, failing to acknowledge God as the ultimate provider of all that was best in life. <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:3–7'>17:3–7</a> <b>served other gods.</b> The local judges were to see that false worshipers were executed, so that idolatry was dealt with severely. <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:6–7'>17:6–7</a> <b>two … or three witnesses.</b> The execution of the idolater could not take place on the basis of hearsay. There had to be at least two valid witnesses against the accused person in order for a case to be established. One witness was not sufficient in a case of this severity; this standard avoided false testimony. The way in which the execution was carried out emphasized the burden of responsibility for truthful testimony that rested on the witnesses in a case involving capital punishment. The witnesses, by casting the first stone, accepted responsibility for their testimony (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:15'>19:15</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 5:13'>1Co 5:13</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:8–13'>17:8–13</a> <b>any case … too difficult for you to judge.</b> If a judge thought a case was too difficult for him to decide, he could take it to a central tribunal, consisting of priests and an officiating chief judge, to be established at the future site of the central sanctuary. The decision of that tribunal would be final, and anyone refusing to abide by that court’s decision was subject to the death penalty. <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:14'>17:14</a> <b>a king.</b> The office of kingship was anticipated by Moses in the Pentateuch (see <a ref='Genesis 17:16'>Ge 17:16</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 35:11'>35:11</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 49:9–12'>49:9–12</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 24:7'>Nu 24:7</a> , <a ref='Numbers 24:17'>17</a> ). He anticipated the time when the people would ask for a king and here gave explicit instruction concerning the qualifications of that future king. <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:15'>17:15</a> <b>from among your brothers.</b> How Yahweh would make that choice was not said, but the field was narrowed by the specification that he must be a brother Israelite. <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:16–17'>17:16–17</a> <b>multiply … multiply … multiply.</b> Restrictions were placed on the king: 1) he must not acquire many horses; 2) he must not take multiple wives; and 3) he must not accumulate much silver and gold. The king was not to rely on military strength, political alliances, or wealth for his position and authority, but he was to look to Yahweh. Solomon violated all of those prohibitions, while his father, David, violated the last two. Solomon’s wives brought idolatry into Jerusalem, which resulted in the kingdom being divided ( <a ref='1 Kings 11:1–43'>1Ki 11:1–43</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:18'>17:18</a> <b>write. … copy of this law.</b> The ideal set forth was that of the king who was obedient to the will of God, which he learned from reading the law. The result of his reading of the Pentateuch would be fear of Yahweh and humility. The king was pictured as a scribe and scholar of Scripture. Josiah reinstituted this approach at a bleak time in Israel’s history (cf. <a ref='2Ki 22'>2Ki 22</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:20'>17:20</a> <b>his heart may not be lifted up above his brothers.</b> The king was not to be above God’s law, any more than any other Israelite. <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:1'>18:1</a> <b>the whole tribe of Levi.</b> Unlike the other 12 tribes, none of the tribe of Levi, including the priests, was given an allotment of land to settle and cultivate. The Levites lived in the cities assigned to them throughout the land ( <a ref='Numbers 35:1–8'>Nu 35:1–8</a> ; <a ref='Jos 21'>Jos 21</a> ) while the priests lived near the central sanctuary, where they went to officiate in their appropriate course (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:57–60'>1Chr 6:57–60</a> ). Levites assisted the priests ( <a ref='Nu 3-4'>Nu 3–4</a> , <a ref='Nu 8'>8</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:3–5'>18:3–5</a> legal <b>judgment for the priests.</b> In place of a land inheritance and in recognition of their priestly duties, the priests had a right to specific portions of the animals offered for sacrifices. <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:6–8'>18:6–8</a> <b>a Levite.</b> If a Levite wanted to go to the central sanctuary to minister there in Yahweh’s name, he was permitted to do so and to receive equal support along with other Levites. <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:9–12'>18:9–12</a> <b>the abominations of those nations.</b> Moses gave a strict injunction not to copy, imitate, or do what the polytheistic Canaanites did. Nine detestable practices of the Canaanites were delineated in vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:10–11'>10–11</a> , namely: 1) sacrificing children in the fire (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:31'>12:31</a> ); 2) witchcraft, seeking to determine the will of the gods by examining and interpreting omens; 3) soothsaying, attempting to control the future through power given by evil spirits; 4) interpreting omens, telling the future based on signs; 5) sorcery, inducing magical effects by drugs or some other sort of potion; 6) conjuring spells, binding other people by magical muttering; 7) being a medium, one who supposedly communicates with the dead, but actually communicates with demons; 8) being a spiritist, one who has an intimate acquaintance with the demonic, spiritual world; and 9) calling up the dead, investigating and seeking information from the dead. These evil practices were the reason Yahweh was going to drive the Canaanites out of the land. <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:15–19'>18:15–19</a> <b>a prophet like me.</b> The singular pronoun emphasizes the ultimate Prophet who was to come. Both the OT ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:10'>34:10</a> ) and the NT ( <a ref='Acts 3:22–23'>Ac 3:22–23</a> ; <a ref='Acts 7:37'>7:37</a> ) interpret this passage as a reference to the coming Messiah, who like Moses would receive and preach divine revelation and lead His people (cf. <a ref='John 1:21'>Jn 1:21</a> , <a ref='John 1:25'>25</a> , <a ref='John 1:43–45'>43–45</a> ; <a ref='John 6:14'>6:14</a> ; <a ref='John 7:40'>7:40</a> ). In fact, Jesus was like Moses in several other ways: 1) He was spared death as a baby ( <a ref='Ex 2'>Ex 2</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 2:13–23'>Mt 2:13–23</a> ); 2) He renounced a royal court ( <a ref='Philippians 2:5–8'>Php 2:5–8</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 11:24–27'>Heb 11:24–27</a> ); 3) He had compassion on His people ( <a ref='Numbers 27:17'>Nu 27:17</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 9:36'>Mt 9:36</a> ); 4) He made intercession for the people ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 9:18'>Dt 9:18</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 7:25'>Heb 7:25</a> ); 5) He spoke with God face to face ( <a ref='Exodus 34:29–30'>Ex 34:29–30</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 3:7'>2Co 3:7</a> ); and 6) He was the mediator of a covenant ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:1'>Dt 29:1</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 8:6–7'>Heb 8:6–7</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:20–22'>18:20–22</a> <b>he speaks in the name of other gods.</b> In contrast to the true prophet, Moses predicted there would be false prophets who would come to Israel, speaking not in the name of Yahweh, but in the name of false gods. How could the people tell if a prophet was authentically speaking for God? Moses said, “if the thing does not come about,” it was not from God. The characteristic of false prophets is the failure of their predictions to always come true. Sometimes false prophets speak and it happens as they said, but they are representing false gods and trying to turn people from the true God—they must be rejected and executed ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 13:1–5'>13:1–5</a> ). Other times, false prophets are more subtle and identify with the true God but speak lies. If ever a prophecy of such a prophet fails, he is shown to be false. Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 28:15–17'>Jer 28:15–17</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 29:30–32'>29:30–32</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:1–23:14'>19:1—23:14</a> The statutes explained by Moses in this part of Deuteronomy deal broadly with social and community order. These laws focus on interpersonal relationships. <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:1–13'>19:1–13</a> See <a ref='Numbers 35:9–34'>Nu 35:9–34</a> for the purpose of the cities of refuge. <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:2'>19:2</a> <b>three cities.</b> Three cities of refuge were to be set aside in Canaan after the conquest of the land (see <a ref='Joshua 20:7'>Jos 20:7</a> for Israel’s obedience to this command). These 3 cities to the west of the Jordan River were in addition to the 3 already established east of it (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:41–43'>4:41–43</a> for the eastern cities of refuge). <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:9'>19:9</a> <b>add three more cities.</b> If the Israelites had been faithful in following Yahweh fully, then He would have enlarged their territory to the boundaries promised in the Abrahamic Covenant ( <a ref='Genesis 15:18–21'>Ge 15:18–21</a> ). In that case, 3 more cities of refuge, for a total of 9, would have been needed. <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:14'>19:14</a> <b>your neighbor’s boundary mark.</b> These “boundary marks” referred to stones bearing inscriptions which identified the owner of the property. Moving a neighbor’s boundary stone was equivalent to stealing his property (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 22:28'>Pr 22:28</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 23:10'>23:10</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:15'>19:15</a> <b>at the mouth of two or three witnesses.</b> More than one witness was necessary to convict a man of a crime. This principle was to act as a safeguard against the false witness who might bring an untruthful charge against a fellow Israelite. By requiring more than one witness, greater accuracy and objectivity was gained (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:6'>Dt 17:6</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 18:15–17'>Mt 18:15–17</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 13:1'>2Co 13:1</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:16–19'>19:16–19</a> <b>a malicious witness.</b> In some cases, there would only be one witness who brought a charge against someone. When such a case was taken to the central tribunal of priests and judges for trial, and upon investigation the testimony of the witness was found to be false, the accuser received the punishment appropriate for the alleged crime. <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:20'>19:20</a> <b>hear and be afraid.</b> When the fate of the false witness became known in Israel, it would serve as a deterrent against giving false testimony in Israel’s courts. <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:21'>19:21</a> <b>eye for eye.</b> This principle of legal justice (called <i>lex talionis</i> , “law of retaliation”) was given to encourage appropriate punishment of a criminal in cases where there might be a tendency to be either too lenient or too strict ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Exodus 21:23–24'>Ex 21:23–24</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 24:20'>Lv 24:20</a></i> ). Jesus confronted the Jews of His day for taking this law out of the courts and using it for purposes of personal vengeance (cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:38–42'>Mt 5:38–42</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:1–20'>20:1–20</a> The humanitarian principles applicable in war under Mosaic law are in stark contrast to the brutality and cruelty of other nations. <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:1'>20:1</a> <b>do not be afraid.</b> When Israelites went into battle, they were never to fear an enemy’s horses or chariots because the outcome of a battle would never be determined by mere military strength. The command not to be afraid was based on God’s power and faithfulness, which had already been proved to Israel in their deliverance from Egypt. <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:2–4'>20:2–4</a> <b>the priest shall … speak to the people.</b> The role of the priest in battle was to encourage the soldiers by God’s promise, presence, and power to be strong in faith. A lack of trust in God’s ability to fight for them would affect the strength of their will so that they would become fainthearted. Victory was linked to their faith in God. <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:5–8'>20:5–8</a> <b>Let him go and return to his house.</b> Four exemptions from service in Israel’s volunteer army were cited to illustrate the principle that anyone whose heart was not in the fight should not be there. Those who had other matters on their minds or were afraid were allowed to leave the army and return to their homes, since they would be useless in battle and even influence others to lose courage (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:8'>8</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:10–15'>20:10–15</a> terms <b>of peace.</b> Cities outside of Canaan were not under the judgment of total destruction, so to them Israel was to offer a peace treaty. If the city agreed to become a vassal to Israel, then the people would become tributary subjects. However, if the offer of peace was rejected, Israel was to besiege and take the city, killing the men and taking possession of the rest of the people and animals as spoils of war. Note here the principle that the proclamation of peace preceded judgment (cf. <a ref='Matthew 10:11–15'>Mt 10:11–15</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:16–18'>20:16–18</a> <b>devote … to destruction.</b> The Canaanite cities were to be totally destroyed, i.e., nothing was to be spared, in order to destroy their influence toward idolatry (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:22–26'>7:22–26</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:19–20'>20:19–20</a> <b>you shall not destroy its trees.</b> When besieging a city, armies in the ancient world would cut down the trees to build ramps and weapons, as well as facilities for the long siege. However, Israel was not to use fruit trees in the siege of a city so they could enjoy the fruit of the land God had given to them ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:12–13'>7:12–13</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 21:1–9'>21:1–9</a> <b>it is not known who has struck him.</b> This law, which dealt with an unsolved homicide, was not given elsewhere in the Pentateuch. In the event that the guilty party was unknown, justice could not adequately be served. However, the people were still held responsible to deal with the crime. The elders of the city closest to the place where the body of a dead man was found were to accept responsibility for the crime. This precluded inter-city strife, in case relatives sought revenge. They would go to a valley (idol altars were always on high places, so this avoided association with idolatry) and there break the neck of a heifer, indicating that the crime deserved to be punished. But the handwashing of the elders (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 21:6'>6</a> ) would show that, although they accepted responsibility for what had happened, they were nevertheless free from the guilt attached to the crime. <a ref='Deuteronomy 21:5'>21:5</a> This distinctly indicates that final judicial authority in the theocracy of Israel rested with the priests. <a ref='Deuteronomy 21:11–14'>21:11–14</a> <b>a beautiful woman.</b> According to ancient war customs, a female captive became the servant of the victors. Moses was given instruction to deal in a kind way with such issues. In the event her conquerors were captivated by her beauty and contemplated marriage with her, one month was required to elapse, during which her troubled feelings might settle, her mind would be reconciled to the new conditions of conquest, and she could sorrow over the loss of her parents as she left home to marry a stranger. One month was the usual mourning period for Jews, and the features of this period, e.g., shaving the head, trimming the nails, and removing her lovely clothes (ladies on the eve of captivity dressed to be attractive to their captors), were typical signs of Jewish grief. This action was important to show kindness to the woman and to test the strength of the man’s affection. After the 30 days, they could marry. If later he decided divorce was appropriate (based on the provisions of <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:1–4'>24:1–4</a> ), he could not sell her as a slave. She was to be set completely free because “you have humbled her.” This phrase clearly refers to sexual activity, in which the wife has fully submitted herself to her husband (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:23–24'>22:23–24</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:28–29'>28–29</a> ). It should be noted that divorce appears to have been common among the people, perhaps learned from their time in Egypt, and tolerated by Moses because of their “hard hearts” ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:1–4'>Dt 24:1–4</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 19:8'>Mt 19:8</a></i> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 21:11–12'>21:11–12</a> <b>among the captives a beautiful woman.</b> Such a woman would be from a non-Canaanite city that Israel had captured (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:14'>20:14</a> ) since all the Canaanites were to be killed ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:16'>20:16</a> ). These discarded items were symbolic of the casting off of her former life and carried purification symbolism (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 14:18'>Lv 14:18</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 8:7'>Nu 8:7</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 21:15–17'>21:15–17</a> <b>has two wives.</b> In the original, the words are rendered “has had two wives,” referring to events that have already taken place, evidently intimating that one wife is dead and another has taken her place. Moses, then, is not legislating on a polygamous case where a man has two wives at the same time, but on that of a man who has married twice in succession. The man may prefer the second wife and be exhorted by her to give his inheritance to one of her sons. The issue involves the principle of the inheritance of the firstborn (the right of primogeniture). The firstborn son of the man, whether from the favorite wife or not, was to receive the double portion of the inheritance. The father did not have the authority to transfer this right to another son. This did not apply to sons of a concubine ( <a ref='Genesis 21:9–13'>Ge 21:9–13</a> ) or in cases of misconduct ( <a ref='Genesis 49:3–4'>Ge 49:3–4</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 21:18–21'>21:18–21</a> <b>a stubborn and rebellious son.</b> Cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:16'>27:16</a> . The long-term pattern of rebellion and sin of a child who was incorrigibly disobedient is in view. No hope remained for such a person who flagrantly violated the fifth commandment ( <a ref='Exodus 20:12'>Ex 20:12</a> ), so he was to be stoned to death. <a ref='Deuteronomy 21:22–23'>21:22–23</a> <b>hang him on a tree.</b> After an execution, the body was permitted to hang on a tree for the rest of the day as a public display of the consequences of disobedience. However, the body was not to remain on the tree overnight, but was to be properly buried before sunset.

In this section, the law of loving one’s neighbor is applied to domestic and social relationships. <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:1–4'>22:1–4</a> <b>ignore.</b> The Israelite must not hide his eyes from such an obvious loss. It was his duty to pursue and bring back the lost property of his neighbor. <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:5'>22:5</a> <b>nor shall a man put on a woman’s clothing.</b> Found only here in the Pentateuch, this statute prohibited a man from wearing any item of feminine clothing or ornamentation, or a woman from wearing any item of masculine clothing or ornamentation. The same word translated “abomination” was used to describe God’s view of homosexuality ( <a ref='Leviticus 18:22'>Lv 18:22</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 20:13'>20:13</a> ). This instance specifically outlawed transvestism. The creation order distinctions between male and female were to be maintained without exception (cf. <a ref='Genesis 1:27'>Ge 1:27</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:6'>22:6</a> <b>a bird’s nest.</b> Found only here in the Pentateuch, this law showed that God cared for the long-term provisions for His people. By letting the mother go, food could be acquired without killing the source of future food. <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:8'>22:8</a> <b>a parapet.</b> Found only here in the Pentateuch, this refers to the roof of a home in ancient Israel, which was flat and usually reached by outside stairs. To prevent injury or death from falling, a fence was to be built around the roof. This, too, expressed love for those who might otherwise be injured or killed. <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:9'>22:9</a> <b>two kinds of seed.</b> The aim of the legislation seems to be to maintain healthy crops by keeping the seeds separate from one another. <i>See note on <a ref='Leviticus 19:19'>Lv 19:19</a> .</i> <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:10'>22:10</a> <b>an ox and a donkey together.</b> According to the dietary laws prescribed earlier ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 14:1–8'>14:1–8</a> ), the ox was a “clean” animal, but the donkey was “unclean.” Even more compelling was the fact that these two different animals couldn’t together plow a straight furrow. Their temperaments, natural instincts, and physical characteristics made it impossible. As with the seed (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:9'>9</a> ), God is protecting His people’s food. <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:11'>22:11</a> <b>material … wool and flax.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Leviticus 19:19'>Lv 19:19</a> .</i> <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:12'>22:12</a> <b>make … tassels.</b> See <a ref='Numbers 15:38–40'>Nu 15:38–40</a> for the purpose of these tassels. <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:13–30'>22:13–30</a> This section is on family life (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 18:1–30'>Lv 18:1–30</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 20:10–21'>20:10–21</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:13–21'>22:13–21</a> An Israelite who doubted the virginity of his bride was to make a formal accusation to the “elders of the city.” If her parents gave proof of virginity showing the accusation was false, the husband was to pay a penalty and was prohibited from divorcing the woman. However, if she was found not to be a virgin, then she was to be put to death. <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:15'>22:15</a> <b>the</b> evidence <b>of the girl’s virginity.</b> Probably a blood-stained garment or a bed sheet from the wedding night. <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:19'>22:19</a> shekels. This word is not in the Hebrew text, but the context suggests it. A shekel weighed .4 oz., so the total fine would be about 2.5 lbs. of silver. <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:22–29'>22:22–29</a> Adultery was punished by death for the two found in the act. If the adulterous persons were a man with a woman who was pledged to be married to someone else, this consensual act led to the death of both parties (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:23–24'>23–24</a> ). However, if the man forced (i.e., raped) the woman, then only the man’s life was required (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:25–27'>25–27</a> ). If the woman was a virgin not pledged in marriage, then the man had to pay a fine, marry the girl, and keep her as his wife as long as he lived (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:28–29'>28–29</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:30'>22:30</a> <b>A man shall not take his father’s wife.</b> In no case was a man to marry his father’s wife or have sexual relations with her. This probably has relations with a stepmother in view, though incest was certainly forbidden (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 18:6–8'>Lv 18:6–8</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:1'>23:1</a> <b>the assembly of Yahweh.</b> From the sanctification of the home and marriage in the previous chapter, Moses proceeds to the sanctification of their union as a congregation and speaks of the right of citizenship, including being gathered before the presence of Yahweh to worship Him. Most likely, this law did not exclude one from residence in the area where Israel was to live, but from public offices and honors, intermarriage, and participation in the religious rites at the tabernacle plus later at the temple. The emasculated (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:1'>1</a> ), the illegitimate (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:2'>2</a> ), and the Ammonites and Moabites (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:3–6'>3–6</a> ) were not allowed to worship Yahweh. The general rule was that strangers and foreigners, for fear of friendship or marriage connections which would lead Israel into idolatry, were not admissible until their conversion to God and the Jewish faith. This purge, however, describes some limitations to the general rule. Eunuchs, illegitimate children, and people from Ammon and Moab were excluded. Eunuchs were forbidden because such willful mutilation (lit. in Hebrew, by crushing, which was the way such an act was generally performed) violated God’s creation of man, was associated with idolatrous practices, and was done by pagan parents to their children so that they might serve as eunuchs in the homes of the great (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:11–12'>25:11–12</a> ). The illegitimate were excluded so as to place an indelible stigma as a discouragement to shameful sexual misconduct. People from Ammon and Moab were excluded, not because they were born out of incest (cf. <a ref='Genesis 19:30'>Ge 19:30ff.</a> ), but on account of their vicious hostility toward God and His people Israel. Many of the Israelites were settled east of the Jordan in the immediate neighborhood of these people, so God raised this wall to prevent the evils of idolatrous influence. Individuals from all 3 of these outcast groups are offered grace and acceptance by Isaiah upon personal faith in the true God (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 56:1–8'>Is 56:1–8</a> ). Ruth the Moabitess serves as a most notable example (cf. <a ref='Ruth 1:4'>Ru 1:4</a> , <a ref='Ruth 1:16'>16</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:2–3'>23:2–3</a> <b>to the tenth generation.</b> The use of the words “shall ever” and “never” in vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:3'>3</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:6'>6</a> seems to indicate that this phrase is an idiom denoting permanent exclusion from the worshiping community of Israel. In contrast, an Edomite or Egyptian might worship in Israel in the third generation (see vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:7–8'>7–8</a> ). Though these nations had also been enemies, Edom was a near relative, coming from Jacob’s family, while individual Egyptians had shown kindness to the Israelites at the Exodus (cf. <a ref='Exodus 12:36'>Ex 12:36</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:9–14'>23:9–14</a> Because the camp of Israelite soldiers was a place of God’s presence (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:14'>14</a> ), the camp was to be kept clean. Instruction was given concerning nocturnal emission (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:10–11'>10–11</a> ) and defecation (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:12–13'>12–13</a> ). Such instruction for external cleanness illustrated what God wanted in the heart. <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:15–25:19'>23:15—25:19</a> Moses selected 21 sample laws to further illustrate the nature of the requirements of living under the Sinaitic Covenant. <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:15–16'>23:15–16</a> A fugitive slave was not to be turned over to his master. Evidently this has in mind a slave from the Canaanites or other neighboring nations who was driven out by oppression or with a desire to know Israel’s God. <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:17–18'>23:17–18</a> Prostitution as a form of worship was forbidden. “Dog” was a reference to male prostitutes (cf. <a ref='Revelation 22:15'>Rev 22:15</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:19–20'>23:19–20</a> This prohibition of lending money at interest to a fellow Israelite is qualified by <a ref='Exodus 22:25'>Ex 22:25</a> and <a ref='Leviticus 25:35–36'>Lv 25:35–36</a> , which indicates that it restricts its application to the poor and prevents further impoverishment, but it was allowed for foreigners who were engaged in trade and commerce to enlarge their wealth. According to <a ref='Deuteronomy 15:1–2'>Dt 15:1–2</a> , it is also clear that money could be legitimately lent in the normal course of business, subject to forgiveness of all unpaid debt in the sabbatical year (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:10'>24:10</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:21–23'>23:21–23</a> Though vows were made voluntarily, they were to be promptly kept once made. Cf. <a ref='Numbers 30:2'>Nu 30:2</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:24–25'>23:24–25</a> Farmers were to share their produce with the people in the land, but the people were not to profit from the farmers’ generosity. <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:1–4'>24:1–4</a> This passage does not command, commend, condone, or even suggest divorce. Rather, it recognizes that divorce occurs and permits it only on restricted grounds. The case presented here is designed to convey the fact that divorcing produced defilement. Notice the following sequence: 1) if a man finds an uncleanness (some impurity or something vile, cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:14'>23:14</a> ) in his wife, other than adultery, which was punished by execution (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:22'>22:22</a> ); 2) if he legally divorces her (although God hates divorce, as <a ref='Malachi 2:16'>Mal 2:16</a> says; He has designed marriage for life, as <a ref='Genesis 2:24'>Ge 2:24</a> declares; and He allowed divorce because of hard hearts, as <a ref='Matthew 19:8'>Mt 19:8</a> reveals); 3) if she then marries another man; 4) if the new husband then dies or divorces her; then that woman could not return to her first husband (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:4'>4</a> ). This is so because she was “defiled” with such a defilement that is an abomination to Yahweh and a sinful pollution of the Promised Land. What constitutes that defilement? Only one thing is possible—she was defiled in the remarriage because there was no ground for the divorce. So when she remarried, she became an adulteress ( <a ref='Matthew 5:31–32'>Mt 5:31–32</a> ) and is thus defiled so that her former husband can’t take her back. Illegitimate divorce proliferates adultery. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 5:31–32'>Mt 5:31–32</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 19:4–9'>19:4–9</a> .</i> <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:5'>24:5</a> During the first year of marriage, a man was not held responsible for military service or any other duty. He was to devote that year of marriage to the enjoyment and establishment of his marriage. <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:6'>24:6</a> Two millstones were needed to grind grain. Neither was to be taken in pledge because it was indispensable to one’s daily subsistence. <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:7'>24:7</a> The death penalty would be exacted on kidnappers who kidnapped a brother Israelite for involuntary servitude or as merchandise to sell. <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:8–9'>24:8–9</a> Moses exhorted the people to follow the commands of Yahweh regarding infectious skin diseases ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Leviticus 13:1–14:57'>Lv 13:1—14:57</a></i> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:10–13'>24:10–13</a> <b>his deposit.</b> This would often be a cloak, an outer garment, which was given in pledge to guarantee the repayment of a loan. God’s people were to act righteously in the lending of money. An example of a righteous lender was one who did not forcefully exact payment and who allowed a poor person to retain his pledge (cloak) overnight if it was necessary to keep him warm. Lending to the poor was permitted, but without 1) interest ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:19–20'>23:19–20</a> ); 2) coercion to repay; and 3) extension of the loan beyond the sabbatical year ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 15:1–2'>15:1–2</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:14–15'>24:14–15</a> Day laborers were to be paid on the day they labored because they lived day to day on such wages (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 19:13'>Lv 19:13</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 20:1–16'>Mt 20:1–16</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:16'>24:16</a> Punishment for a crime was to be borne only by the offender. <i>See notes on <a ref='Eze 18'>Eze 18</a> .</i> The death of Saul’s 7 grandsons ( <a ref='2 Samuel 21:5–9'>2Sa 21:5–9</a> ) is a striking exception of national proportion grounded in God’s sovereign wisdom, as was the death of David and Bathsheba’s first son ( <a ref='2 Samuel 12:14'>2Sa 12:14</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:17–18'>24:17–18</a> The administration of law should be carried out with equity for all members of society, including those with the least power and influence, e.g., widows, orphans, and immigrants. <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:19–22'>24:19–22</a> The practice of allowing the needy to glean in the field was grounded in the remembrance of Israel’s hard service in Egypt (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:18'>18</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:1–3'>25:1–3</a> Corporal punishment for crimes committed was to be equitably carried out in the presence of the judges and was limited to 40 stripes. <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:4'>25:4</a> A worker must be allowed to enjoy the fruit of his own labor (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 9:9'>1Co 9:9</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 5:18'>1Ti 5:18</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 2:6'>2Ti 2:6</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:5–10'>25:5–10</a> Levirate marriages (from Latin, <i>levir</i> , “husband’s brother”) provided that the brother of a dead man who died childless was to marry the widow in order to provide an heir. These were not compulsory marriages in Israel, but were applied as strong options to brothers who shared the same estate. Obviously, this required that the brother be unmarried and desired to keep the property in the family by passing it on to a son. Cf. <a ref='Leviticus 18:16'>Lv 18:16</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 20:21'>20:21</a> where adultery with a living brother’s wife is forbidden. Though not compulsory, this practice reflected fraternal affection, and if a single brother refused to conform to this practice, he was confronted with contempt and humiliation by the elders. The perpetuation of his name as a member of the covenant people witnessed to the dignity of the individual. Since <a ref='Numbers 27:4–8'>Nu 27:4–8</a> gave daughters the right of inheritance when there were no sons in a family, it is reasonable to read “no child” rather than “no son” in v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:5'>5</a> . Cf. Tamar, <a ref='Genesis 38:8–10'>Ge 38:8–10</a> , and the Boaz-Ruth marriage, <a ref='Ruth 4:1–17'>Ru 4:1–17</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:5'>25:5</a> Cf. <a ref='Matthew 22:24'>Mt 22:24</a> ; <a ref='Mark 12:19'>Mk 12:19</a> ; <a ref='Luke 20:28'>Lk 20:28</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:11–12'>25:11–12</a> The consequence of the immodest act was the only example of punishment by mutilation in the Pentateuch. <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:13–16'>25:13–16</a> The weights and measures of trade were to be kept equitably so people were not cheated. Obedience meant prosperous years in the land. <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:17–19'>25:17–19</a> The admonition to remember the treachery of the Amalekites was repeated to the new generation ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Exodus 17:9–16'>Ex 17:9–16</a></i> ). For execution of the command, see <a ref='1Sa 15'>1Sa 15</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:1–15'>26:1–15</a> As the stipulation section of Deuteronomy came to an end (chaps. <a ref='De 5-25'>5–25</a> ), Moses commanded the people to keep two rituals when they had conquered the land and began to enjoy its produce. These two rituals were the initial first fruits offering ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:1–11'>26:1–11</a> ) and the first third-year special tithe ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:12–15'>26:12–15</a> ). In both cases, there is an emphasis upon the prayer of confession to be given at the time of the rituals ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:5–10'>26:5–10</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:13–15'>13–15</a> ). These special offerings were given in order to celebrate Israel’s transition from a nomadic existence to a settled agrarian community, made possible by Yahweh’s blessing. <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:2'>26:2</a> <b>the first of all the fruit.</b> Baskets of the first fruits of the first harvest reaped by Israel once they were in the land of Canaan were to be taken to the tabernacle (cf. <a ref='Exodus 23:19'>Ex 23:19</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 34:26'>34:26</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 18:12–17'>Nu 18:12–17</a> ). This is to be distinguished from the annual Feast of First Fruits (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 23:9–14'>Lv 23:9–14</a> ) celebrated in conjunction with the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:5'>26:5</a> <b>you shall … say before Yahweh your God.</b> The offering of the first fruits was to be accompanied by an elaborate confession of Yahweh’s faithfulness in preserving Israel and bringing the people into the land. The essential aspects of the worshiper’s coming to the sanctuary were the presentation of the first fruits, bowing in worship, and rejoicing in Yahweh’s goodness. In this manner the visit to the sanctuary was a confession and acknowledgment of God. It was a time of praise and rejoicing because of God’s goodness and mercy extended to former generations and evidence of divine sustaining grace at that time. <b>a wandering Aramean.</b> This phrase referred to Jacob, who was each Israelite’s father or ancestor. When Jacob fled from his home in Beersheba he passed through Syria (Aram) to Mesopotamia ( <a ref='Genesis 24:10'>Ge 24:10</a> ) to live with Laban his uncle. Returning from there, Jacob was overtaken by Laban after he came through Syria at the Jabbok River, where he not only faced the wrath of Laban but also that of Esau his brother. Later, the famine in Canaan necessitated his migration to Egypt. When the Israelites became populous and powerful, they were oppressed by the Egyptians, but it was God who responded to their prayers and miraculously delivered them out of Egypt. It was God who enabled them to enter and conquer the land from which the first fruits were presented before the altar. <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:12'>26:12</a> <b>the tithe.</b> I.e., the tithe collected every third year of Israel in the land of Canaan (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 14:28'>14:28</a> ). Apparently this tithe was not taken to the central sanctuary, but distributed locally to Levites, immigrants, widows, and orphans. For the other regular annual tithes, <i>see note on <a ref='Deuteronomy 14:22'>14:22</a></i> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:13–14'>26:13–14</a> <b>you shall say before Yahweh your God.</b> The confession to be made in connection with the offering of this first tithe consisted of a statement of obedience (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:13–14'>13–14</a> ) and a prayer for God’s blessing (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:15'>15</a> ). In this manner, the Israelite confessed his continual dependence on God and lived in obedient expectation of God’s continued gracious blessing. <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:15'>26:15</a> <b>Look down from … heaven.</b> This was the first reference to God’s dwelling place being in heaven. From His abode in heaven, God had given the Israelites the land flowing with milk and honey as He had promised to the patriarchs. His continued blessing on both the people and the land was requested. <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:16–19'>26:16–19</a> These 4 verses concluded Moses’ explanation of the law’s stipulations by calling for the total commitment by Israel to Yahweh and His commands. These verses can be viewed as the formal ratification of the Sinaitic Covenant between Yahweh and the second generation of Israel. In accepting the terms of this agreement, acknowledging that Yahweh is their God, and promising wholehearted obedience plus a desire to listen to God’s voice, the Israelites were assured that they were His people and the chosen over all other nations to receive His blessings and the calling to witness to His glory to all the world. See <a ref='Exodus 19:5–6'>Ex 19:5–6</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:16'>26:16</a> <b>This day.</b> I.e., the first day of the 11th month of the 40th year ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:3'>1:3</a> ). Note also, “today” in vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:17–18'>17–18</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:1–28:68'>27:1—28:68</a> In these two chapters, Moses explained the curses and the blessings associated with the Sinaitic Covenant. He first called Israel to perform an elaborate ceremony to ratify the covenant when they entered the land ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:1–26'>27:1–26</a> ; carried out by Joshua in <a ref='Joshua 8:30–35'>Jos 8:30–35</a> ). This was to remind the people that it was essential to obey the covenant and its laws. Then, Moses further explained the blessings for obedience and the curses for disobedience ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:1–68'>28:1–68</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:2'>27:2</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:4'>4</a> <b>coat them with lime.</b> Upon arrival in the Land of Promise, under Joshua, large stone pillars were to be erected. Following the method used in Egypt, they were to be prepared for writing by whitewashing with plaster. When the law was written on the stones, the white background would make it clearly visible and easily read. These inscribed stones were to offer constant testimony to all people and coming generations of their relationship to God and His law (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:26'>31:26</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 24:26–27'>Jos 24:26–27</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:3'>27:3</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:8'>8</a> <b>all the words of this law.</b> Probably a reference to the whole book of Deuteronomy. <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:4'>27:4</a> <b>Mount Ebal.</b> A mountain in the center of the Promised Land, just to the north of the city of Shechem. It was at Shechem that Yahweh first appeared to Abraham in the land and where Abraham built his first altar to Yahweh ( <a ref='Genesis 12:6–7'>Ge 12:6–7</a> ). This mountain, where the stone pillars with the law and the altar (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:5'>5</a> ) were built, was the place where the curses were to be read (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:13'>13</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:5–7'>27:5–7</a> <b>build there an altar.</b> In addition to setting up the stones, the Israelites were to build an altar of uncut stones. On this altar the offerings were to be brought to Yahweh, and together the people would rejoice in God’s presence. This is what was done when the covenantal relationship was established at Mt. Sinai ( <a ref='Exodus 24:1–8'>Ex 24:1–8</a> ). The burnt offerings, completely consumed, represented complete devotion to God; the peace offerings expressed thanks to Him. <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:12–13'>27:12–13</a> <b>these … these.</b> The 12 tribes were divided into two groups of 6 each. The tribe of Levi was to participate in the first group. The tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim were together as the tribe of Joseph. <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:12'>27:12</a> <b>Mount Gerizim.</b> This was the mountain just to the south of Mt. Ebal with the city of Shechem in the valley between, from which the blessings were to be read. Perhaps the actual arrangement provided that the priests stood by the ark of the covenant, in the valley between the two mountains, with 6 tribes located northward toward Mt. Ebal and 6 southward toward Mt. Gerizim. The priests and Levites read the curses and blessings with the people responding with the “Amen” of affirmation. <b>to bless.</b> The blessings that were to be recited from Mt. Gerizim were not recorded in this passage, no doubt omitted here to stress that Israel did not prove themselves obedient to the covenant and, therefore, did not enjoy the blessings. <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:15–26'>27:15–26</a> Twelve offenses serve as examples of the kind of iniquities that made one subject to the curse. These offenses might have been chosen because they are representative of sins that might escape detection and so remain secret (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:15'>15</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:24'>24</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:15'>27:15</a> <b>man who makes. … molten image.</b> The first curse concerned idolatry, the breaking of the first and second commandments ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:7–10'>5:7–10</a> ). <b>Amen.</b> To each curse all the people responded, “Amen.” The word means “so be it.” The people thereby indicated their understanding and agreement with the statement made. <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:16'>27:16</a> <b>dishonors his father or mother.</b> The dishonoring of parents was the breaking of the fifth commandment ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:16'>5:16</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:17'>27:17</a> <b>boundary mark.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:14'>19:14</a> .</i> <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:18'>27:18</a> <b>leads a blind</b> person <b>astray.</b> This refers to abusing a blind man. <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:19'>27:19</a> <b>perverts the justice.</b> The taking advantage of those members of society who could be easily abused. <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:20'>27:20</a> <b>lies with his father’s wife.</b> Incest. <i>See note on <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:30'>22:30</a> .</i> <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:21'>27:21</a> <b>lies with any animal.</b> Bestiality.

Total obedience is demanded by the law and required by God. Only the Lord Jesus Christ accomplished this ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ). <b>Amen.</b> All the people agreed to be obedient (cf. <a ref='Exodus 24:1–8'>Ex 24:1–8</a> ), a promise they would soon violate. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:1–68'>28:1–68</a> In his responsibility as leader and mediator, Moses had previously told the people the promise of God’s blessing and the warning that they should not turn to other gods when the covenant was given at Sinai ( <a ref='Exodus 23:20–33'>Ex 23:20–33</a> ). After their rebellion against that covenant, Moses warned them ( <a ref='Le 26'>Lv 26</a> ) of the divine judgment that would come if they disobeyed. Here, Moses gives an exhortation based upon the blessings and the curses of the covenant (see <a ref='Leviticus 26:1–45'>Lv 26:1–45</a> ). The blessings and the curses in this chapter follow the same structure. First, Moses clearly explained that the quality of Israel’s future experience would come on the basis of obedience or disobedience to God ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:1–2'>28:1–2</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:15'>15</a> ). Second, the actual blessings and curses were succinctly stated ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:3–6'>28:3–6</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:16–19'>16–19</a> ). Third, Moses gave a sermonic elaboration of the basic blessings and curses ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:7–14'>28:7–14</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:20–68'>20–68</a> ). Just as the curses were given more prominence in the ceremony of <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:11–26'>27:11–26</a> , so the curses incurred by disobedience to the covenant were much more fully developed here. The perspective of Moses was that Israel would not prove faithful to the covenant ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:16–18'>31:16–18</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:27'>27</a> ) and so would not enjoy the blessings of the covenant; therefore, the curses received much more attention. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:1–14'>28:1–14</a> See <a ref='Joshua 21:45'>Jos 21:45</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 23:14–15'>23:14–15</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 8:56'>1Ki 8:56</a> for blessing fulfillment. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:1–2'>28:1–2</a> <b>diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God.</b> “Diligently listen” stressed the need for complete obedience on the part of Israel. The people could not legally or personally merit God’s goodness and blessing, but their constant desire to obey, worship, and maintain a right relation to Him was evidence of their true faith in and love for Him (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:5'>6:5</a> ). It was also evidence of God’s gracious work in their hearts. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:1'>28:1</a> <b>high above all the nations.</b> If Israel obeyed Yahweh, ultimate blessing would be given in the form of preeminence above all the nations of the world (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:19'>26:19</a> ). The indispensable condition for obtaining this blessing was salvation, resulting in obedience to Yahweh, in the form of keeping His commandments. This blessing will ultimately come to pass in the millennial kingdom, particularly designed to exalt Israel’s King, the Messiah, and His nation (see <a ref='Zechariah 13:1–14:21'>Zec 13:1—14:21</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:3–6'>28:3–6</a> <b>Blessed.</b> These beatitudes summarize the various spheres where the blessing of God would extend to Israel’s life. God’s favor is also intended to permeate all their endeavors as emphasized further in the expanded summary in <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:7–14'>28:7–14</a> , on the condition of obedience (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:1–2'>1–2</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:13–14'>13–14</a> ). They will know victory, prosperity, purity, respect, abundance, and dominance—comprehensive blessing. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:6'>28:6</a> <b>come in … go out.</b> An idiomatic way of referring to the normal everyday activities of life (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:2'>31:2</a> ). This is a fitting conclusion to the blessings and curses (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:19'>19</a> ) since it sums up everything. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:10'>28:10</a> <b>called by the name of Yahweh.</b> Israel’s obedience and blessing would cause all the people of the earth to fear Israel because they were clearly the people of God. This was God’s intention for them all along, to be a witness to the nations of the one true and living God and draw the Gentiles out of idol worship. They will be that witness nation in the last days (see <a ref='Revelation 7:4–10'>Rev 7:4–10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:1'>14:1</a> ) and in the kingdom (see <a ref='Zechariah 8:1–12'>Zec 8:1–12</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:13'>28:13</a> <b>the head and not the tail.</b> Israel was to be the leader over the other nations (“the head”) and not to be in subjection to another nation (“the tail”). <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:15–68'>28:15–68</a> The curses are outlined as God warned His people of the price of the absence of love for Him and disobedience. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:15'>28:15</a> Cf. <a ref='Joshua 23:15–16'>Jos 23:15–16</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:16–19'>28:16–19</a> These are parallels to the blessings in vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:3–6'>3–6</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:20'>28:20</a> <b>until you are destroyed.</b> Moses was aware that the Israelites were apt to be unfaithful to God, so he portrays in extended warnings the disastrous results of the loss of their land and their place of worship if they disobeyed God. Destruction was the ultimate calamity for Israel’s sin (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:20–21'>20–21</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:24'>24</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:45'>45</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:48'>48</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:51'>51</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:61'>61</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:63'>63</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:21'>28:21</a> Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 14:12'>Jer 14:12</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 21:6'>21:6</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 5:12'>Eze 5:12</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 6:11'>6:11</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:22'>28:22</a> Cf. <a ref='Amos 4:9'>Am 4:9</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:23'>28:23</a> <b>bronze … iron.</b> The heavens would be as bright as bronze, but no rain would fall from them to water the ground. The earth would be as hard as iron, so any rain that would fall would run off and not penetrate (cf. <a ref='Amos 4:7'>Am 4:7</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:25'>28:25</a> Cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 29:8'>2Chr 29:8</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 1:8'>Ne 1:8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 15:4'>Jer 15:4</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:26'>28:26</a> Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 7:33'>Jer 7:33</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 16:4'>16:4</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 19:7'>19:7</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 34:20'>34:20</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:27'>28:27</a> <b>the boils of Egypt.</b> The disease with which God afflicted the Egyptians prior to the Exodus (see <a ref='Exodus 9:9'>Ex 9:9</a> ; <a ref='Amos 4:10'>Am 4:10</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:30'>28:30</a> These 3 curses were in contrast to the exemptions from military service granted in <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:5–7'>20:5–7</a> . The exemptions were possible because God would grant His people victory in battle. Disobedience to Yahweh, however, would mean that God would no longer fight for His people. Those normally exempted from military service would be forced to fight and be killed. Consequently, the soldier’s betrothed wife would be violated and his house and grapes taken by the foreign invader (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 8:10'>Jer 8:10</a> ; <a ref='Amos 5:11'>Am 5:11</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 1:13'>Zep 1:13</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:32'>28:32</a> Cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 29:9'>2Chr 29:9</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:35'>28:35</a> <b>sole of your foot … head.</b> Diseases of the skin would afflict the people cursed by God.

This future nation would be particularly steeped in idolatry (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 17:41'>2Ki 17:41</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 16:13'>Jer 16:13</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:37'>28:37</a> Cf. <a ref='1 Kings 9:8'>1Ki 9:8</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 29:8'>2Chr 29:8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 19:8'>Jer 19:8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 25:9'>25:9</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 25:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 29:18'>29:18</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:38–40'>28:38–40</a> Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 5:10'>Is 5:10</a> ; <a ref='Joel 1:4'>Joel 1:4</a> ; <a ref='Micah 6:15'>Mic 6:15</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:46'>28:46</a> Cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 29:8'>2Chr 29:8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 18:6'>Jer 18:6</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 14:8'>Eze 14:8</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:49'>28:49</a> <b>a nation … from the end of the earth.</b> God would raise up a nation to act as His own instrument of judgment against His ungrateful people. This foreign nation was described as coming from a far distance from Israel, a nation that would arise quickly and one that would completely devastate the land. This was fulfilled first by Assyria ( <a ref='Isaiah 5:26'>Is 5:26</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 7:18–20'>7:18–20</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 28:11'>28:11</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 37:18'>37:18</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 8:1'>Hos 8:1</a> ) and second, by Babylon ( <a ref='Jeremiah 5:15'>Jer 5:15</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 4:19'>Lam 4:19</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 17:3'>Eze 17:3</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 1:6–8'>Hab 1:6–8</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:50'>28:50</a> Cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:17'>2Chr 36:17</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:52–57'>28:52–57</a> Ultimately, an invading nation would besiege all of the cities of Judah ( <i>see note on <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:49'>28:49</a></i> ). In vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:53–57'>53–57</a> , Moses gave a revolting description of the Israelites’ response to those siege conditions. The unthinkable activity of cannibalism is introduced in v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:53'>53</a> and then illustrated in the verses that follow (see <a ref='2 Kings 6:28–29'>2Ki 6:28–29</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 2:20'>Lam 2:20</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 4:10'>4:10</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:52'>28:52</a> Cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 32:10'>2Chr 32:10</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 10:17–18'>Jer 10:17–18</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 5:2'>Eze 5:2</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 11:6'>Hos 11:6</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:53'>28:53</a> Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 19:9'>Jer 19:9</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:58–63'>28:58–63</a> <b>this glorious and fearsome name, Yahweh your God.</b> Israel’s obedience to the law (i.e., the Sinaitic Covenant) would lead to fearing Yahweh, whose “name” represents His presence and character. The title “Yahweh” revealed the glory and greatness of God (see <a ref='Exodus 3:15'>Ex 3:15</a> ). Significantly, the phrase “Yahweh your God” is used approximately 280 times in the book of Deuteronomy. The full measure of the divine curse would come on Israel when its disobedience had been hardened into disregard for the glorious and awesome character of God. In vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:15'>15</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:45'>45</a> Moses described curses for disobedience; hence the worst of the curses come when disobedience is hardened into failure to fear God. Only God’s grace would save a small remnant (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:62'>62</a> ), thus keeping Israel from being annihilated (cf. <a ref='Malachi 2:2'>Mal 2:2</a> ). In contrast to the promise made to Abraham in <a ref='Genesis 15:5'>Ge 15:5</a> , the physical seed of Abraham under God’s curse would be reduced; as God had multiplied the seed of the patriarchs in Egypt (see <a ref='Exodus 1:7'>Ex 1:7</a> ), He would decimate their numbers to make them as nothing until His restoration of the nation in a future day (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:5'>30:5</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:59–61'>28:59–61</a> Cf. <a ref='Amos 4:10'>Am 4:10</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:61'>28:61</a> <b>the book of this law.</b> A definite, particular written document was meant (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:9'>31:9</a> ), referring not just to Deuteronomy (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:9'>31:9</a> ), but to the Pentateuch, as far as it had been written. This is evident from vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:60–61'>60–61</a> , which indicate that the diseases of Egypt were written in the book of the law, thus referring to Exodus, which records those plagues. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:63'>28:63</a> Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 12:14'>Jer 12:14</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 45:4'>45:4</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:64'>28:64</a> <b>Yahweh will scatter you.</b> The Jews remaining after the curses fall would be dispersed by Yahweh ultimately to serve false gods, restlessly and fearfully throughout all the nations of the earth (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 1:8–9'>Ne 1:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 30:11'>Jer 30:11</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 11:16'>Eze 11:16</a> ). This dispersion began with the captivity of the northern kingdom, Israel (722 BC), then the southern kingdom, Judah (586 BC), and is still a reality today. In the future earthly kingdom of Messiah, Israel will experience its regathering in faith, salvation, and righteousness. See <a ref='Isaiah 59:19–21'>Is 59:19–21</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer 31:31–34</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 36:8–37:14'>Eze 36:8—37:14</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–14:21'>Zec 12:10—14:21</a> . The unbearable nature of Israel’s present condition was emphasized since the people longed for another time (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:67'>67</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 44:7'>Jer 44:7</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 8:13'>Hos 8:13</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 9:3'>9:3</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 11:4–5'>11:4–5</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:68'>28:68</a> <b>but there will be no buyer.</b> Israel would be so abandoned by God that she would not even be able to sell herself into slavery. The curse of God would bring Israel into a seemingly hopeless condition (cf. <a ref='Hosea 8:13'>Hos 8:13</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 9:3'>9:3</a> ). The specific mention of Egypt could be symbolic for any lands where the Jews have been taken into bondage or sold as slaves. But it is true that after the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, which was a judgment on the apostasy of Israel and their rejection and execution of the Messiah, this prophecy was actually fulfilled. The Roman general Titus, who conquered Jerusalem and Israel, sent 17,000 adult Jews to Egypt to perform hard labor there and had those who were under 17 years old publicly sold. Under the Roman emperor Hadrian, countless Jews were sold and suffered such bondage and cruelty. <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:1–30:20'>29:1—30:20</a> These chapters contain the third address of Moses, which is a contrast between the covenant at Sinai and the covenant he envisioned for Israel in the future. Though the past had seen Israel’s failure to keep the covenant and to trust in God, there was hope for the future. It was this hope that Moses emphasized in the content of these chapters focusing clearly on the themes of the New Covenant. <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:1'>29:1</a> <b>These are the words.</b> The Hebrew text numbers this verse as 28:69 rather than <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:1'>29:1</a> , seeing it as the conclusion to the second address of Moses. However, as in <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:1'>1:1</a> , these words introduce what follows, serving as the introduction to Moses’ third address. <b>the covenant … in the land of Moab.</b> The majority of interpreters view the covenant stated here as a reference to the covenant made at Sinai. According to this view, the covenant that God made with Israel at Sinai (Horeb) was renewed in Moab. However, this verse clearly states that the covenant of which Moses now speaks was “besides,” or “in addition to,” the previous covenant. This was another covenant distinct from the one made at Sinai. This other covenant is viewed by some interpreters as the Palestinian Covenant, which gave Israel the title to the land (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:5'>30:5</a> ). However, the emphasis of these two chapters is not on the land, but on the change of Israel’s heart (see the contrast between <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:4'>29:4</a> and <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:6'>30:6</a> ). It was exactly this change of heart which the later prophets would term “The New Covenant” (see <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer 31:31–34</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 36:26–27'>Eze 36:26–27</a> ). In response to Israel’s certain failure under the provisions of the Sinaitic Covenant ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:23–28'>29:23–28</a> ), Moses anticipated the New Covenant under which Israel would be obedient to Yahweh and finally reap His blessings ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:1–10'>30:1–10</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:4'>29:4</a> <b>Yahweh has not given you … eyes to see.</b> In spite of all they had experienced (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:2–3'>2–3</a> ), Israel was spiritually blind to the significance of what Yahweh had done for them, lacking spiritual understanding, even as Moses was speaking. This spiritual blindness of Israel continues to the present day ( <a ref='Romans 11:8'>Ro 11:8</a> ), and it will not be reversed until Israel’s future day of salvation (see <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ). Yahweh had not given them an understanding heart, simply because the people had not penitently sought it (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 7:14'>2Chr 7:14</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:9'>29:9</a> <b>keep the words of this covenant.</b> The spiritual experience of God’s faithfulness to Israel should have led to obedience to the stipulations of the Sinaitic Covenant in the future, but could not without a transformed heart (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:4'>4</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:18'>18</a> ) and the true knowledge of God (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:6'>6</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:10–11'>29:10–11</a> <b>You stand … before Yahweh your God.</b> All the people were likely stationed in an orderly way before Moses, but this is not a call to outward order, but inward devotion, to make the covenant a matter of the heart and life. <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:12'>29:12</a> <b>enter into the covenant … and … oath.</b> “Enter into” expresses entire submission in faith and repentance before God, resulting in heart obedience. The people were to bind themselves in an oath to obey the stipulations of God’s covenant (cf. <a ref='Genesis 26:28'>Ge 26:28</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:14–15'>29:14–15</a> <b>not with you alone.</b> All of Israel, present and future, were to be bound by the stipulations of the covenant to obey God and be blessed. Thus they would be able to lead all nations to the blessedness of salvation (cf. <a ref='John 17:20–21'>Jn 17:20–21</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:39'>Ac 2:39</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:18'>29:18</a> <b>a root bearing poisonous fruit and wormwood.</b> The picture was of a root spreading poison and bitterness into the whole tree. The metaphor indicates permeation of idolatry throughout Israel because of the action of an individual family or tribe, precipitating God’s curse and wrath. <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:19'>29:19</a> <b>to sweep away the watered</b> land <b>with the dry.</b> The meaning is that the deceived individual rebel against Yahweh follows only his wicked heart and could not hide within the total community. The idolater would stand out and bear the judgment for his idolatry. <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:20'>29:20</a> <b>blot out his name from under heaven.</b> The idolater would have no place among God’s people, because God would curse him and then kill him (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:19'>25:19</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 17:14'>Ex 17:14</a> ). This very strong language reveals how God feels about idolatry, which is forbidden in the Decalogue ( <a ref='Exodus 20:2–7'>Ex 20:2–7</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:21'>29:21</a> <b>this book of the law.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:9'>31:9</a> .</i> <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:22'>29:22</a> <b>the generation to come … and the foreigner.</b> In a future day, both Israel and the nations would see the results of God’s judgment upon the land of Israel because of Israel’s disobedience, as a witness to the holy standard God has established in His law. Cf. <a ref='Leviticus 26:31–32'>Lv 26:31–32</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:23'>29:23</a> <b>Sodom.</b> The punishment Yahweh would bring upon Israel in the future was likened to that of Sodom and her allies whom Yahweh buried in fiery brimstone in the time of Abraham and Lot (see <a ref='Genesis 19:24–29'>Ge 19:24–29</a> ). It should be noted that Sodom and vicinity resembled paradise, the garden of God, before its destruction (cf. <a ref='Genesis 13:10'>Ge 13:10</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:24'>29:24</a> This question is answered in vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:25–28'>25–28</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:29'>29:29</a> God has not revealed all that could be disclosed from His infinite mind. What He has unveiled stands sufficient for salvation, maturation in the faith, and glorifying God by obedience to His Word. While there are secret things unknown, believers will be held accountable to obey only what they do know accented by the divine threat of judgment for continued sinful disobedience. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:1–10'>30:1–10</a> The rejection of God by Israel, and of Israel by God and the subsequent dispersion were not the end of the story of God’s people. Having anticipated a time when Israel’s disobedience would lead to her captivity in a foreign land, Moses looked beyond the destruction of that time of judgment to an even more distant time of restoration and redemption for Israel (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 26:40–45'>Lv 26:40–45</a> ). This future restoration and blessing of Israel would take place under the New Covenant ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer 31:31–34</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 32:36–41'>32:36–41</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 36:25–27'>Eze 36:25–27</a></i> ). For a comparison of the New Covenant with the Old Covenant, <i>see notes on <a ref='2 Corinthians 3:6–18'>2Co 3:6–18</a></i> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:1–3'>30:1–3</a> <b>you cause</b> these things <b>to return to your heart.</b> Moses moved to the future when curses would be over and blessings would come. At some future time, after disobedience to Yahweh brought upon Israel the curses of the covenant, the people will remember that the circumstances in which they found themselves were the inevitable consequence of their disobedience, and in repentance they will return to Yahweh. This repentance will lead to a wholehearted commitment of obedience to God’s commandments (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:8'>8</a> ) and the consequent end of Israel’s distress (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:3'>3</a> ). This is the ultimate salvation of Israel by faith in Christ, spoken of by Isaiah ( <a ref='Isaiah 54:4–8'>54:4–8</a> ), Jeremiah ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>31:31–34</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 32:37–42'>32:37–42</a> ), Ezekiel ( <a ref='Ezekiel 36:23–38'>36:23–38</a> ), Hosea ( <a ref='Hosea 14:1–9'>14:1–9</a> ), Joel ( <a ref='Joel 3:16–21'>3:16–21</a> ), Amos ( <a ref='Amos 9:11–15'>9:11–15</a> ), Zephaniah ( <a ref='Zephaniah 3:14–20'>3:14–20</a> ), Zechariah ( <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–13:9'>12:10—13:9</a> ), Malachi ( <a ref='Malachi 3:16–4:4'>3:16—4:4</a> ), and Paul ( <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:4–5'>30:4–5</a> The gathering of Jews out of all the countries of the earth will follow Israel’s final redemption. Restoration to the land will be in fulfillment of the promise of the covenant given to Abraham (see <a ref='Genesis 12:7'>Ge 12:7</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 13:15'>13:15</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 15:18–21'>15:18–21</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 17:8'>17:8</a> ) and so often reiterated by Moses and the prophets. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:6'>30:6</a> <b>Yahweh … will circumcise your heart.</b> Cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:16'>10:16</a> . This work of God in the innermost being of the individual is the true salvation that grants a new will to obey Him in place of the former spiritual insensitivity and stubbornness (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 4:4'>Jer 4:4</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 9:25'>9:25</a> ; <a ref='Romans 2:28–29'>Ro 2:28–29</a> ). This new heart will allow the Israelite to love Yahweh wholeheartedly, and is the essential feature of the New Covenant (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:4'>29:4</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:10'>30:10</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer 31:31–34</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 32:37–42'>32:37–42</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 11:19'>Eze 11:19</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 36:26'>36:26</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Jeremiah 4:4'>Jer 4:4</a> .</i> <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:7'>30:7</a> <b>on your enemies.</b> The curses that had fallen on Israel because of disobedience will in the future come upon the nations that have enslaved the Jews. The judgment of God would come upon those who cursed the physical seed of Abraham in fulfillment of <a ref='Genesis 12:3'>Ge 12:3</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:8–9'>30:8–9</a> <b>you shall return and listen to the voice of Yahweh.</b> With a new heart under the New Covenant, Israel would obey all the commandments of Yahweh. This would result in Yahweh’s blessing, which would bring greater prosperity than Israel had ever previously experienced. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:10'>30:10</a> Here is a renewed enforcement of the indispensable fruit of salvation and another echo of the constant theme of this book. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:11–14'>30:11–14</a> After remembering the failures of the past and the prospects for the future, Moses earnestly admonished the people to make the right choice. The issue facing them was to enjoy salvation and blessing by loving God so wholeheartedly that they would willingly live in obedience to His Word. The choice was simple, yet profound. It was stated in simple terms so that they could understand and grasp what God expected of them (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:11'>11</a> ). Although God had spoken from heaven, He had spoken through Moses in words every person could understand (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:12'>12</a> ). They did not have to search at some point beyond the sea (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:13'>13</a> ). The truth was there, through Moses, now in their hearts and minds (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:14'>14</a> ). All the truth necessary for choosing to love and obey God and thus avoid disobedience and cursing, they had heard and known (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:15'>15</a> ). Paul quotes vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:12–14'>12–14</a> in <a ref='Romans 10:6–8'>Ro 10:6–8</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:15'>30:15</a> Here Moses pinpoints the choice—to love and obey God is life and prosperity, to reject God is death and adversity. If they chose to love God and obey His Word, they would enjoy all God’s blessings (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:16'>16</a> ). If they refused to love and obey Him, they would be severely and immediately punished (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:17–18'>17–18</a> ). Paul, in speaking about salvation in the NT, makes use of this appeal made by Moses ( <a ref='Romans 10:1–13'>Ro 10:1–13</a> ). Like Moses, Paul is saying that the message of salvation is plain and understandable. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:19'>30:19</a> <b>choose life.</b> Moses forces the decision, exhorting Israel on the plains of Moab before God (heaven) and man (earth) to choose by believing in and loving God, the life available through the New Covenant (see v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:6'>6</a> ). Sadly, Israel failed to respond to this call to the right choice (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:16–18'>31:16–18</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:27–29'>27–29</a> ). Choosing life or death was also emphasized by Jesus. The one who believed in Him had the promise of eternal life; while the one who refused to believe faced eternal death (cf. <a ref='John 3:1–36'>Jn 3:1–36</a> ). Every person faces this same choice. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:1–34:12'>31:1—34:12</a> Two themes dominate the last 4 chapters of Deuteronomy: 1) the death of Moses ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:1–2'>31:1–2</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:14'>14</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:16'>16</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:26–29'>26–29</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:48–52'>32:48–52</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:1'>33:1</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:1–8'>34:1–8</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:10–12'>10–12</a> ) and 2) the succession of Joshua ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:1–8'>31:1–8</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:14'>14</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:44'>32:44</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:9'>34:9</a> ). These final chapters are centered around two more speeches by Moses: 1) the Song of Moses ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:1–43'>32:1–43</a> ), and 2) the Blessings of Moses ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:1–29'>33:1–29</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:1'>31:1</a> <b>Moses went and spoke.</b> Though some interpreters view this verse as the conclusion to the foregoing address in chaps. <a ref='De 29-30'>29–30</a> , it is better to see these words as an introduction to the words of Moses which follow, based upon the general pattern of Deuteronomy. Verses <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:2–6'>2–6</a> are addressed to every Israelite. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:2'>31:2</a> <b>120 years old.</b> This was the age of Moses at his death. According to <a ref='Acts 7:30'>Ac 7:30</a> , Moses spent 40 years in Midian tending sheep. Thus, the life of Moses is broken down into three 40-year periods. His first 40 years were spent in Egypt ( <a ref='Exodus 2:1–15'>Ex 2:1–15</a> ). The second 40 years were spent in Midian ( <a ref='Exodus 2:15–4:19'>Ex 2:15—4:19</a> ). His final 40 years were spent leading Israel out of Egypt and through the wilderness to the Promised Land. The life and ministry of Moses were completed, but God’s work would go on (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:3'>3a</a> ). <b>come and go.</b> Here is an idiom for engaging in a normal day’s work and activity. Though still strong for his age (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:7'>34:7</a> ), Moses admitted that he no longer could provide the daily leadership necessary for Israel. Furthermore, God would not allow him to enter the land over the Jordan because of his sin at the waters of Meribah (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:51'>32:51</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:3'>31:3</a> <b>God … will cross … Joshua … will cross.</b> Though Joshua was to be the new human leader over Israel (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:3–7'>31:3–7</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:23'>23</a> ), it was Yahweh Himself who was the real leader and power. He would cross over ahead of them to enable them to destroy the nations. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:4'>31:4</a> <b>Sihon and Og.</b> Israel was assured that the nations of the land would be destroyed by Yahweh in the same way that He had recently defeated the Amorite kings, Sihon and Og, on the east side of the Jordan River (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:26–3:11'>2:26—3:11</a> ). That was a preview of what was to come (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:5'>5</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:6–8'>31:6–8</a> <b>Be strong and courageous.</b> The strength and courage of the warriors of Israel would come from their confidence that their God was with them and would not forsake them. In vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:7–8'>7–8</a> , Moses repeated the substance of his exhortation, this time addressing it specifically to Joshua in the presence of the people to encourage him and to remind the people that Joshua’s leadership was being assumed with the full approval of God. This principle for faith and confidence is repeated in <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:23'>31:23</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 1:5–7'>Jos 1:5–7</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 10:12'>2Sa 10:12</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 2:2'>2Ki 2:2</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 22:11–13'>1Chr 22:11–13</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 32:1–8'>2Chr 32:1–8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 27:14'>Ps 27:14</a> . The writer of Hebrews quotes vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:8'>8</a> in <a ref='Hebrews 13:5'>13:5</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:9'>31:9</a> <b>Moses wrote this law.</b> At the least, Moses, perhaps with the aid of some scribes or elders who assisted him in leading Israel, wrote down the law that he had explained in the first 32 chapters of Deuteronomy (cf. v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:24'>24</a> ). However, since the law explained in Deuteronomy had been given in portions of Exodus through Numbers, it seems best to view this written law as all that is presently found in Scripture from <a ref='Ge 1'>Ge 1</a> through <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:47'>Dt 32:47</a> . After Moses’ death, <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:48–34:12'>Dt 32:48—34:12</a> were added to complete the canonical Torah, perhaps by one of the elders who had served with Moses, even Joshua. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:11'>31:11</a> <b>you shall read this law in front of all Israel.</b> The law that Moses wrote down was given to the priests who were required to be its custodians and protectors and to read it in the hearing of all Israel at the Feast of Tabernacles during each sabbatical year. This reading of the law every 7 years was to remind the people to live in submission to their awe-inspiring God. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:14'>31:14</a> <b>the tent of meeting.</b> Yahweh told Moses to summon Joshua to the tent where He met Israel, and the presence of Yahweh appeared in the pillar of cloud standing at the door of the Holy Place (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:15'>15</a> ). This signaled God’s confirmation of Joshua, the former military captain (see <a ref='Exodus 17:9–14'>Ex 17:9–14</a> ) and spy (see <a ref='Numbers 13:16'>Nu 13:16</a> ), as Israel’s new leader. God’s message to Joshua is summed up in vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:16–22'>16–22</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:16–21'>31:16–21</a> <b>they will forsake Me and break My covenant.</b> After Moses’ death, Yahweh Himself predicts that in spite of what He has commanded ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:11'>30:11</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:20'>20</a> ), the Israelites would forsake Him by turning to worship other gods and thereby break the Sinaitic Covenant. Having forsaken God, the people would then be forsaken by God with the inevitable result that disaster would fall upon them at every turn. This is one of the saddest texts in the OT. After all God had done, He knew they would forsake Him. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:19'>31:19</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:22'>22</a> <b>write this song.</b> The song that Yahweh gave Moses to teach the Israelites would be a constant reminder of their disobedience to Yahweh and the results of that disobedience. The song was written that same day and is recorded in <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:1–43'>32:1–43</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:23'>31:23</a> <b>I will be with you.</b> Joshua was to assume his lonely role of leadership over Israel with an assurance of the companionship and strength of Yahweh. God’s presence with him was sufficient to enable him to meet boldly every obstacle that the future could bring (see <a ref='Joshua 1:5'>Jos 1:5</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 3:7'>3:7</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:24'>31:24</a> <b>in a book.</b> The words that Moses had spoken were written down in a book that was placed beside the ark of the covenant (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:26'>26</a> ). Only the Ten Commandments were placed in the ark itself ( <a ref='Exodus 25:16'>Ex 25:16</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 31:18'>31:18</a> ). The “book of the law” (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:26'>26</a> ) was one of the titles for the Pentateuch in the rest of Scripture ( <a ref='Joshua 1:8'>Jos 1:8</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 8:34'>8:34</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:27'>31:27</a> <b>your rebellion and your stiff-neck.</b> See <a ref='Deuteronomy 9:6'>9:6</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 9:13'>13</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:16'>10:16</a> . Moses was well acquainted with Israel’s obstinate ways even in the most gracious of divine provision. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:29'>31:29</a> <b>you will act corruptly.</b> Dominated by the practice of idolatry (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:16'>4:16</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:25'>25</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 9:12'>9:12</a> ), the people would become wicked. <b>evil will befall you in the last days.</b> “The last days” (lit. “at the end of the days”) referred to the far distant future. This was the time when the king would come from Judah ( <a ref='Genesis 49:8–12'>Ge 49:8–12</a> ) to defeat Israel’s enemies ( <a ref='Numbers 24:17–19'>Nu 24:17–19</a> ). Here it is revealed that it would also be a time when disaster would fall upon Israel because of evil done, thus bringing Yahweh’s wrath. The description of God’s judgment on Israel and the nations in this song can’t be limited to the immediate future of the people as they entered the land, but extends to issues which are eschatological in time and global in extent, as the song indicates ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:1–43'>32:1–43</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:30–32:43'>31:30—32:43</a> This prophetic, poetic song has as its central theme Israel’s apostasy, which brings God’s certain judgment. The song begins with a short introduction emphasizing the steadfast God and the fickle nation (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:1–6'>1–6</a> ). The song describes God’s election of Israel (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:8–9'>8–9</a> ) and His care for them from the time of the wilderness wanderings (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:10–12'>10–12</a> ) to their possession and initial enjoyment of the blessings in the land (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:13–14'>13–14</a> ). However, Israel’s neglect of God’s goodness and her apostasy (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:15–18'>15–18</a> ) would bring God’s future outpouring of wrath on His people (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:19–27'>19–27</a> ) and Israel’s continuing blindness in the face of God’s wrath (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:28–33'>28–33</a> ). Ultimately, God’s vengeance would strip Israel of all power and turn the nation from idolatry (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:34–38'>34–38</a> ). Then, God would bring His judgment upon the nations, both His enemies and Israel’s (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:39–42'>39–42</a> ). The song ends with a call to the nations to rejoice with Israel because God would punish His enemies and spiritually heal both Israel and her land (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:43'>43</a> ). <a ref='Eze 16'>Ezekiel 16</a> should be studied as a comparison to this chapter. It recites similar matters in graphic and picturesque language. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:1'>32:1</a> <b>Give ear, O heavens … and let the earth hear.</b> All of creation was called to be an audience to hear the message to Israel as in <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:19'>30:19</a> because the truth Moses was about to proclaim concerned the whole universe. It did so because it involved the honor of God the Creator so disregarded by sinners, the justification of God so righteous in all His ways, and the manifestation in heaven and earth of God’s judgment and salvation (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:43'>43</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:2'>32:2</a> <b>what I have learned.</b> Moses imparted instruction that if received would, like rain, dew, droplets, and showers to the earth, bring benefit to the hearts and the minds of the hearers. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:3'>32:3</a> <b>Ascribe greatness to our God!</b> Cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 3:24'>3:24</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:24'>5:24</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 9:26'>9:26</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:2'>11:2</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 150:2'>Ps 150:2</a> . This command refers to the greatness of God revealed in His acts of omnipotence. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:4'>32:4</a> <b>The Rock!</b> This word, representing the stability and permanence of God, was placed at the beginning of the verse for emphasis and was followed by a series of phrases which elaborated the attributes of God as the Rock of Israel. It is one of the principal themes in this song (see vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:15'>15</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:18'>18</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:30–31'>30–31</a> ), stressing the unchanging nature of God in contrast with the fickle nature of the people. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:5'>32:5</a> <b>a perverse and crooked generation.</b> Israel, in contrast to God, was warped and twisted. Jesus used this phrase in <a ref='Matthew 17:17'>Mt 17:17</a> of an unbelieving generation and Paul in <a ref='Philippians 2:15'>Php 2:15</a> of the dark world of mankind in rebellion against God. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:6'>32:6</a> <b>your Father.</b> The foolishness and senselessness of Israel would be seen in the fact that they would rebel against God who as a Father had brought them forth and formed them into a nation. As Father, He was the progenitor and originator of the nation and the One who had matured and sustained it. This idea of God as Father of the nation is emphasized in the OT (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 29:10'>1Chr 29:10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 63:16'>Is 63:16</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 64:8'>64:8</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 2:10'>Mal 2:10</a> ) while the idea of God as Father of individual believers is developed in the NT (cf. <a ref='Romans 8:15'>Ro 8:15</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 4:6'>Ga 4:6</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:7'>32:7</a> <b>Remember the ancient days.</b> A call to reflect on past history and to inquire about the lessons to be learned. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:8–9'>32:8–9</a> <b>the Most High.</b> This title for God emphasized His sovereignty and authority over all the nations (see <a ref='Genesis 11:9'>Ge 11:9</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 10:32'>10:32</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 14:18'>14:18</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 24:16'>Nu 24:16</a> ) with the amazing revelation that in the whole plan for the world, God had as His goal the salvation of His chosen people. God ordained a plan where the number of nations (70 according to <a ref='Ge 10'>Ge 10</a> ) corresponded to the number of the children of Israel (70 according to <a ref='Genesis 46:27'>Ge 46:27</a> ). Further, as God gave the nations their lands, He established their boundaries, leaving Israel enough land to sustain their expected population. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:10–14'>32:10–14</a> This whole description of what God did for Israel is figurative. Israel is like a man in the horrible desert in danger of death, without food or water, who is rescued by Yahweh. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:10'>32:10</a> <b>as the pupil of His eye.</b> Lit. “the apple of His eye.” Just as the pupil of the eye is essential for vision and, therefore, closely protected, especially in a howling wind, so God closely protected Israel. Cf. <a ref='Psalms 17:8'>Ps 17:8</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 7:2'>Pr 7:2</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:11'>32:11</a> <b>hovers over its young.</b> Yahweh exercised His loving care for Israel like an eagle caring for its young, especially as they were taught to fly. As they began to fly and had little strength, they would start to fall. At that point, an eagle would stop their fall by spreading its wings so they could land on them; so Yahweh has carried Israel and not let the nation fall. He had been training Israel to fly on His wings of love and omnipotence. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:12'>32:12</a> <b>no foreign god.</b> Moses makes clear that God alone carried Israel through all its struggles and victories, thus depriving the people of any excuse for apostasy from Yahweh by interest in false gods. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:13'>32:13</a> <b>honey from the rock.</b> A reference to honeycombs located in the fissures of the faces of a cliff is used because Canaan had many wild bees. <b>oil from the flinty rock.</b> Likely a reference to olive trees growing in rocky places otherwise bereft of fruit-growing trees. These metaphoric phrases regarding honey and oil point to the most valuable products coming out of the most unproductive places. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:14'>32:14</a> <b>rams … of Bashan.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Deuteronomy 3:1'>3:1</a> .</i> <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:15'>32:15</a> <b>Jeshurun.</b> The word means “righteous” (lit. “the upright one”), i.e., a name for Israel which sarcastically expresses the fact that Israel did not live up to God’s law after entering the land. God uses this name to remind Israel of His calling and to severely rebuke apostasy. <b>grew fat and kicked.</b> Like an ox which had become fat and intractable, Israel became affluent because of the bountiful provisions of God but, instead of being thankful and obedient, became rebellious against Yahweh (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:10–15'>6:10–15</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:16'>32:16</a> <b>strange</b> gods. Israel turned to worship the gods of the people in the land. These were gods they had not before acknowledged (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:17'>17</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:17'>32:17</a> <b>demons.</b> Cf. <a ref='Leviticus 17:7'>Lv 17:7</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 11:15'>2Chr 11:15</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 106:37'>Ps 106:37</a> . The term describes those angels who fell with Satan and constitute the evil force that fights against God and His holy angels. Idol worship is a form of demon worship, as demon spirits impersonate the idol and work their wicked strategies through the system of false religion tied to the false god. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:18–33'>32:18–33</a> For this foolish apostasy, Yahweh will severely judge Israel. This visitation of anger is in the form of a divine resolution to punish Israelites whenever they pursue idols, including the next generation of sons and daughters (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:19'>19</a> ). In vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:20–22'>20–22</a> , Moses quotes Yahweh Himself. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:21'>32:21</a> <b>not a people.</b> As Yahweh was provoked to jealousy by Israel’s worship of that which was “not God,” so He would provoke Israel to jealousy and anger by humiliation before a foolish, vile “no-nation.” In <a ref='Romans 10:19'>Ro 10:19</a> , Paul applied the term “not a nation” to the Gentile nations generally. Jews who worship a “no-god” will be judged by a “no-people.” <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:22'>32:22</a> <b>a fire is kindled … to the lowest part of Sheol.</b> Cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:20'>29:20</a> . Once the fire of God’s anger was kindled, it knew no limits in its destructive force, reaching to even those in the grave, an indication of God’s eternal judgment against those who oppose Him. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:23'>32:23</a> <b>calamities … arrows.</b> The calamities (lit. “evil”) are described in v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:24'>24</a> . The arrows represent the enemies who would defeat Israel in war and are further described in vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:25–27'>25–27</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:27'>32:27</a> <b>Our hand is triumphant.</b> Military arrogance. The only thing that would prevent Yahweh from permitting the complete destruction of His people would be His concern that the Gentiles might claim for themselves the honor of victory over Israel. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:31'>32:31</a> <b>rock … Rock.</b> A contrast between the gods of the nations (“rock”) and Israel’s true God (“Rock”). Israel could smite its foes with very little difficulty because of the weakness of their gods, who are not like the Rock Jehovah. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:32'>32:32</a> <b>the vine of Sodom.</b> Employing the metaphor of a vineyard, its grapes and its wine, the wickedness of Israel’s enemies was described as having its roots in Sodom and Gomorrah, the evil cities destroyed by God as recorded in <a ref='Genesis 19:1–29'>Ge 19:1–29</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:34'>32:34</a> <b>Sealed up in My treasuries.</b> The wicked acts of Israel’s enemies were known to God and are stored up in His storehouse. At the proper time, God will avenge. Paul uses this image in <a ref='Romans 2:4–5'>Ro 2:4–5</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:35'>32:35</a> <b>Vengeance is Mine, and retribution.</b> The manner and timing of the repayment of man’s wickedness is God’s prerogative. This principle is reaffirmed in the NT in <a ref='Romans 12:19'>Ro 12:19</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:30'>Heb 10:30</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:36'>32:36</a> This is the promise that Yahweh will judge Israel as a nation, but that the nation is composed of righteous and wicked. God actually helps the righteous by destroying the wicked. “His servants” are the righteous, all who in the time of judgment are faithful to Yahweh (cf. <a ref='Malachi 3:16–4:3'>Mal 3:16—4:3</a> ). Yahweh has judged Israel, not to destroy the nation, but to punish the sinners and show the folly of their false gods (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:37–38'>37–38</a> ). At the same time, Yahweh has always shown compassion for those who have loved and obeyed Him. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:39'>32:39</a> <b>that I, I am He.</b> After showing the worthlessness of false gods (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:37–38'>37–38</a> ), this declaration of the nature of God was presented in contrast to show that the God of Israel is the living God, the only One who can offer help and protection to Israel. He has the power of life and death with regard to Israel (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 2:6'>1Sa 2:6</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 5:7'>2Ki 5:7</a> ) and the power to wound and heal them (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 30:26'>Is 30:26</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 57:17–18'>57:17–18</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 17:14'>Jer 17:14</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 6:1'>Hos 6:1</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:40–42'>32:40–42</a> <b>I lift up My hand.</b> God takes an oath to bring vengeance on His enemies. Here (as in <a ref='Exodus 6:8'>Ex 6:8</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 14:28'>Nu 14:28</a> ) the hand is used anthropomorphically of God, who can swear by no greater than His eternal Self (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 45:23'>Is 45:23</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 22:5'>Jer 22:5</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 6:17'>Heb 6:17</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:43'>32:43</a> <b>O nations, cause His people to shout for joy.</b> As a result of the execution of God’s vengeance, all nations will be called upon to praise with Israel Yahweh who will have provided redemptively for them in Christ and also provided a new beginning in the land. This atonement for the Land is the satisfaction of God’s wrath by the sacrifice of His enemies in judgment. The atonement for the people is by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross (cf. <a ref='Psalms 79:9'>Ps 79:9</a> ). Paul quotes this passage in <a ref='Romans 15:10'>Ro 15:10</a> , as does the writer of Hebrews ( <a ref='Hebrews 1:6'>1:6</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:47'>32:47</a> <b>it is your life.</b> Moses reiterated to Israel that obedience to Yahweh’s commands was to be the key to her living long in the land that God had prepared and called for this song to be a kind of national anthem which the leaders should see is frequently repeated to animate the people to love and obey God. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:48–34:12'>32:48—34:12</a> The anticipation of and record of Moses’ death ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:48–52'>32:48–52</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:1–12'>34:1–12</a> ) bracket the recording of Moses’ blessing given to Israel before his death. This literary unit was composed and added to the text after the death of Moses. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:49'>32:49</a> <b>Mount Nebo.</b> A peak in the Abarim range of mountains to the east of the north end of the Dead Sea, from where Moses would be able to see across to the Promised Land, which he was not permitted to enter. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:50'>32:50</a> <b>gathered to his people.</b> An idiom for death. See <a ref='Genesis 25:8'>Ge 25:8</a> , <a ref='Genesis 25:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 35:29'>35:29</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 49:33'>49:33</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 20:24'>Nu 20:24</a> , <a ref='Numbers 20:26'>26</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 31:2'>31:2</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:1–29'>33:1–29</a> The final words of Moses to the people were a listing of the blessings of each of the tribes of Israel, Simeon excluded (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:6–25'>6–25</a> ). These blessings were introduced and concluded with passages which praise God (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:2–5'>2–5</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:26–29'>26–29</a> ). That these blessings of Moses are presented in this chapter as recorded by someone other than Moses is clear because in v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:1'>1</a> , Moses was viewed as already being dead, and as the words of Moses were presented, the clause “he said” (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:2'>2</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:7–8'>7–8</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:12–13'>12–13</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:18'>18</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:20'>20</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:22–24'>22–24</a> ) was used. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:1'>33:1</a> <b>the man of God.</b> The first use of this phrase in Scripture. Subsequently, some 70 times in the OT, messengers of God (especially prophets) are called “a man of God” ( <a ref='1 Samuel 2:27'>1Sa 2:27</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 9:6'>9:6</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 13:1'>1Ki 13:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 17:18'>17:18</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 4:7'>2Ki 4:7</a> ). The NT uses this title for Timothy ( <a ref='1 Timothy 6:11'>1Ti 6:11</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 3:17'>2Ti 3:17</a> ). Moses was viewed among such prophets in this conclusion to the book (see <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:10'>34:10</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:2'>33:2</a> <b>Sinai … Seir … Paran.</b> These are mountains associated with the giving of the law—Sinai on the south, Seir on the northeast, and Paran on the north. These mountains provide a beautiful metaphor, borrowed from the dawn. God, like the morning sun, is the Light that rises to give His beams to all the Promised Land. <b>holy ones.</b> Probably a reference to the angels who assisted God when the law was mediated to Moses at Mt. Sinai (see <a ref='Acts 7:53'>Ac 7:53</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:19'>Ga 3:19</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 2:2'>Heb 2:2</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:3'>33:3</a> <b>He loves the people.</b> Notwithstanding the awe-inspiring symbols of majesty displayed at Sinai, the law was given in kindness and love to provide both temporal and eternal blessing to those with a heart to obey it. Cf. <a ref='Romans 13:8–10'>Ro 13:8–10</a> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:5'>33:5</a> <b>king in Jeshurun.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:15'>32:15</a> .</i> Lit. “he was king.” It is possible that this refers back to Moses in v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:4'>4</a> . However, it is more likely speaking of God since: 1) Moses is never called “king” elsewhere in Scripture; 2) Moses was not anointed to be king as were the other human kings of Israel; 3) Israel forsook God as their king when they chose Saul to be king ( <a ref='1 Samuel 8:7'>1Sa 8:7</a> ); and 4) God is elsewhere actually declared to be king over Jeshurun ( <a ref='Isaiah 44:1–6'>Is 44:1–6</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:6'>33:6</a> <b>Reuben.</b> Here is the prayer that this tribe would survive in large numbers (cf. <a ref='Numbers 1:21'>Nu 1:21</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 2:11'>2:11</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:7'>33:7</a> <b>Judah.</b> Moses prayed that this tribe would be powerful in leading the nation to be victorious in battle through the help of Yahweh. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:8–11'>33:8–11</a> <b>Levi.</b> Moses prays for the Levites to fulfill their tasks, God granting to them protection from their enemies. Moses omitted Simeon, but that tribe did receive a number of allies in the southern territory of Judah ( <a ref='Joshua 19:2–9'>Jos 19:2–9</a> ) and did not lose their identity (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 4:34–38'>1Chr 4:34–38</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:12'>33:12</a> <b>Benjamin.</b> That this tribe would have security and peace because Yahweh would shield them was Moses’ request. They were given the land in the north of Judah near Jerusalem. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:13–17'>33:13–17</a> <b>Joseph.</b> This included both Ephraim and Manasseh (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:17'>17</a> ), who would enjoy material prosperity (vv. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:13–16'>13–16</a> ) and military might (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:17'>17</a> ), which would compensate and reward them for the Egyptian slavery of their ancestor (see <a ref='Genesis 49:26'>Ge 49:26</a> ). Ephraim would have greater military success in the future than Manasseh as the outworking of Jacob’s blessing of the younger over the older (see <a ref='Genesis 48:20'>Ge 48:20</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:18'>33:18</a> <b>Zebulun … Issachar.</b> Moses prayed that these two tribes from the fifth and sixth sons of Leah would receive God’s blessing in their daily lives, particularly through the trade on the seas. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:20'>33:20</a> <b>Gad.</b> This tribe had large territory east of the Jordan and was a leader in gaining the victory in battles in Canaan. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:22'>33:22</a> <b>Dan.</b> Dan had the potential for great energy and strength and leaped from its southern settlement to establish a colony in the north. Cf. <a ref='Genesis 49:17–18'>Ge 49:17–18</a> , where Dan is compared to a serpent. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:23'>33:23</a> <b>Naphtali.</b> This tribe would enjoy the favor of God in the fullness of His blessing, having land in the west of Galilee and south of the northern Danites. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:24'>33:24</a> <b>Asher.</b> The request is that this tribe would experience abundant fertility and prosperity, depicted by reference to a foot-operated oil press. Shoes of hard metal suited both country people and soldiers. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:26–27'>33:26–27</a> <b>the God of Jeshurun.</b> Moses concluded his blessings with a reminder of the uniqueness of Israel’s God. For “Jeshurun,” <i>see note on <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:15'>32:15</a></i> . <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:28–29'>33:28–29</a> This pledge was only partially fulfilled after they entered the land, but it awaits a complete fulfillment in the kingdom of Messiah. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:28'>33:28</a> <b>The fountain of Jacob.</b> This is a euphemism for Jacob’s seed, referring to his posterity. <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:1–12'>34:1–12</a> This concluding chapter was obviously written by someone other than Moses (probably the writer of Joshua) to bridge out of Deuteronomy into Joshua. <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:1'>34:1</a> <b>Pisgah.</b> The range or ridge of which Mt.

Cf. <a ref='Jude 1:9'>Jd 9</a> , which recounts Michael’s and Satan’s dispute over Moses’ body. <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:7'>34:7</a> <b>not dim … abated.</b> Moses’ physical vision and physical health were not impaired. It was not death by natural causes that kept Moses from leading Israel into the Promised Land; it was his unfaithfulness to Yahweh at Meribah (see <a ref='Numbers 20:12'>Nu 20:12</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:8'>34:8</a> <b>thirty days.</b> The mourning period for Moses conformed to that of Aaron ( <a ref='Numbers 20:29'>Nu 20:29</a> ). <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:9'>34:9</a> <b>spirit of wisdom … laid his hands.</b> Joshua received 1) confirmation of the military and administrative ability necessary to the task Yahweh had given him, as well as, 2) the spiritual wisdom to rely on and to be committed to Yahweh through the laying on of Moses’ hands. <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:10'>34:10</a> <b>not … a prophet … like Moses.</b> Moses was the greatest of all the OT prophets, one whom Yahweh knew intimately. Not until John the Baptist was there another prophet greater than Moses (see <a ref='Matthew 11:11'>Mt 11:11</a> ). After John, the Prophet came of whom Moses wrote (cf. <a ref='John 1:21'>Jn 1:21</a> , <a ref='John 1:25'>25</a> ; <a ref='John 6:14'>6:14</a> with <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:15'>Dt 18:15</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Acts 3:22'>Ac 3:22</a> ; <a ref='Acts 7:37'>7:37</a> ).
