    "content": "The Book of Joel Title The Greek Septuagint (LXX) and Latin Vulgate (Vg.) versions follow the Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT), titling this book after Joel the prophet, the recipient of the message from God ( <a ref='Joel 1:1'>1:1</a> ). The name means “the Lord is God” and refers to at least a dozen men in the OT. Joel is referred to only once in the NT ( <a ref='Acts 2:16–21'>Ac 2:16–21</a> ). Author and Date The author identified himself only as “Joel, the son of Pethuel” ( <a ref='Joel 1:1'>1:1</a> ). The prophecy provides little else about the man. Even the name of his father is not mentioned elsewhere in the OT. Although he displayed a profound zeal for the temple sacrifices ( <a ref='Joel 1:9'>1:9</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:13–16'>2:13–16</a> ), his familiarity with pastoral and agricultural life and his separation from the priests ( <a ref='Joel 1:13–14'>1:13–14</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:17'>2:17</a> ) suggest he was not a Levite. Extrabiblical tradition records that he was from the tribe of Reuben, from the town of Bethom or Beth-haram, located northeast of the Dead Sea on the border of Reuben and Gad. The context of the prophecy, however, hints that he was a Judean from the Jerusalem vicinity, since the tone of a stranger is absent. Dating the book relies solely on canonical position, historical allusions, and linguistic elements. Because of: 1) the lack of any mention of later world powers (Assyria, Babylon, or Persia); 2) the fact that Joel’s style is like that of Hosea and Amos rather than of the post-Exilic prophets; and 3) the verbal parallels with other early prophets ( <a ref='Joel 3:16'>Joel 3:16</a> / <a ref='Amos 1:2'>Am 1:2</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:18'>Joel 3:18</a> / <a ref='Amos 9:13'>Am 9:13</a> ), a late ninth century BC date, during the reign of Joash (ca. 835–796 BC), seems most convincing. Nevertheless, while the date of the book cannot be known with certainty, the impact on its interpretation is minimal. The message of Joel is timeless, forming doctrine which could be repeated and applied in any age. Background and Setting Tyre, Sidon, and Philistia had made frequent military incursions into Israel ( <a ref='Joel 3:2'>3:2ff.</a> ). An extended drought and massive invasion of locusts had stripped every green thing from the land and brought severe economic devastation ( <a ref='Joel 1:7–20'>1:7–20</a> ), leaving the southern kingdom weak. This physical disaster gives Joel the illustration for God’s judgment. As the locusts were a judgment on sin, God’s future judgments during the Day of Yahweh will far exceed them. In that day, God will judge His enemies and bless the faithful. No mention is made of specific sins, nor is Judah rebuked for idolatry. Yet, possibly due to a calloused indifference, the prophet calls them to a bona fide repentance, admonishing them to “tear your heart and not your garments” ( <a ref='Joel 2:13'>2:13</a> ). Historical and Theological Themes The theme of Joel is the Day of Yahweh. It permeates all parts of Joel’s message, making it the most sustained treatment in the entire OT ( <a ref='Joel 1:15'>1:15</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:1'>2:1</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:11'>2:11</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:31'>2:31</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:14'>3:14</a> ). The phrase is employed 19 times by 8 different OT authors ( <a ref='Isaiah 2:12'>Is 2:12</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 13:6'>13:6</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 13:9'>9</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 13:5'>Eze 13:5</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 30:3'>30:3</a> ; <a ref='Joel 1:15'>Joel 1:15</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:1'>2:1</a> , <a ref='Joel 2:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Joel 2:31'>31</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:14'>3:14</a> ; <a ref='Amos 5:18'>Am 5:18</a> [2x], <a ref='Amos 5:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Obadiah 1:15'>Ob 15</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 1:7'>Zep 1:7</a> , <a ref='Zephaniah 1:14'>14</a> [2x]; <a ref='Zechariah 14:1'>Zec 14:1</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 4:5'>Mal 4:5</a> ). The phrase does not have reference to a chronological time period, but to a general period of wrath and judgment uniquely belonging to the Lord. It is exclusively the day which unveils His character—mighty, powerful, and holy, thus terrifying His enemies. The Day of Yahweh does not always refer to an eschatological event; on occasion it has a near historical fulfillment, as seen in <a ref='Ezekiel 13:5'>Eze 13:5</a> , where it speaks of the Babylonian conquest and destruction of Jerusalem. As is common in prophecy, the near fulfillment is a historic event upon which to comprehend the more distant, eschatological fulfillment. The Day of Yahweh is frequently associated with seismic disturbances (e.g., <a ref='Joel 2:1–11'>2:1–11</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:31'>2:31</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:16'>3:16</a> ), violent weather ( <a ref='Ezekiel 13:5'>Eze 13:5ff.</a> ), clouds and thick darkness (e.g., <a ref='Joel 2:2'>2:2</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 1:7'>Zep 1:7ff.</a> ), cosmic upheaval ( <a ref='Joel 2:3'>2:3</a> , <a ref='Joel 2:30'>30</a> ), and as a “great and very awesome” ( <a ref='Joel 2:11'>2:11</a> ) day that would “come as destruction from the Almighty” ( <a ref='Joel 1:15'>1:15</a> ). The latter half of Joel depicts time immediately prior to and subsequent to the Day of Yahweh in terms of promise and hope. There will be a pouring out of the Spirit on all flesh, accompanied by prophetic utterances, dreams, visions ( <a ref='Joel 2:28–29'>2:28–29</a> ), as well as the coming of Elijah, an epiphany bringing restoration and hope ( <a ref='Malachi 4:5–6'>Mal 4:5–6</a> ). As a result of the Day of Yahweh there will be physical blessings, fruitfulness, and prosperity ( <a ref='Joel 2:21'>2:21ff.</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:16–21'>3:16–21</a> ). It is a day when judgment is poured out on sinners that subsequently leads to blessings on the penitent, and reaffirmation of God’s covenant with His people. <i>See note on <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:2'>1Th 5:2</a> .</i> Interpretive Challenges It is preferable to view chap. <a ref='Joe 1'>1</a> as describing an actual invasion of locusts that devastated the land. In chap. <a ref='Joe 2'>2</a> , a new level of description meets the interpreter. Here the prophet is projecting something beyond the locust plague of chap. <a ref='Joe 1'>1</a> , elevating the level of description to new heights, with increased intensity that is focused on the plague and the immediate necessity for true repentance. The prophet’s choice of similes, such as “like the appearance of horses” ( <a ref='Joel 2:4'>2:4</a> ) and “like mighty men” ( <a ref='Joel 2:7'>2:7</a> ), suggests that he is still using the actual locusts to illustrate an invasion which can only be the massive overtaking of the final Day of Yahweh. A second issue confronting the interpreter is Peter’s quotation from <a ref='Joel 2:28–32'>Joel 2:28–32</a> in <a ref='Acts 2:16–21'>Ac 2:16–21</a> . Some have viewed the phenomena of <a ref='Ac 2'>Ac 2</a> and the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 as the fulfillment of the Joel passage, while others have reserved its fulfillment to the final Day of Yahweh only—but clearly Joel is referring to the final terrible Day of Yahweh. The pouring out of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost was not a fulfillment, but a preview and sample of the Spirit’s power and work to be released fully and finally in the Messiah’s kingdom after the Day of Yahweh. <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 2:16–21'>Ac 2:16–21</a> .</i> Outline Following <a ref='Joel 1:1'>1:1</a> , the contents of the book are arranged under 3 basic categories. In the first section ( <a ref='Joel 1:2–20'>1:2–20</a> ) the prophet describes the contemporary Day of Yahweh. The land is suffering massive devastation caused by a locust plague and drought. The details of the calamity ( <a ref='Joel 1:2–12'>1:2–12</a> ) are followed by a summons to communal penitence and reformation ( <a ref='Joel 1:13–20'>1:13–20</a> ). The second section ( <a ref='Joel 2:1–17'>2:1–17</a> ) provides a transition from the historical plague of locusts described in chap. <a ref='Joe 1'>1</a> to the eschatological Day of Yahweh in <a ref='Joel 2:18–3:21'>2:18—3:21</a> . Employing the contemporary infestation of locusts as a backdrop, the prophet, with an increased level of intensity, paints a vivid and forceful picture of the impending visitation of the Lord ( <a ref='Joel 2:1–11'>2:1–11</a> ) and, with powerful and explicit terminology, tenaciously renews the appeal for repentance ( <a ref='Joel 2:12–17'>2:12–17</a> ). In the third section ( <a ref='Joel 2:18–3:21'>2:18—3:21</a> ), the Lord speaks directly, assuring His people of His presence among them ( <a ref='Joel 2:27'>2:27</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:17'>3:17</a> , <a ref='Joel 3:21'>21</a> ). This portion of the book assumes that the repentance solicited ( <a ref='Joel 2:12–17'>2:12–17</a> ) had occurred and describes the Lord’s zealous response ( <a ref='Joel 2:18–19'>2:18–19a</a> ) to their prayer. <a ref='Joel 2:18–20'>Joel 2:18–20</a> forms the transition in the message from lamentation and woe to divine assurances of God’s presence and the reversal of the calamities, with <a ref='Joel 2:19'>2:19b</a> , <a ref='Joel 2:20'>20</a> introducing the essence and nature of that reversal. The Lord then gives 3 promises to assure the penitents of His presence: material restoration through the divine healing of their land ( <a ref='Joel 2:21–27'>2:21–27</a> ), spiritual restoration through the divine outpouring of His Spirit ( <a ref='Joel 2:28–32'>2:28–32</a> ), and national restoration through the divine judgment on the unrighteous ( <a ref='Joel 3:1–21'>3:1–21</a> ).

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Joel 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>The word of Yahweh.</b> This introductory phrase is commonly employed by the prophets to indicate that the message was divinely commissioned. Cf. <a ref='Hosea 1:1'>Hos 1:1</a> ; <a ref='Micah 1:1'>Mic 1:1</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 1:1'>Zep 1:1</a> . Slightly varied forms are found in <a ref='1 Samuel 15:10'>1Sa 15:10</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 24:11'>2Sa 24:11</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 1:2'>Jer 1:2</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 1:3'>Eze 1:3</a> ; <a ref='Jonah 1:1'>Jon 1:1</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 1:1'>Zec 1:1</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 1:1'>Mal 1:1</a> . <b>Yahweh.</b> A distinctively Israelitish designation for God; the name speaks of intimacy and a relationship bonded metaphorically through the covenant likened to marriage and thus carries special significance to Israel ( <a ref='Exodus 3:14'>Ex 3:14</a> ). <b>Joel.</b> His name means “Yahweh is God.” <b>Pethuel.</b> His name means “openheartedness of/toward God” and is the only occurrence of this name in the Bible. <a ref='Joel 1:2–20'>1:2–20</a> The prophet described the contemporary day of Yahweh. The land was suffering massive devastation caused by a locust plague and drought. The details of the calamity (vv. <a ref='Joel 1:2–12'>2–12</a> ) are followed by a summons to communal penitence and reformation (vv. <a ref='Joel 1:13–20'>13–20</a> ). <a ref='Joel 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>Hear … give ear.</b> The gravity of the situation demanded the undivided focus of their senses, emphasizing the need to make a conscious, purposeful decision in the matter. The terminology was commonly used in “lawsuit” passages (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 1:2'>Is 1:2</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 4:1'>Hos 4:1</a> ), intimating that Israel was found guilty and that the present judgment was her “sentence.” <b>elders … all inhabitants.</b> The former term refers to the civil and religious leaders, who, in light of their position, were exhorted to lead by example the entire population toward repentance. <a ref='Joel 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>Recount … sons … next generation.</b> The pedagogical importance of reciting Yahweh’s mighty acts to subsequent generations is heavily underscored by the 3-fold injunction (cf. <a ref='Exodus 10:1–6'>Ex 10:1–6</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:9'>Dt 4:9</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:6–7'>6:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:19'>11:19</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:7'>32:7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 78:5–7'>Pss 78:5–7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 145:4–7'>145:4–7</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 4:1'>Pr 4:1ff.</a> ). <a ref='Joel 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>locust.</b> The 4 kinds of locusts refer to their species or their stages of development. Cf. <a ref='Joel 2:25'>2:25</a> , where the writer mentions them in different order. The total destruction caused by their voracious appetites demands repentance (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:38'>Dt 28:38</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 33:4'>Is 33:4</a> ; <a ref='Amos 7:1'>Am 7:1</a> ). <a ref='Joel 1:5–12'>1:5–12</a> Total destruction affected all social and economic levels. Affected were the drunkards who delighted in the abundance of the vine (vv. <a ref='Joel 1:5–7'>5–7</a> ), the priests who utilized the produce in the offerings (vv. <a ref='Joel 1:8–10'>8–10</a> ), and the farmers who planted, cultivated, and reaped the harvest (vv. <a ref='Joel 1:11–12'>11–12</a> ). As if building toward a crescendo, the prophet noted in the first stanza that the luxuries of life were withdrawn. In the second, the elements needed to worship were interrupted. In the third, the essentials for living were snatched away. To lose the enjoyment of wine was one thing; to no longer be able to outwardly worship God was another; but to have nothing to eat was the sentence of death! <a ref='Joel 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>Awake … weep … wail.</b> The drunkards were to awaken to the realization that their wine would be no more. They were to weep bitterly and to wail. The severity of the devastation called for public, communal mourning. <b>sweet wine.</b> The term can denote either freshly squeezed grape juice or newly fermented wine (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 49:26'>Is 49:26</a> ). <a ref='Joel 1:6–7'>1:6–7</a> <b>my land … vine … fig tree.</b> The possessive pronoun refers to Yahweh. He is the owner of the land (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 25:23'>Lv 25:23</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 36:2'>Nu 36:2</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 38:16'>Eze 38:16</a> ), the vine, and the fig tree (cf. <a ref='Hosea 2:9'>Hos 2:9</a> ). Instead of symbols of prosperity and peace ( <a ref='1 Kings 4:25'>1Ki 4:25</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:4'>Mic 4:4</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 3:10'>Zec 3:10</a> ), the vine and fig tree had become visual reminders of divine judgment. <a ref='Joel 1:6'>1:6</a> <b>a nation.</b> A literal invasion of locusts pictured the kind of destruction and judgment inflicted by human armies. <b>teeth of a lion.</b> Joel described these hostile, countless locusts as possessing the “fangs of a lioness,” so able were they to devour anything in their path. They are occasionally used as symbolic of violence ( <a ref='Genesis 49:9'>Ge 49:9</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 23:24'>Nu 23:24</a> ) and of the violent, awesome nature of God’s judgment ( <a ref='Isaiah 30:6'>Is 30:6</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 13:8'>Hos 13:8</a> ). <a ref='Joel 1:8–9'>1:8–9</a> The metaphor is significant because the OT speaks of Yahweh as the husband of Israel, His wife ( <a ref='Isaiah 54:5–8'>Is 54:5–8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 31:32'>Jer 31:32</a> ). The covenantal offerings and libations could not be carried out; Israel, the wife of Yahweh, was to repent, lest her relationship with Yahweh became like that of the young widowed maiden. <a ref='Joel 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>Wail like a virgin.</b> As with the drunkards, the religious leaders were to wail as a young maiden would upon the death of her youthful husband, wherein she exchanged the silky fabric of a wedding dress and the joy of a wedding feast for the scratchy, coarse clothing of goat’s hair and the cry of a funeral dirge. The term “virgin” lacks the notion of virginity in many cases (e.g., <a ref='Es 2:17'>Es 2:17</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 23:3'>Eze 23:3</a> ), and when coupled together with the term “bridegroom,” it points to a young maiden widowed shortly after marriage. <b>sackcloth.</b> Fabric generally made of goat’s hair, usually black or dark in color (cf. <a ref='Revelation 6:12'>Rev 6:12</a> ), and usually placed on the bare body around the hips ( <a ref='Genesis 37:34'>Ge 37:34</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 21:27'>1Ki 21:27</a> ), leaving the chest free for “beating” ( <a ref='Isaiah 32:11–12'>Is 32:11–12</a> ), was used in the ancient world to depict sorrow and penitence ( <a ref='Nehemiah 9:1'>Ne 9:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 37:1'>Is 37:1</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 11:21'>Mt 11:21</a> ). Because the prophets’ message usually dealt with a call to repentance, it became the principal garment worn by prophets ( <a ref='Matthew 3:4'>Mt 3:4</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:3'>Rev 11:3</a> ). <a ref='Joel 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>grain offering … drink offering are cut off.</b> To cut off these offerings, sacrificed each morning and evening ( <a ref='Exodus 29:38–42'>Ex 29:38–42</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 23:13'>Lv 23:13</a> ), was to cut off the people from the covenant. The gravity of the situation was deepened by the fact that it threatened the livelihood of the priests, who were given a portion of most sacrifices. <a ref='Joel 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>Be ashamed, O farmers.</b> The primary emphasis of the Hebrew term connotes a public disgrace, a physical state to which the guilty party has been forcibly brought. <a ref='Joel 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>All the trees … dry up.</b> The picture was bleak, for even the deep roots of the trees could not withstand the torturous treatment administered by the locusts, especially when accompanied by an extended drought. <b>rejoicing dries up.</b> Human joy and delight had departed from all segments of society; none had escaped the grasp of the locusts. The joy that normally accompanied the time of harvest had been replaced with despair. <a ref='Joel 1:14'>1:14</a> <b>Set apart a fast as holy.</b> The prophet called the priests to take action, first by example (v. <a ref='Joel 1:13'>13</a> ) and then by proclamation (v. <a ref='Joel 1:14'>14</a> ). As the official leaders, it was their duty to proclaim a public fast so that the entire nation could repent and petition Yahweh to forgive and restore. Here they were admonished to “set apart a fast as holy,” denoting its urgent, sacred character. <b>Proclaim a solemn assembly.</b> Directives for calling an assembly, generally for festive purposes (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 7:9'>2Chr 7:9</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 8:18'>Ne 8:18</a> ), are given in <a ref='Numbers 10:3'>Nu 10:3</a> . Parallel in thought to “set apart a fast as holy,” no work was permitted on such days ( <a ref='Leviticus 23:36'>Lv 23:36</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 29:35'>Nu 29:35</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:8'>Dt 16:8</a> ). <a ref='Joel 1:15'>1:15</a> <b>the day of Yahweh is near.</b> See Introduction: Historical and Theological Themes . This is the first occurrence of the theme. Later in the book ( <a ref='Joel 2:18'>2:18ff.</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:1'>3:1</a> , <a ref='Joel 3:18–21'>18–21</a> ), the day of Yahweh (the occasion when God pours out His wrath on man) results in blessing and exoneration for God’s people and judgment toward Gentiles ( <a ref='Isaiah 13:6'>Is 13:6</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 30:3'>Eze 30:3</a> ), but here Joel directs the warning toward his own people. The day of Yahweh is speedily approaching; unless sinners repent, dire consequences await them. <b>destruction from the Almighty.</b> The Hebrew term “destruction” forms a powerful play on words with the “Almighty.” The notion of invincible strength is foremost; destruction at the hand of omnipotent God is coming.

Though innocent, in judgment even the animals suffered (cf. <a ref='Romans 8:18–22'>Ro 8:18–22</a> ) the loss of food. <a ref='Joel 1:19'>1:19</a> <b>To You, O Yahweh, I cry.</b> As the first to call to repentance, the prophet had to be the first to heed the warning. He had to lead by example and motivate the people to respond. In the midst of proclaiming judgment, God’s prophets often led in intercessory prayer for mercy and forgiveness (cf. <a ref='Exodus 32:11–14'>Ex 32:11–14</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 42:1–4'>Jer 42:1–4</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:1–19'>Da 9:1–19</a> ; <a ref='Amos 7:1–6'>Am 7:1–6</a> ). <a ref='Joel 2:1–17'>2:1–17</a> With an increased level of intensity, Joel utilized the metaphor of the locust plague and drought as a backdrop from which to launch an intensified call to repent in view of the coming invasion of Judah and the day of Yahweh, present and future. <a ref='Joel 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>Blow a trumpet.</b> In the ancient world, horns were used to gather people for special occasions or to warn of danger ( <a ref='Exodus 19:13'>Ex 19:13</a> , <a ref='Exodus 19:16'>16</a> , <a ref='Exodus 19:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 20:18'>20:18</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 10:1–10'>Nu 10:1–10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 27:13'>Is 27:13</a> ; <a ref='Amos 3:6'>Am 3:6</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 1:14–16'>Zep 1:14–16</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 9:14'>Zec 9:14</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:16'>1Th 4:16</a> ). The term here refers to a ram’s horn. <b>day of Yahweh.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Joel 1:15'>1:15</a> .</i> Four Explicit Mentions of “Day of the Lord” in the New Testament 1. <a ref='Acts 2:20'>Acts 2:20</a> 2. <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:2'>1 Thessalonians 5:2</a> 3. <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:2'>2 Thessalonians 2:2</a> 4. <a ref='2 Peter 3:10'>2 Peter 3:10</a> Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Joel 2:2–11'>2:2–11</a> In dramatic and vivid language, Joel compared the drought and locusts to fire, horses, and an invading army. <a ref='Joel 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>darkness and thick darkness … clouds and dense gloom.</b> These features describe the blackness of a locust invasion, so thick that it blots out the sun with its deadly living cloud of insects. Such terms are also often common figures for misery and calamity in the OT ( <a ref='Isaiah 8:22'>Is 8:22</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:2'>60:2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 13:16'>Jer 13:16</a> ; <a ref='Amos 5:18'>Am 5:18</a> , <a ref='Amos 5:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 1:15'>Zep 1:15</a> ) and past visitations of Yahweh ( <a ref='Exodus 10:12'>Ex 10:12ff.</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 19:16–19'>19:16–19</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 24:16'>24:16</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:12'>Dt 4:12</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:22–23'>5:22–23</a> ). <a ref='Joel 2:4'>2:4</a> <b>Their appearance is like … horses.</b> The resemblance of the locust’s head to that of a horse is striking, so much so that the prophet reiterates the word “appearance.” Horses were not used for agricultural purposes in ancient times, but were the most feared military equipment ( <a ref='Exodus 15:1'>Ex 15:1ff.</a> , <a ref='Exodus 15:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:1'>Dt 20:1</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 11:4'>Jos 11:4</a> ). The simile continues with “as of chariots” (v. <a ref='Joel 2:5'>5</a> ); “like a mighty people” (v. <a ref='Joel 2:5'>5</a> ); “like mighty men” (v. <a ref='Joel 2:7'>7</a> ); and “like men of war” (v. <a ref='Joel 2:7'>7</a> ). <a ref='Joel 2:10'>2:10</a> <b>earth trembles … sun and the moon grow dark.</b> The ground trembles as dust flies along with the growing devastation. Earthquakes and cosmic disruptions are well attested elsewhere as signs accompanying divine appearances ( <a ref='Judges 5:4'>Jdg 5:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 18:7'>Ps 18:7</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 4:23–26'>Jer 4:23–26</a> ; <a ref='Nahum 1:5–6'>Na 1:5–6</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:7'>Mt 24:7</a> ). Joel later refers to these signs (cf. <a ref='Joel 2:31'>2:31</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:15'>3:15</a> ). <a ref='Joel 2:12–14'>2:12–14</a> Even in the midst of judgment, opportunity to repent was given. If they would demonstrate genuine repentance, Yahweh stood ready to forgive and bless. <a ref='Joel 2:16'>2:16</a> From oldest to youngest they were to come. The situation is so grave that even the groom and bride were exhorted to assemble (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:5'>Dt 24:5</a> ); consummation of the marriage could wait. <a ref='Joel 2:18–3:21'>2:18—3:21</a> With the advent of v. <a ref='Joel 2:18'>18</a> , the text makes a decisive transition, devoting the remainder of the book to restoration. It assumes an interval of time between v. <a ref='Joel 2:17'>17</a> and v. <a ref='Joel 2:18'>18</a> during which Israel repented. As a result of her repentance, the 3 major concerns of <a ref='Joel 1:1–2:17'>1:1—2:17</a> are answered by Yahweh: physical restoration ( <a ref='Joel 2:21–27'>2:21–27</a> ), spiritual restoration ( <a ref='Joel 2:28–32'>2:28–32</a> ), and national restoration ( <a ref='Joel 3:1–21'>3:1–21</a> ). <a ref='Joel 2:20'>2:20</a> <b>northern</b> military force. Although some have viewed this as a reference to the locusts, it is more likely referring to a military invasion by a country coming down from the north of Israel (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 38:6'>Eze 38:6</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 38:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 39:2'>39:2</a> ). That future army will be driven into the eastern sea (Dead Sea) and the western sea (Mediterranean Sea). <a ref='Joel 2:21–24'>2:21–24</a> Reminiscent of <a ref='Joel 1:18–20'>1:18–20</a> , the former situation had been reversed. The animals were admonished to be afraid no longer. <a ref='Joel 2:23–24'>2:23–24</a> <b>early and late rains.</b> The early rains came in Oct.–Dec. to prepare the seed-bed and assist germination, while the latter rains came in Mar.–May to provide ample moisture for the grain and fruit crops to be rich and full. <a ref='Joel 2:27'>2:27</a> <b>I am in the midst of Israel.</b> This return promised a reversal of Yahweh’s departure (cf. <a ref='Eze 8-11'>Eze 8–11</a> ). <a ref='Joel 2:28–32'>2:28–32</a> See Introduction: Interpretive Challenges ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Acts 2:16–21'>Ac 2:16–21</a></i> . <a ref='Joel 2:28'>2:28</a> <b>afterwards.</b> The abundance of material blessings would be followed by the outpouring of spiritual blessings. When coupled with the other temporal phrases within the passage (“in those days” [v. <a ref='Joel 2:29'>29</a> ] and “before the great and awesome day of Yahweh comes” [v. <a ref='Joel 2:31'>31</a> ]), the term points to a Second Advent fulfillment time frame. <b>all mankind.</b> Since the context is “your sons and your daughters,” “all mankind” best refers to the house of Israel only. The nations are the recipients of God’s wrath, not the effusion of His Spirit (cf. <a ref='Joel 3:2'>3:2</a> , <a ref='Joel 3:9'>9ff.</a> ). <a ref='Joel 2:30–31'>2:30–31</a> <b>Before … day of Yahweh.</b> Unmistakable heavenly phenomena will signal the imminent arrival of God’s wrath in the day of Yahweh (cf. v. <a ref='Joel 2:10'>10</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Joel 1:15'>1:15</a></i> ). <a ref='Joel 2:32'>2:32</a> <b>everyone who calls.</b> Quoted by Paul in <a ref='Romans 10:13'>Ro 10:13</a> . <b>survivors.</b> In spite of the nation’s sin, God promised to fulfill His unconditional covenants (Noahic, Abrahamic, Davidic, and New). A future remnant of Jews will inherit God’s promised blessings (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 10:20–22'>Is 10:20–22</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:11'>11:11</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 11:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 31:7'>Jer 31:7</a> ; <a ref='Micah 2:12'>Mic 2:12</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 3:13'>Zep 3:13</a> ; <a ref='Romans 9:27'>Ro 9:27</a> ). <a ref='Joel 3:1–21'>3:1–21</a> Joel notes the national restoration of Israel, in which the people will be regathered to Israel ( <a ref='Isaiah 11:15–16'>Is 11:15–16</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:31'>Mt 24:31</a> ). <a ref='Joel 3:2'>3:2</a> <b>gather all the nations.</b> The nations of the world will be gathered to Jerusalem to the battle of Armageddon ( <a ref='Zechariah 12:3'>Zec 12:3</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:2'>14:2</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:16'>Rev 16:16</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:11–21'>19:11–21</a> ). <b>valley of Jehoshaphat.</b> The name means “Yahweh judges” (cf. <a ref='Joel 3:12'>3:12</a> , <a ref='Joel 3:14'>14</a> ) and although the exact location is unknown, other prophets spoke of this judgment as occurring near Jerusalem ( <a ref='Eze 38-39'>Eze 38–39</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 11:45'>Da 11:45</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 9:14'>Zec 9:14ff.</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 12:1'>12:1ff.</a> ). This judgment of the nations includes the event of <a ref='Matthew 25:31–46'>Mt 25:31–46</a> . <a ref='Joel 3:5–6'>3:5–6</a> The exact historical event referred to here is uncertain. Slave trading was a common practice among the Phoenicians and Philistines. <a ref='Joel 3:6'>3:6</a> <b>the Greeks.</b> Although not prominent militarily, the Greeks were active in commerce on the Mediterranean in the 9th century BC. <a ref='Joel 3:7–8'>3:7–8</a> The reversal of fortunes will be startling. The victims themselves will be called upon to be the instruments and avengers of Yahweh’s wrath (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:12–14'>Is 11:12–14</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 12:8'>Zec 12:8</a> ). <a ref='Joel 3:8'>3:8</a> <b>Sabeans.</b> Trading merchants who lived in Arabia ( <a ref='1Ki 10'>1Ki 10</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 6:20'>Jer 6:20</a> ). <a ref='Joel 3:9–17'>3:9–17</a> Joel resumes the theme of vv. <a ref='Joel 3:1–3'>1–3</a> , the gathering of the nations to the earthly courtroom, the valley of Jehoshaphat. The sentence has been handed down and the Judge orders His agents to ready the scene for the execution. <a ref='Joel 3:14'>3:14</a> <b>valley of decision.</b> This location is the same as the valley of Jehoshaphat where the sentence of judgment will be carried out (cf. <a ref='Joel 3:2'>3:2</a> , <a ref='Joel 3:12'>12</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Joel 3:2'>3:2</a> .</i> <a ref='Joel 3:15–16'>3:15–16</a> <b>sun … moon … stars.</b> Cf. <a ref='Joel 2:10'>2:10</a> , <a ref='Joel 2:30–31'>30–31</a> . These are signs that precede the coming eschatological day of Yahweh at the end of the Great Tribulation (cf. <a ref='Matthew 24:29–30'>Mt 24:29–30</a> ). <a ref='Joel 3:17'>3:17</a> <b>Zion, My holy mountain.</b> This will be the earthly location of God’s presence in the millennial temple (cf. <a ref='Eze 40-48'>Eze 40–48</a> ) at Jerusalem. <b>will pass through it no more.</b> God has promised a future time when His glory in Judah will not be eclipsed. This time of ultimate peace and prosperity will be experienced after Christ conquers the world and sets up His millennial kingdom on earth (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:24–28'>Eze 37:24–28</a> ; <a ref='Mt 24-25'>Mt 24–25</a> ; <a ref='Rev 19'>Rev 19</a> ). <a ref='Joel 3:18'>3:18</a> <b>valley of Shittim.</b> Known for its acacia trees, the valley was situated on the northern shores of the Dead Sea and served as the final stopover for Israel prior to her entrance into the Promised Land ( <a ref='Numbers 25:1'>Nu 25:1</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 2:1'>Jos 2:1</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 3:1'>3:1</a> ).
