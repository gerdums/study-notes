    "content": "The Book of Obadiah Title The book is named after the prophet who received the vision ( <a ref='Obadiah 1:1'>1:1</a> ). Obadiah means “servant of the Lord” and occurs 20 times in the OT, referring to many other OT individuals. Obadiah is the shortest book in the OT and is not quoted in the NT. Author and Date Nothing is known for certain about the author. Other OT references to men of this name do not appear to be referring to this prophet. His frequent mentions of Jerusalem, Judah, and Zion suggest that he belonged to the southern kingdom (cf. vv. <a ref='Obadiah 1:10–12'>10–12</a> , <a ref='Obadiah 1:17'>17</a> , <a ref='Obadiah 1:21'>21</a> ). Obadiah was probably a contemporary of Elijah and Elisha. The date of writing is equally difficult to determine, though we know it is tied to the Edomite assault on Jerusalem described in vv. <a ref='Obadiah 1:10–14'>10–14</a> . Obadiah apparently wrote shortly after the attack. There were 4 significant invasions of Jerusalem in OT history: 1) by Shishak, king of Egypt, ca. 925 BC during the reign of Rehoboam ( <a ref='1 Kings 14:25–26'>1Ki 14:25–26</a> ; <a ref='2Ch 12'>2Chr 12</a> ); 2) by the Philistines and Arabians between 848–841 BC during the reign of Jehoram of Judah ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 21:8–20'>2Chr 21:8–20</a> ); 3) by Jehoash, king of Israel, ca. 790 BC ( <a ref='2Ki 14'>2Ki 14</a> ; <a ref='2Ch 25'>2Chr 25</a> ); and 4) by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Of these 4, only the second and the fourth are possible fits with historical data. Number two is preferable, since Obadiah’s description does not indicate the total destruction of the city, which took place under Nebuchadnezzar’s attack. Also, although the Edomites were involved in Nebuchadnezzar’s destruction of Jerusalem ( <a ref='Ps 137'>Ps 137</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 4:21'>Lam 4:21</a> ), it is significant that Obadiah does not mention the Babylonians by name (as with all the other prophets who wrote about Jerusalem’s fall), nor is there any reference to the destruction of the temple or the deportation of the people; in fact, the captives appear to have been taken to the southwest, not east to Babylon (cf. v. <a ref='Obadiah 1:20'>20</a> ). Background and Setting The Edomites trace their origin to Esau, the firstborn (twin) son of Isaac and Rebekah ( <a ref='Genesis 25:24–26'>Ge 25:24–26</a> ), who struggled with Jacob even while in the womb ( <a ref='Genesis 25:22'>Ge 25:22</a> ). Esau’s name means “hairy,” because he was “all over like a hairy garment” ( <a ref='Genesis 25:25'>Ge 25:25</a> ). He is also called Edom, meaning “red,” owing to the sale of his birthright in exchange for some red stew ( <a ref='Genesis 25:30'>Ge 25:30</a> ). He showed a disregard for the covenant promises by marrying two Canaanite women ( <a ref='Genesis 26:34'>Ge 26:34</a> ) and later the daughter of Ishmael ( <a ref='Genesis 28:9'>Ge 28:9</a> ). He loved the out-of-doors and, after having his father’s blessing stolen from him by Jacob, was destined to remain a man of the open spaces ( <a ref='Genesis 25:27'>Ge 25:27</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 27:38–40'>27:38–40</a> ). Esau settled in a region of mostly rugged mountains south of the Dead Sea ( <a ref='Genesis 33:16'>Ge 33:16</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 36:8–9'>36:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:4–5'>Dt 2:4–5</a> ) called Edom (Greek, “Idumea”), the 4-mi. wide area which stretches approximately 100 mi. south to the Gulf of Aqabah. The famed King’s Highway, an essential caravan route linking North Africa with Europe and Asia, passes along the eastern plateau ( <a ref='Numbers 20:17'>Nu 20:17</a> ). The struggle and birth of Jacob and Esau ( <a ref='Ge 25'>Ge 25</a> ) form the ultimate background to the prophecy of <a ref='Genesis 25:23'>Ge 25:23</a> , “two nations are in your womb.” Their respective descendants, Israel and Edom, were perpetual enemies. When Israel came out from Egypt, Edom denied their brother Jacob passage through their land, located south of the Dead Sea ( <a ref='Numbers 20:14–21'>Nu 20:14–21</a> ). Nevertheless, Israel was instructed by God to be kind to Edom ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:7–8'>Dt 23:7–8</a> ). Obadiah, having received a vision from God, was sent to describe their crimes and to pronounce total destruction upon Edom because of their treatment of Israel. The Edomites opposed Saul (ca. 1043–1011 BC) and were subdued under David (ca. 1011–971 BC) and Solomon (ca. 971–931 BC). They fought against Jehoshaphat (ca. 873–848 BC) and successfully rebelled against Jehoram (ca. 853–841 BC). They were again conquered by Judah under Amaziah (ca. 796–767 BC), but they regained their freedom during the reign of Ahaz (ca. 735–715 BC). Edom was later controlled by Assyria and Babylon; and in the fifth century BC the Edomites were forced by the Nabateans to leave their territory. They moved to the area of southern Israel and became known as Idumeans. Herod the Great, an Idumean, became king of Judea under Rome in 37 BC. In a sense, the enmity between Esau and Jacob was continued in Herod’s attempt to murder Jesus. The Idumeans participated in the rebellion of Jerusalem against Rome and were defeated along with the Jews by Titus in AD 70. Ironically, the Edomites applauded the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC (cf. <a ref='Psalms 137:7'>Ps 137:7</a> ) but died trying to defend it in AD 70. After that time they were never heard of again. As Obadiah predicted, they would be “cut off forever” (v. <a ref='Obadiah 1:10'>10</a> ); and there would be “no survivor of the house of Esau” (v. <a ref='Obadiah 1:18'>18</a> ). Historical and Theological Themes Obadiah is a case study of the curses/blessings in <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> , with two interrelated themes: 1) the judgment of Edom by God for cursing Israel. This was apparently told to Judah, thereby providing reassurance that the Lord would bring judgment upon Edom for her pride and for her participation in Judah’s downfall; 2) Judah’s restoration. This would even include the territory of the Edomites (vv. <a ref='Obadiah 1:19–21'>19–21</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:14'>Is 11:14</a> ). Obadiah’s blessing for Judah includes the near fulfillment of Edom’s demise (vv. <a ref='Obadiah 1:1–14'>1–14</a> ), and the far fulfillment of the nations’ judgment and Israel’s final possession of Edom (vv. <a ref='Obadiah 1:15–21'>15–21</a> ). Interpretive Challenges The striking similarity between <a ref='Obadiah 1:1–9'>Ob 1–9</a> and <a ref='Jeremiah 49:7–22'>Jer 49:7–22</a> brings up the question: Who borrowed from whom? Assuming there was not a third common source, it appears that Jeremiah borrowed, where appropriate, from Obadiah, since the shared verses form one unit in Obadiah, while in Jeremiah they are scattered among other verses.

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Obadiah 1:1'>1</a> <b>The vision.</b> The prophetic word often came from God in the form of a vision (cf. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:1'>Hab 1:1</a> ). <b>Thus says Yahweh Yahweh.</b> Although the background of the prophet is obscure, the source of his message is not. It was supernaturally given by God, and was not motivated by unholy vengeance. <b>Edom.</b> Descendants of Esau ( <a ref='Genesis 25:30'>Ge 25:30</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 36:1'>36:1ff.</a> ), the Edomites settled in the region south of the Dead Sea. See Introduction: Background and Setting . <b>arise against her.</b> The prophet heard of a God-ordained international plot to overthrow Edom. The selfish motives of Edom’s enemies were divinely controlled by Yahweh’s “envoy” to serve His sovereign purposes (cf. <a ref='Psalms 104:4'>Ps 104:4</a> ). <a ref='Obadiah 1:3'>3</a> <b>the clefts of the cliff.</b> Dwelling in difficult mountain terrain, Edom’s imposing, impregnable capital city of Petra was virtually inaccessible, giving her a sense of security and self-sufficiency. Deep, terrifying gorges emanating from peaks reaching 5,700 ft. surrounded her like a fortress, generating a proud, false sense of security. <a ref='Obadiah 1:3–4'>3–4</a> <b>Who will bring me down. … will bring you down.</b> Edom’s pride was answered decisively by the Sovereign Ruler (cf. <a ref='Matthew 23:12'>Mt 23:12</a> ). The calamity against Edom, though brought about by her enemies, was truly God’s judgment of her pride (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 16:18'>Pr 16:18</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:12'>1Co 10:12</a> ). <a ref='Obadiah 1:5'>5</a> <b>robbers by night.</b> Because of the rugged terrain and very narrow access through the gorges, predatory attack could only come at night. <a ref='Obadiah 1:5–6'>5–6</a> Edom’s attackers, by divine judgment, would not stop where normal thieves would when they have enough. Instead, they would leave nothing. <a ref='Obadiah 1:7'>7</a> Those conspiring against Edom (v. <a ref='Obadiah 1:1'>1</a> ) were her allies (“men <i>who have</i> a covenant with you”), her neighbors (“men at peace with you”), and even the outlying tribes who benefited from Edom’s prosperity (“ <i>They who eat</i> your bread”). <a ref='Obadiah 1:8'>8</a> <b>wise men.</b> Edom was known for her wise men and sages ( <a ref='Jeremiah 49:7'>Jer 49:7</a> ). Her location on the King’s Highway provided her with intellectual stimulation with India, Europe, and North Africa. <a ref='Obadiah 1:9'>9</a> <b>Teman.</b> A name derived from a descendant of Esau ( <a ref='Genesis 36:11'>Ge 36:11</a> ), it refers to a region in the northern part of Edom which was the home of Job’s friend, Eliphaz ( <a ref='Job 4:1'>Job 4:1</a> ). <a ref='Obadiah 1:10'>10</a> <b>violence to … Jacob.</b> Edom’s opposition is in view, which began as Israel approached the land (cf. <a ref='Numbers 20:14–21'>Nu 20:14–21</a> ) and continued to Habakkuk’s day. “Slaughter” (v. <a ref='Obadiah 1:9'>9</a> ) and shame for Edom will be just retribution for Edom’s violence and slaughter against her brother’s people. <a ref='Obadiah 1:11–14'>11–14</a> The charge of v. <a ref='Obadiah 1:10'>10</a> is here amplified: 1) they “stood aloof,” withholding assistance (v. <a ref='Obadiah 1:11'>11</a> ); 2) they rejoiced over Judah’s downfall (v. <a ref='Obadiah 1:12'>12</a> ; cf. <a ref='Psalms 83:4–6'>Pss 83:4–6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 137:4–6'>137:4–6</a> ); 3) they plundered the city (v. <a ref='Obadiah 1:13'>13</a> ); and 4) they prevented the escape of her fugitives (v. <a ref='Obadiah 1:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Obadiah 1:15'>15</a> <b>day of Yahweh.</b> God’s near judgment of Edom in history (vv. <a ref='Obadiah 1:1–14'>1–14</a> ) was a preview of His far judgment on all nations (vv. <a ref='Obadiah 1:15–16'>15–16</a> ) who refuse to bow to His sovereignty (cf. discussion of “Day of Yahweh” in Introduction to Joel ). God’s Judgment on Edom More than any other nation mentioned in the OT, Edom is the supreme object of God’s wrath. • <a ref='Psalms 83:5–18'>Pss 83:5–18</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 137:7'>137:7</a> • <a ref='Ezekiel 25:12–14'>Eze 25:12–14</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 35:1–15'>35:1–15</a> • <a ref='Isaiah 11:14'>Is 11:14</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 21:11–12'>21:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 34:5'>34:5</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 63:1–6'>63:1–6</a> • <a ref='Joel 3:19'>Joel 3:19</a> • <a ref='Jeremiah 49:7–22'>Jer 49:7–22</a> • <a ref='Amos 1:11–12'>Am 1:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Amos 9:11–12'>9:11–12</a> • <a ref='Lamentations 4:21–22'>Lam 4:21–22</a> • <a ref='Malachi 1:2–5'>Mal 1:2–5</a> Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Obadiah 1:16'>16</a> <b>My holy mountain.</b> Zion, referring to Jerusalem (cf. v. <a ref='Obadiah 1:17'>17</a> ). <b>drink and swallow.</b> Compare <a ref='Zechariah 12:2'>Zec 12:2</a> , where Yahweh will make His people as a “cup that causes reeling” from which His enemies will be made to drink. This refers to the cup of God’s wrath. Judah drank temporarily of judgment, Edom will drink “continually.” <a ref='Obadiah 1:17'>17</a> A reversal of Judah’s plight in vv. <a ref='Obadiah 1:10–14'>10–14</a> will come about when Messiah intercedes and establishes His millennial kingdom and holiness prevails. <a ref='Obadiah 1:18–20'>18–20</a> Those of Judah who remain (v. <a ref='Obadiah 1:14'>14</a> ) will be divinely empowered to “consume” (v. <a ref='Obadiah 1:18'>18</a> ) and completely wipe out the “house of Esau” (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:14'>Is 11:14</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 34:5–17'>34:5–17</a> ). When Messiah sets up His kingdom, the boundaries of the Davidic and Solomonic kingdoms will once again expand to include that promised to Jacob in his dream at Bethel ( <a ref='Genesis 28:14'>Ge 28:14</a> ) which reaffirmed God’s promise to Abraham (cf. <a ref='Ge 12'>Ge 12</a> ). This would include the south (mountains of Esau); the west (Philistia); the north (Ephraim … Samaria); and the east (Gilead). <a ref='Obadiah 1:18'>18</a> <b>house of Jacob … house of Joseph.</b> Representatives of Abraham’s descendants. <a ref='Obadiah 1:20'>20</a> <b>Canaanites.</b> Those peoples who occupied the land before the Exodus. <b>Zarephath.</b> Also known as Sarepta (cf. <a ref='Luke 4:26'>Lk 4:26</a> ), this town was located on the Phoenician coast between Tyre and Sidon. <b>Sepharad.</b> Not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, the location is uncertain. Most rabbis identify it with Spain; others have suggested Sparta or Sardis. <a ref='Obadiah 1:21'>21</a> <b>saviors will ascend … to judge.</b> Just as Yahweh raised up judges to deliver His people (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 9:27'>Ne 9:27</a> ), so will He establish similar leaders to help rule in the millennial kingdom (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:2'>1Co 6:2</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:4'>Rev 20:4</a> ). <b>the kingdom will belong to Yahweh.</b> When the nations are judged in the day of Yahweh, He will then set up His millennial kingdom, a theocracy in which He rules His people directly on earth ( <a ref='Zechariah 14:4–9'>Zec 14:4–9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:15'>Rev 11:15</a> ).",
