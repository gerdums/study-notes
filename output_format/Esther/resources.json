    "content": "The Book of Esther Title “Esther” serves as the title without variation through the ages. This book and the book of Ruth are the only OT books named after women. Like Song of Songs, Obadiah, and Nahum, the NT does not quote or allude to Esther. “Hadassah” ( <a ref='Es 2:7'>2:7</a> ), meaning “myrtle,” was the Hebrew name of Esther, which came either from the Persian word “star” or possibly from the name of the Babylonian love goddess, Ishtar. As the orphaned daughter of her father Abihail, Esther grew up in Persia with her older cousin, Mordecai, who raised her as if she were his own daughter ( <a ref='Es 2:7'>2:7</a> , <a ref='Es 2:15'>15</a> ). Author and Date The author remains unknown, although Mordecai, Ezra, and Nehemiah have been suggested. Whoever penned Esther possessed a detailed knowledge of Persian customs, etiquette, and history, plus particular familiarity with the palace at Shushan ( <a ref='Es 1:5–7'>1:5–7</a> ). He also exhibited intimate knowledge of the Hebrew calendar and customs, while additionally showing a strong sense of Jewish nationalism. Possibly a Persian Jew, who later moved back to Israel, wrote Esther. Esther appears as the 17th book in the literary chronology of the OT and closes the OT historical section. Only <a ref='Ezr 7-10'>Ezr 7–10</a> , Nehemiah, and Malachi report later OT history than Esther. The account in Esther ends in 473 BC before Ahasuerus died by assassination (ca. 465 BC). <a ref='Es 10:2'>Esther 10:2</a> speaks as though Ahasuerus’ reign has been completed, so the earliest possible writing date would be after his reign around mid-fifth century BC. The latest reasonable date would be prior to 331 BC when Greece conquered Persia. Background and Setting Esther occurred during the Persian period of world history, ca. 539 BC ( <a ref='Daniel 5:30–31'>Da 5:30–31</a> ) to ca. 331 BC ( <a ref='Daniel 8:1–27'>Da 8:1–27</a> ). Ahasuerus ruled from ca. 486 to 465 BC; Esther covers the 483–473 BC portion of his reign. The name Ahasuerus represents the Hebrew transliteration of the Persian name “Khshayarsha,” while “Xerxes” represents his Greek name. The events of Esther occurred during the wider time span between the first return of the Jews after the 70-year captivity in Babylon ( <a ref='Daniel 9:1–19'>Da 9:1–19</a> ) under Zerubbabel ca. 538 BC ( <a ref='Ezr 1-6'>Ezr 1–6</a> ) and the second return led by Ezra ca. 458 BC ( <a ref='Ezr 7-10'>Ezr 7–10</a> ). Nehemiah’s journey (the third return) from Susa to Jerusalem ( <a ref='Ne 1-2'>Ne 1–2</a> ) occurred later (ca. 445 BC). Esther and Exodus both chronicle how vigorously foreign powers tried to eliminate the Jewish race and how God sovereignly preserved His people in accordance with His covenant promise to Abraham ca. 2100–2075 BC ( <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 17:1–8'>17:1–8</a> ). As a result of God’s prevailing, <a ref='Es 9-10'>Es 9–10</a> records the beginning of Purim—a new annual festival in the 12th month (Feb.–Mar.) to celebrate the nation’s survival. Purim became one of two festivals given outside of the Mosaic legislation to still be celebrated in Israel (Hanukkah, or the Festival of Lights, is the other, cf. <a ref='John 10:22'>Jn 10:22</a> ). Historical and Theological Themes All 167 verses of Esther have ultimately been accepted as canonical, although the absence of God’s name anywhere has caused some to unnecessarily doubt its authenticity. The Greek Septuagint (LXX) added an extra 107 apocryphal verses which supposedly compensated for this lack. Along with Song of Songs, Ruth, Ecclesiastes, and Lamentations, Esther stands with the OT books of the Megilloth, or “5 scrolls.” Rabbis read these books in the synagogue on 5 special occasions during the year—Esther being read at Purim (cf. <a ref='Es 9:20–32'>9:20–32</a> ). The historical genesis for the drama played out between Mordecai (a Benjamite descendant of Saul— <a ref='Es 2:5'>2:5</a> ) and Haman (an Agagite— <a ref='Es 3:1'>3:1</a> , <a ref='Es 3:10'>10</a> ; <a ref='Es 8:3'>8:3</a> , <a ref='Es 8:5'>5</a> ; <a ref='Es 9:24'>9:24</a> ) goes back almost 1,000 years when the Jews exited from Egypt (ca. 1445 BC) and were attacked by the Amalekites ( <a ref='Exodus 17:8–16'>Ex 17:8–16</a> ), whose lineage began with Amalek, grandson of Esau ( <a ref='Genesis 36:12'>Ge 36:12</a> ). God pronounced His curse on the Amalekites, which resulted in their total elimination as a people ( <a ref='Exodus 17:14'>Ex 17:14</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:17–19'>Dt 25:17–19</a> ). Although Saul (ca. 1030 BC) received orders to kill all the Amalekites, including their king Agag ( <a ref='1 Samuel 15:2–3'>1Sa 15:2–3</a> ), he disobeyed ( <a ref='1 Samuel 15:7–9'>1Sa 15:7–9</a> ) and incurred God’s displeasure ( <a ref='1 Samuel 15:11'>1Sa 15:11</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 15:26'>26</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 28:18'>28:18</a> ). Samuel finally hacked Agag into pieces ( <a ref='1 Samuel 15:32–33'>1Sa 15:32–33</a> ). Because of his lineage from Agag, Haman carried deep hostility toward the Jews. The time of Esther arrived 550 years after the death of Agag, but in spite of such passage of time, neither Haman the Agagite nor Mordecai the Benjamite had forgotten the tribal feud that still smoldered in their souls. This explains why Mordecai refused to bow down to Haman ( <a ref='Es 3:2–3'>3:2–3</a> ) and why Haman so viciously attempted to exterminate the Jewish race ( <a ref='Es 3:5–6'>3:5–6</a> , <a ref='Es 3:13'>13</a> ). As expected, God’s prophecy to extinguish the Amalekites ( <a ref='Exodus 17:14'>Ex 17:14</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:17–19'>Dt 25:17–19</a> ) and God’s promise to preserve the Jews ( <a ref='Genesis 17:1–8'>Ge 17:1–8</a> ) prevailed. Because of God’s faithfulness to save His people, the festival of Purim (named after the Akkadian word for “lot”— <a ref='Es 3:7'>3:7</a> ; <a ref='Es 9:26'>9:26</a> ), an annual, two-day holiday of feasting, rejoicing, sending food to one another, and giving gifts to the poor ( <a ref='Es 9:21–22'>9:21–22</a> ), was decreed to be celebrated in every generation, by every family, in every province and city ( <a ref='Es 9:27–28'>9:27–28</a> ). Esther later added a new feature of fasting with lamentation ( <a ref='Es 9:31'>9:31</a> ). Purim is not biblically mentioned again, although it has been celebrated throughout the centuries in Israel. Esther could be compared to a chess game. God and Satan (as invisible players) moved real kings, queens, and nobles. When Satan put Haman into place, it was as if he announced “Check.” God then positioned Esther and Mordecai in order to put Satan into “Checkmate!” Ever since the fall of man ( <a ref='Genesis 3:1–19'>Ge 3:1–19</a> ), Satan has attempted to spiritually sever God’s relationship with His human creation and disrupt God’s covenant promises with Israel. For example, Christ’s line through the tribe of Judah had been murderously reduced to Joash alone, who was rescued and preserved ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 22:10–12'>2Chr 22:10–12</a> ). Later, Herod slaughtered the infants of Bethlehem, thinking Christ was among them ( <a ref='Matthew 2:16'>Mt 2:16</a> ). Satan tempted Christ to denounce God and worship him ( <a ref='Matthew 4:9'>Mt 4:9</a> ). Peter, at Satan’s insistence, tried to block Christ’s journey to Calvary ( <a ref='Matthew 16:22'>Mt 16:22</a> ). Finally, Satan entered into Judas who then betrayed Christ to the Jews and Romans ( <a ref='Luke 22:3–6'>Lk 22:3–6</a> ). While God was not mentioned in Esther, He was everywhere apparent as the One who opposed and foiled Satan’s diabolical schemes by providential intervention. In Esther, all of God’s unconditional covenant promises to Abraham ( <a ref='Genesis 17:1–8'>Ge 17:1–8</a> ) and to David ( <a ref='2 Samuel 7:8–16'>2Sa 7:8–16</a> ) were jeopardized. However, God’s love for Israel is nowhere more apparent than in this dramatic rescue of His people from pending elimination. “Behold, He who keeps Israel will not slumber and will not sleep” ( <a ref='Psalms 121:4'>Ps 121:4</a> ). Interpretive Challenges The most obvious question raised by Esther comes from the fact that God is nowhere mentioned, as in Song of Songs. Nor does the writer or any participant refer to the law of God, the Levitical sacrifices, worship, or prayer. The skeptic might ask, “Why would God never be mentioned when the Persian king receives over 175 references? Since God’s sovereignty prevailed to save the Jews, why does He then not receive appropriate recognition?” It seems satisfying to respond that if God desired to be mentioned, He could just as sovereignly have moved the author to write of Him as He acted to save Israel. This situation seems to be more of a problem at the human level than the divine, because Esther is the classic illustration of God’s providence as He, the unseen power, controls everything for His purpose. There are no miracles in Esther, but the preservation of Israel through providential control of every event and person reveals the omniscience and omnipotence of Jehovah. Whether He is named is not the issue. He is clearly the main character in the drama. Second, “Why were Mordecai and Esther so secular in their lifestyles?” Esther ( <a ref='Es 2:6–20'>2:6–20</a> ) does not seem to have the zeal for holiness like Daniel ( <a ref='Daniel 1:8–20'>Da 1:8–20</a> ). Mordecai kept his and Esther’s Jewish heritage secret, unlike Daniel ( <a ref='Daniel 6:5'>Da 6:5</a> ). The law of God was absent in contrast to Ezra ( <a ref='Ezra 7:10'>Ezr 7:10</a> ). Nehemiah had a heart for Jerusalem that seemingly eluded the affections of Esther and Mordecai ( <a ref='Nehemiah 1:1–2:5'>Ne 1:1—2:5</a> ). The following observations help to shed some light on these issues. First, this short book does not record everything. Perhaps Mordecai and Esther actually possessed a deeper faith than becomes apparent here (cf. <a ref='Es 4:16'>4:16</a> ). Second, even godly Nehemiah did not mention his God when talking to King Artaxerxes ( <a ref='Nehemiah 2:1–8'>Ne 2:1–8</a> ). Third, the Jewish festivals which provided structure for worship had been lost long before Esther, e.g., Passover ( <a ref='2 Kings 23:22'>2Ki 23:22</a> ) and Booths ( <a ref='Nehemiah 8:17'>Ne 8:17</a> ). Fourth, possibly the anti-Jewish letter written by the Samaritans to Ahasuerus several years earlier had frightened them (ca. 486 BC; <a ref='Ezra 4:6'>Ezr 4:6</a> ). Fifth, the evil intentions of Haman did not just first surface when Mordecai refused to bow down ( <a ref='Es 3:1–2'>3:1–2</a> ). Most likely they were long before shared by others which would have intimidated the Jewish population. Sixth, Esther did identify with her Jewish heritage at a most appropriate time ( <a ref='Es 7:3–4'>7:3–4</a> ). And yet, the nagging question of why Esther and Mordecai did not seem to have the same kind of open devotion to God as did Daniel remains. Further, Nehemiah’s prayer ( <a ref='Nehemiah 1:5–11'>Ne 1:5–11</a> , esp. v. <a ref='Nehemiah 1:7'>7</a> ) seems to indicate a spiritual lethargy among the Jewish exiles in Susa. So this issue must ultimately be resolved by God since He alone knows human hearts. Outline I. Esther Replaces Vashti ( <a ref='Es 1:1–2:18'>1:1—2:18</a> ) A.

This probably included the planning phase for Ahasuerus’ later campaign against Greece in which the king suffered a humiliating defeat (ca. 481–479 BC). <b>Persia and Media.</b> Cyrus the Persian inherited Media and thus the name Media became just as prominent as Persia (ca. 550 BC). <a ref='Es 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>Queen Vashti.</b> Greek literature records her name as Amestris.

He was among the fourth generation of deported Jews. <b>Kish.</b> Mordecai’s great grandfather who actually experienced the Babylonian deportation. After Babylon fell to Medo-Persia (ca. 539 BC), Jews were moved to other parts of the new kingdom. Kish represents a Benjamite family name that could be traced back (ca. 1100 BC) to Saul’s father ( <a ref='1 Samuel 9:1'>1Sa 9:1</a> ). <a ref='Es 2:6'>2:6</a> <b>Jeconiah.</b> Former king of Judah (also known as Jehoiachin and Coniah) who was deported ca. 597 BC (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 24:14–15'>2Ki 24:14–15</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:9–10'>2Chr 36:9–10</a> ). Due to his disobedience, Yahweh removed his descendants from the line of David to Christ ( <a ref='Jeremiah 22:24–30'>Jer 22:24–30</a> ).

At exactly the proper moment, God providentially intervened so that the king suffered insomnia, called for the book of records, read of Mordecai’s unrewarded deeds 5 years past, and then desired to reward him (cf. <a ref='Daniel 6:18'>Da 6:18</a> ). <a ref='Es 6:4'>6:4</a> <b>Who is in the court?</b> The drama intensified as Haman arrived at just the wrong time and for just the wrong reason. <a ref='Es 6:6–7'>6:6–7</a> Haman ironically defined the honor to be given to Mordecai at Haman’s expense. To his potential wealth from the Jewish plunder, he thought public acclaim would be added. <a ref='Es 6:8'>6:8</a> <b>royal robe … royal crown.</b> An honor which involved being treated as though the recipient were the king himself (cf. <a ref='Es 8:15'>8:15</a> ).

One, he manipulated the king in planning to kill the queen’s people. Two, he was perceived to accost the queen. Three, he planned to execute a man whom the king had just greatly honored for extreme loyalty to the kingdom. <a ref='Es 7:10'>7:10</a> <b>they hanged Haman.</b> The ultimate expression of justice (cf. <a ref='Psalms 9:15–16'>Ps 9:15–16</a> ). <a ref='Es 8:1'>8:1</a> <b>the house of Haman.</b> Property of a traitor by Persian custom returned to the king. In this case, he gave it to his queen, Esther, who put Mordecai over it ( <a ref='Es 8:2'>8:2</a> ). The outcome for Haman’s wife Zeresh and his wise men is unknown ( <a ref='Es 5:14'>5:14</a> ; <a ref='Es 6:12–13'>6:12–13</a> ). Haman’s 10 sons later died ( <a ref='Es 9:7–10'>9:7–10</a> ). <a ref='Es 8:5'>8:5</a> <b>to turn back.</b> This proved to be impossible in light of the inflexible nature of the king’s edicts ( <a ref='Es 1:19'>1:19</a> ). However, a counter-decree was possible (cf. <a ref='Es 8:8'>8:8</a> , <a ref='Es 8:11–12'>11–12</a> ). <a ref='Es 8:9'>8:9</a> <b>Sivan.</b> Refers to the period May/June. It had been two months and 10 days since Haman’s decree (cf. <a ref='Es 3:12'>3:12</a> ); 8 months and 20 days remained until both decrees became simultaneously effective (cf. <a ref='Es 3:13'>3:13</a> ). <a ref='Es 8:11'>8:11</a> <b>the king gave.</b> Just as the king had permitted Haman, so he allowed the Jews to defend themselves and to plunder their spoil (cf. <a ref='Es 9:10'>9:10</a> , <a ref='Es 9:15–16'>15–16</a> ). <a ref='Es 8:15'>8:15</a> <b>Mordecai went out.</b> This second reward exceeded the first (cf. <a ref='Es 6:6–9'>6:6–9</a> ).

Here is a powerful statement with regard to God’s providential preservation of the Jewish race in harmony with God’s unconditional promise to Abraham ( <a ref='Genesis 17:1–8'>Ge 17:1–8</a> ). This providential deliverance stands in contrast to God’s miraculous deliverance of the Jews from Egypt; yet in both cases the same end had been accomplished by the supernatural power of God. <a ref='Es 9:3'>9:3</a> <b>the dread of Mordecai.</b> Pragmatically, the nation had a change of heart toward the Jews, knowing that the king, the queen, and Mordecai were the ranking royal officials of the land. To be pro-Jewish would put one in favor with the king and his court and put one on the side of God, the ultimate King (cf. <a ref='Revelation 19:16'>Rev 19:16</a> ). <a ref='Es 9:6–7'>9:6–7</a> Five hundred men died in Susa. <a ref='Es 9:10'>9:10</a> <b>did not send forth their hand.</b> Unlike Saul, who did take the plunder (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 15:3'>1Sa 15:3</a> with <a ref='1 Samuel 15:9'>15:9</a> ), the Jews focused only on the mission at hand, i.e., to preserve the Jewish race (cf. vv. <a ref='Es 9:15–16'>15–16</a> ), even though the king’s edict permitted this ( <a ref='Es 8:11'>8:11</a> ). <a ref='Es 9:12'>9:12</a> <b>further request?</b> Even this pagan king served the cause of utterly blotting out the Amalekites in accord with God’s original decree ( <a ref='Exodus 17:14'>Ex 17:14</a> ) by allowing for a second day of killing in Susa to eliminate all Jewish enemies. <a ref='Es 9:13'>9:13</a> <b>be hanged.</b> I.e., be publicly displayed. <a ref='Es 9:15–16'>9:15–16</a> Over 1,500 years earlier God had promised to curse those who curse Abraham’s descendants ( <a ref='Genesis 12:3'>Ge 12:3</a> ). <a ref='Es 9:15'>9:15</a> <b>fourteenth day.</b> Another 300 men died the second day of killing in Susa, bringing the total dead in Susa to 810. <a ref='Es 9:16'>9:16</a> <b>kill.</b> Outside of Susa, only one day of killing occurred in which 75,000 enemies died. <a ref='Es 9:18–19'>9:18–19</a> This section recounted why Purim would be celebrated for two days rather than one. <a ref='Es 9:20–25'>9:20–25</a> A brief summary of God’s providential intervention on behalf of the Jews. <a ref='Es 9:26'>9:26</a> <b>Purim.</b> The first and last biblically revealed, non-Mosaic festival with perpetual significance. <a ref='Es 9:29'>9:29</a> <b>second letter.</b> An additional letter (cf. v. <a ref='Es 9:20'>20</a> for the first letter), which added “fasting” and “lamentations” to the prescribed activity of Purim. <a ref='Es 9:32'>9:32</a> <b>written in the book.</b> This could be the chronicle referred to in <a ref='Es 10:2'>10:2</a> , or another archival type document.
