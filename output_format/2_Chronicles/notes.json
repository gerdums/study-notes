Fearing such an alliance would present future danger to Israel, Josiah decided to intercept Pharaoh Neco’s army and fight to protect his nation. Coming from Egypt, likely by ship to Acco, a northern seaport in Israel, and by land up the coastal plain of Israel, the Egyptian army had landed and proceeded east to the plain of Megiddo (v. 22 ), i.e., Jezreel on the plain of Esdraelon.
