Among these, Pss 32 and 51 stand out as confessional giants. As historically related to the life of David and especially in connection with the Bathsheba episode (cf. 2Sa 11–12 ), Ps 51 would have preceded Ps 32 . The overall thrust, intent, and development of Ps 32 may be summarized as follows: Life’s most important lessons about sin, confession, and forgiveness are skillfully shared by David through two avenues of approach."

One of its major lessons is that “you really can’t take it with you.” Containing these kinds of very practical lessons about life and death, it falls neatly into the category of a didactic or wisdom poem. At places it sounds very much like portions of Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes. It contains warnings to the rich and famous and words of comfort for the poor. These timeless OT messages undergird many NT passages, such as the accounts about the rich fool in Lk 12:13–21 or the rich man and Lazarus in Lk 16 . After a fairly lengthy introduction the body of the psalm falls into two parts as indicated by the climaxing refrain in vv. 12 and 20 . The wisdom poet of Ps 49 developed his somber theme in two stages, focusing on death as the universal experience of all men."

Probably it was the former, given 1) the nature of the Egyptian Hallel (esp. Ps 114 ); 2) its use by the Jewish community especially at Passover; 3) the close similarity to Moses’ experience in the Exodus; 4) the striking similarity in language ( Ps 118:14 with Ex 15:2 ; 118:15–16 with Ex 15:6 , 12 ; 118:28 with Ex 15:2 ); and 5) the particularly pointed messianic significance as it relates to the redemption provided by Christ our Passover ( 1Co 5:7 ).
