See Introduction . a slave and apostle. Peter identifies himself with a balance of humility and dignity. As a servant, he was on equal basis with other Christians—an obedient slave of Christ. As an apostle, he was unique, divinely called, and commissioned as an eyewitness to the resurrection of Christ ( see notes on Ro 1:1 ). To those.

It can mean “attaining by divine will.” Here, Peter was emphasizing that salvation was not attained by personal effort, skill, or worthiness, but came purely from God’s grace. faith. Peter is speaking of a subjective faith, i.e., the Christian’s power to believe for his salvation. Faith is the capacity to believe ( Eph 2:8–9 ). Even though faith and belief express the human side of salvation, God still must grant that faith. God initiates faith when the Holy Spirit awakens the dead soul in response to hearing the Word of God (cf. Ac 11:21 ; Eph 2:8 ; Php 1:2 ). the same kind of. Generally the Greek word which is translated “the same kind” was used to designate equal in rank, position, honor, standing, price, or value. It was used in the ancient world with strangers and foreigners who were given equal citizenship in a city. Here, Peter was emphasizing that Christians have all received the same priceless saving faith. There are no first- and second-class Christians in spiritual, racial, or gender distinctions (cf. Ga 3:28 ). Since Peter was writing to mostly Gentiles, he may have been emphasizing that they have received the same faith as the Jews (cf. Ac 10:44–48 ; 11:17–18 ). by the righteousness. Peter’s point is that believers share the equal gift of salvation because God’s righteousness is imputed to them. That righteousness recognizes no distinction between people except that the sins of some are more heinous than others. So, not only do they have faith because God gives it to them, they are saved only because God imputes righteousness to them ( see notes on Ro 3:26 ; 4:5 ; 2Co 5:21 ; Php 3:8–9 ). our God and Savior, Jesus Christ. The Greek construction has only one article before this phrase, making the entire phrase refer to the same person. Thus, Peter is identifying Jesus Christ as both Savior and God (cf. Is 43:3 , 11 ; 45:15 , 21 ; 60:16 ; Ro 9:5 ; Col 2:9 ; Tit 2:13 ; Heb 1:8 )."

Throughout Scripture, it implies an intimate knowledge ( Am 3:2 ). The knowledge of Christ emphasized here is not a superficial knowledge, or a mere surface awareness of the facts about Christ, but a genuine, personal sharing of life with Christ, based on repentance from sin and personal faith in Him (cf. Mt 7:21 ). called us by His own glory and excellence. This call, as always when mentioned in the NT Epistles, is the effectual call to salvation (cf. 1Pe 1:15 ; 2:21 ; 5:10 ; see note on Ro 8:30 ). This saving call is based on the sinner’s understanding of Christ’s revealed majesty and moral excellence evidencing that He is Lord and Savior. This implies that there must be a clear presentation of Christ’s person and work as the God-Man in evangelism, which attracts men to salvation (cf. 1Co 2:1–2 ). The cross and resurrection most clearly reveal His “glory and excellence.”"

Since there is only one definite article with this phrase, the meaning is “the powerful coming,” or “the coming in power.” The false teachers who were opposing Peter had tried to debunk the doctrine of the second coming of Christ (see 3:3–4 ) about which Peter had spoken and written ( 1Pe 1:3–7 , 13 ; 4:13 ). cleverly devised myths. “Myths” were mythical stories about gods and miracles (cf. 1Ti 1:4 ; 4:7 ; 2Ti 4:4 ; Tit 1:14 ). Realizing that false leaders and their followers would try to discredit this letter, and that he was probably already being accused of concocting tales and myths in order to get people to follow him so he could amass wealth, power, and prestige as false teachers were motivated to do, Peter gave evidences in the following verses to prove that he wrote the truth of God as a genuinely inspired writer. eyewitnesses of His majesty. The “we” that begins this verse refers to the apostles. In one sense, all of the apostles had been eyewitnesses to Christ’s majesty, especially His miracles, resurrection body, and ascension into heaven.

The kingdom splendor of Christ revealed at this event was intended as a preview of His majesty to be manifested at His second coming (cf. Mt 16:28 ; see notes on 17:1–6 ). The Transfiguration was a glimpse of the glory to be unveiled at the final revelation, the apocalypse of Christ ( Rev 1:1 ).

The “prophetic word” refers not just to the OT major and minor prophets, but to the entire OT. Of course, all of the OT was written by “prophets” in the truest sense, since they spoke and wrote God’s Word, which was the task of a prophet, and they looked forward, in some sense, to the coming Messiah (cf. Lk 24:27 ). as more sure. This translation could indicate that the eyewitness account of Christ’s majesty at the Transfiguration confirmed the Scriptures. However, the Greek word order is crucial in that it does not say that. It says, “And we have more sure the prophetic word.” That original arrangement of the sentence supports the interpretation that Peter is ranking Scripture over experience. The prophetic word (Scripture) is more complete, more permanent, and more authoritative than the experience of anyone. More specifically, the Word of God is a more reliable verification of the teachings about the person, atonement, and second coming of Christ than even the genuine firsthand experiences of the apostles themselves. you do well to pay attention. Peter was warning believers that since they would be exposed to false teachers, they must pay careful attention to Scripture. a lamp shining in a dark place.

Ps 119:105 ; Jn 17:17 ). the day dawns and the morning star arises. These simultaneous images mark the parousia , i.e., the appearing of Jesus Christ (cf. Lk 1:78 ; Rev 2:28 ; 22:16 ). in your hearts. The second coming will have not only an externally transforming impact on the universe ( 3:7–13 ), but also an internally transforming impact on those believers who are alive when Jesus returns, forever removing any of their remaining doubts. The perfect, but limited, revelation of the Scriptures will be replaced with the perfect and complete revelation of Jesus Christ at the second coming (cf. Jn 14:7–11 ; 21:25 ). Then the Scriptures will have been fulfilled; and believers, made like Christ ( 1Jn 3:1–2 ), will have perfect knowledge and all prophecy will be abolished ( see note on 1Co 13:8–10 )."

Peter’s point is not so much about how to interpret Scripture, but rather how Scripture originated, and what its source was. The false prophets untied and loosed their own ideas.

Grammatically, this means that they were continually carried or borne along by the Spirit of God (cf. Lk 1:70 ; Ac 27:15 , 17 ). The Holy Spirit thus is the divine author and originator, the producer of the Scriptures. In the OT alone, the human writers refer to their writings as the words of God over 3800 times (e.g., Jer 1:4 ; cf. 3:2 ; Ro 3:2 ; 1Co 2:10 ). Though the human writers of Scripture were active rather than passive in the process of writing Scripture, God the Holy Spirit superintended them so that, using their own individual personalities, thought processes, and vocabulary, they composed and recorded without error the exact words God wanted written. The original copies of Scripture are therefore inspired, i.e., God-breathed (cf. 2Ti 3:16 ) and inerrant, i.e., without error ( Jn 10:34–35 ; 17:17 ; Tit 1:2 ).

Peter described false teachers in detail in this chapter so that Christians would always recognize their characteristics and methods. The greatest sin of Christ-rejecters and the most damning work of Satan is misrepresentation of the truth and its consequent deception. Nothing is more wicked than for someone to claim to speak for God to the salvation of souls when in reality he speaks for Satan to the damnation of souls (cf. Dt 13:1–18 ; 18:20 ; Jer 23 ; Eze 13 ; Mt 7:15 ; 23:1–36 ; 24:4–5 ; Ro 16:17 ; 2Co 11:13–14 ; Ga 3:1–2 ; 2Ti 4:3–4 ). among the people. “The people” is used in the NT of Israel (cf. Ac 26:17 , 23 ). Peter’s point, though, is that Satan has always endeavored to infiltrate groups of believers with the deceptions of false teachers (cf. Jn 8:44 ). Since Eve, he has been in the deceit business ( see notes on 2Co 11:3–4 ). secretly introduce destructive heresies. The false teachers parade themselves as Christian pastors, teachers, and evangelists (cf. Jd 4 ). “Heresies” means self-designed religious lies which lead to division and faction (cf. 1Co 11:19 ; Ga 5:20 ). The Greek word for “destructive” basically means damnation. This word is used 6 times in this letter and always speaks of final damnation (vv. 1–3 ; 3:7 , 16 ). This is why it is so tragic when a church makes a virtue out of the toleration of unscriptural teachings and ideas in the name of love and unity (see 2Th 3:14 ; 1Ti 4:1–5 ; Tit 3:9–11 ). denying the Master. This phrase exposes the depth of the crime and guilt of the false teachers. This unusual Greek word for “Master” or “Lord” appears 10 times in the NT and means one who has supreme authority, whether human authority or divine authority. Peter here warns that false prophets deny the sovereign lordship of Jesus Christ. Though their heresies may include the denial of the virgin birth, deity, bodily resurrection, and second coming of Christ, the false teachers’ basic error is that they will not submit their lives to the rule of Christ. All false religions have an erroneous Christology. who bought them. The terms which Peter used here are more analogical than theological, speaking of a human master over a household. The master bought slaves, and the slaves owed the master allegiance as their sovereign. (For an OT parallel, see Dt 32:5–6 , where God is said to have bought Israel, though they rejected Him.) Doctrinally, this analogy can be viewed as responsibility for submission to God which the false teachers had refused. Beyond this, they are probably claiming that they were Christians, so that the Lord had bought them actually and personally. With some sarcasm, Peter mocks such a claim by writing of their coming damnation. Thus, the passage is describing the sinister character of the false teachers who claim Christ, but deny His lordship over their lives. swift destruction. This refers to either physical death or judgment at the return of Christ ( Pr 29:1 ; 2Th 1:7–10 )."

Lest anyone think that God is too loving and merciful to judge the wicked false teachers and their deceived people, Peter gives 3 powerful illustrations of past divine judgment on the wicked.

The Greeks taught that tartarus was a place lower than Hades reserved for the most wicked of human beings, gods, and demons. The Jews eventually came to use this term to describe the place where fallen angels were sent. It defined for them the lowest hell, the deepest pit, the most terrible place of torture and eternal suffering.

God has an immense capacity for patience before He breaks forth in judgment (cf. v. 15 ; Joel 2:13 ; Lk 15:20 ; Ro 9:22 ; 1Pe 3:15 ).

The “Day of the Lord” is a technical term pointing to the special interventions of God in human history for judgment.

Is 2:10–21 ; 13:6–22 ; Joel 1–2 ; Am 5 ; Ob 15 ; Zec 14 ; Mal 4 ; 2Th 1:7 ; 2:2 ).

The “heavens” refer to the physical universe. The “roar” connotes a whistling or a crackling sound as of objects being consumed by flames. God will incinerate the universe, probably in an atomic reaction that disintegrates all matter as we know it (vv. 7 , 11–13 ). the elements will be destroyed with intense heat. The “elements” are the atomic components into which matter is ultimately divisible, which make up the composition of all the created matter. Peter means that the atoms, neutrons, protons, and electrons are all going to disintegrate (v. 11 ). the earth and its works. The whole of the physical, natural earth in its present form, with its entire universe will be consumed. Cf. Is 24:19–20 ; 34:4 ."

One of the motives for holy conduct and godliness is expectation. “Hastening” means “eagerly desiring” that something will happen. Christians are not to fear the future day of God, but eagerly hope for it (cf. 1Co 1:7 ; 16:22 ; 1Jn 2:28 ; 3:3 ). the day of God. The “day of God” is not the same as the “Day of the Lord.” The “day of God” refers to the eternal state, in preparation of which the heavens and the earth are burned up and the new creation is made. It is likely so named because of what Paul had in mind in 1Co 15:28 , the eternal glory of the new creation, with God being all in all. When the day of God comes, man’s “day” will be over. The corrupting of the universe by man and Satan will have been terminated and judged, finally and forever. the heavens … will be destroyed. See notes on vv. 7 , 10–11 . The new world in which righteousness dwells (v. 13 ) requires the Lord to first destroy the old, sin-cursed universe (cf. Ro 8:19–22 )."

This is one of the most clear-cut statements in the Bible to affirm that the writings of Paul are Scripture. Peter’s testimony is that Paul wrote Scripture, but the false teachers distorted it. The NT apostles were aware that they spoke and wrote the Word of God ( 1Th 2:13 ) as surely as did the OT prophets. Peter realized that the NT writers brought the divine truth that completed the Bible ( 1Pe 1:10–12 ). to their own destruction. The fact that distorting Paul’s writings leads to eternal damnation proves that Paul’s writings were inspired of God."

Such a call for glory to Christ demonstrates again that Peter considered Jesus Christ to be deity, equal in honor with God the Father (cf. 1:1 ; Jn 5:23 )."
