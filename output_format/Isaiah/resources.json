    "content": "The Book of Isaiah Title The book derives its title from the author, whose name means “The Lord is salvation,” and is similar to the names Joshua, Elisha, and Jesus. Isaiah is quoted directly in the NT over 65 times, far more than any other OT prophet, and mentioned by name over 20 times. Author and Date Isaiah, the son of Amoz, ministered in and around Jerusalem as a prophet to Judah during the reigns of 4 kings of Judah: Uzziah (called “Azariah” in 2 Kings), Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah ( <a ref='Isaiah 1:1'>1:1</a> ), from ca. 739–686 BC. He evidently came from a family of some rank, because he had easy access to the king ( <a ref='Isaiah 7:3'>7:3</a> ). He was married and had two sons who bore symbolic names: “Shear-jashub” (“a remnant shall return,” <a ref='Isaiah 7:3'>7:3</a> ) and “Maher-shalal-hash-baz” (“hasting to the spoil, hurrying to the prey,” <a ref='Isaiah 8:3'>8:3</a> ). When called by God to prophesy, in the year of King Uzziah’s death (ca. 739 BC), he responded with a cheerful readiness, though he knew from the beginning that his ministry would be one of fruitless warning and exhortation ( <a ref='Isaiah 6:9–13'>6:9–13</a> ). Having been reared in Jerusalem, he was an appropriate choice as a political and religious counselor to the nation. Isaiah was a contemporary of Hosea and Micah. His writing style has no rival in its versatility of expression, brilliance of imagery, and richness of vocabulary. The early church father Jerome likened him to Demosthenes, the legendary Greek orator. His writing features a range of 2,186 different words, compared to 1,535 in Ezekiel, 1,653 in Jeremiah, and 2,170 in the Psalms. <a ref='2 Chronicles 32:32'>Second Chronicles 32:32</a> records that he wrote a biography of King Hezekiah also. The prophet lived until at least 681 BC when he penned the account of Sennacherib’s death (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 37:38'>37:38</a> ). Tradition has it that he met his death under King Manasseh (ca. 695–642 BC) by being cut in two with a wooden saw (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 11:37'>Heb 11:37</a> ). Background and Setting During Uzziah’s prosperous 52 year reign (ca. 790–739 BC), Judah developed into a strong commercial and military state with a port for commerce on the Red Sea and the construction of walls, towers, and fortifications ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 26:3–5'>2Chr 26:3–5</a> , <a ref='2 Chronicles 26:8–10'>8–10</a> , <a ref='2 Chronicles 26:13–15'>13–15</a> ). Yet the period witnessed a decline in Judah’s spiritual status. Uzziah’s downfall resulted from his attempt to assume the privileges of a priest and burn incense on the altar ( <a ref='2 Kings 15:3–4'>2Ki 15:3–4</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 26:16–19'>2Chr 26:16–19</a> ). He was judged with leprosy, from which he never recovered ( <a ref='2 Kings 15:5'>2Ki 15:5</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 26:20–21'>2Chr 26:20–21</a> ). His son Jotham (ca. 750–731 BC) had to take over the duties of king before his father’s death. Assyria began to emerge as a new international power under Tiglath-Pileser (ca. 745–727 BC) while Jotham was king ( <a ref='2 Kings 15:19'>2Ki 15:19</a> ). Judah also began to incur opposition from Israel and Syria to her north during his reign ( <a ref='2 Kings 15:37'>2Ki 15:37</a> ). Jotham was a builder and a fighter like his father, but spiritual corruption still existed in the Land ( <a ref='2 Kings 15:34–35'>2Ki 15:34–35</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 27:1–2'>2Chr 27:1–2</a> ). Ahaz was 25 when he began to reign in Judah and he reigned until age 41 ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 28:1'>2Chr 28:1</a> , <a ref='2 Chronicles 28:8'>8</a> ; ca. 735–715 BC). Israel and Syria formed an alliance to combat the rising Assyrian threat from the east, but Ahaz refused to bring Judah into the alliance ( <a ref='2 Kings 16:5'>2Ki 16:5</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 7:6'>Is 7:6</a> ). For this, the northern neighbors threatened to dethrone him, and war resulted (734 BC). In panic, Ahaz sent to the Assyrian king for help ( <a ref='2 Kings 16:7'>2Ki 16:7</a> ) and the Assyrian king gladly responded, sacking Gaza, carrying all of Galilee and Gilead into captivity, and finally capturing Damascus (732 BC). Ahaz’s alliance with Assyria led to his introduction of a heathen altar, which he set up in Solomon’s temple ( <a ref='2 Kings 16:10–16'>2Ki 16:10–16</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 28:3'>2Chr 28:3</a> ). During his reign (722 BC), Assyria captured Samaria, capital of the northern kingdom, and carried many of Israel’s most capable people into captivity ( <a ref='2 Kings 17:6'>2Ki 17:6</a> , <a ref='2 Kings 17:24'>24</a> ). Hezekiah began his reign over Judah in 715 BC and continued for 29 years to ca. 686 BC ( <a ref='2 Kings 18:1–2'>2Ki 18:1–2</a> ). Reformation was a priority when he became king ( <a ref='2 Kings 18:4'>2Ki 18:4</a> , <a ref='2 Kings 18:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 30:1'>2Chr 30:1</a> ). The threat of an Assyrian invasion forced Judah to promise heavy tribute to that eastern power. In 701 BC Hezekiah became very ill with a life-threatening disease, but he prayed and God graciously extended his life for 15 years ( <a ref='2Ki 20'>2Ki 20</a> ; <a ref='Is 38'>Is 38</a> ) until 686 BC. The ruler of Babylon used the opportunity of his illness and recovery to send congratulations to him, probably seeking to form an alliance with Judah against Assyria at the same time ( <a ref='2 Kings 20:12'>2Ki 20:12</a> ff.; <a ref='Is 39'>Is 39</a> ). When Assyria became weak through internal strife, Hezekiah refused to pay any further tribute to that power ( <a ref='2 Kings 18:7'>2Ki 18:7</a> ). So in 701 BC Sennacherib, the Assyrian king, invaded the coastal areas of Israel, marching toward Egypt on Israel’s southern flank. In the process he overran many Judean towns, looting and carrying many people back to Assyria. While besieging Lachish, he sent a contingent of forces to besiege Jerusalem ( <a ref='2 Kings 18:17–19:8'>2Ki 18:17—19:8</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 36:2–37:8'>Is 36:2—37:8</a> ). The side-expedition failed, however, so in a second attempt he sent messengers to Jerusalem demanding an immediate surrender of the city ( <a ref='2 Kings 19:9'>2Ki 19:9ff.</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 37:9'>Is 37:9ff.</a> ). With Isaiah’s encouragement, Hezekiah refused to surrender, and when Sennacherib’s army fell prey to a sudden disaster, he returned to Nineveh and never threatened Judah again. Historical and Theological Themes Isaiah prophesied during the period of the divided kingdom, directing the major thrust of his message to the southern kingdom of Judah. He condemned the empty ritualism of his day (e.g., <a ref='Isaiah 1:10–15'>1:10–15</a> ) and the idolatry into which so many of the people had fallen (e.g., <a ref='Isaiah 40:18–20'>40:18–20</a> ). He foresaw the coming Babylonian captivity of Judah because of this departure from the Lord ( <a ref='Isaiah 39:6–7'>39:6–7</a> ). Fulfillment of some of his prophecies in his own lifetime provided his credentials for the prophetic office. Sennacherib’s effort to take Jerusalem failed, just as Isaiah had said it would ( <a ref='Isaiah 37:6–7'>37:6–7</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 37:36–38'>36–38</a> ). The Lord healed Hezekiah’s critical illness, as Isaiah had predicted ( <a ref='Isaiah 38:5'>38:5</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 20:7'>2Ki 20:7</a> ). Long before Cyrus, king of Persia, appeared on the scene, Isaiah named him as Judah’s deliverer from the Babylonian captivity ( <a ref='Isaiah 44:28'>44:28</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 45:1'>45:1</a> ). Fulfillment of his prophecies of Christ’s first coming have given Isaiah further vindication (e.g., <a ref='Isaiah 7:14'>7:14</a> ). The pattern of literal fulfillment of his already-fulfilled prophecies gives assurance that prophecies of Christ’s second coming will also see literal fulfillment. Isaiah provides data on the future day of the Lord and the time following. He details numerous aspects of Israel’s future kingdom on earth not found elsewhere in the OT or NT, including changes in nature, the animal world, Jerusalem’s status among the nations, the Suffering Servant’s leadership, and others. Through a literary device called “prophetic foreshortening,” Isaiah predicted future events without delineating exact sequences of the events or time intervals separating them. For example, nothing in Isaiah reveals the extended period separating the two comings of the Messiah. Also, he does not provide as clear a distinction between the future temporal kingdom and the eternal kingdom as John does in <a ref='Revelation 20:1–10'>Rev 20:1–10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 21:1–22:5'>21:1—22:5</a> . In God’s program of progressive revelation, details of these relationships awaited a prophetic spokesman of a later time. Also known as the “evangelical Prophet,” Isaiah spoke much about the grace of God toward Israel, particularly in his last 27 chapters. The centerpiece is Isaiah’s unrivaled chap. <a ref='Is 53'>53</a> , portraying Christ as the slain Lamb of God. Interpretive Challenges Interpretive challenges in a long and significant book such as Isaiah are numerous. The most critical of them focuses on whether Isaiah’s prophecies will receive literal fulfillment or not, and on whether the Lord, in His program, has abandoned national Israel and permanently replaced the nation with the church, so that there is no future for national Israel. On the latter issue, numerous portions of Isaiah support the position that God has not replaced ethnic Israel with an alleged “new Israel.” Isaiah has too much to say about God’s faithfulness to Israel, that He would not reject the people whom He has created and chosen ( <a ref='Isaiah 43:1'>43:1</a> ). The nation is on the palms of His hands, and Jerusalem’s walls are ever before His eyes ( <a ref='Isaiah 49:16'>49:16</a> ). He is bound by His own Word to fulfill the promises He has made to bring them back to Himself and bless them in that future day ( <a ref='Isaiah 55:10–12'>55:10–12</a> ). On the former issue, literal fulfillment of many of Isaiah’s prophecies has already occurred, as illustrated in Introduction: Historical and Theological Themes . To contend that those yet unfulfilled will see nonliteral fulfillment is biblically groundless. This fact disqualifies the case for proposing that the church receives some of the promises made originally to Israel. The kingdom promised to David belongs to Israel, not the church. The future exaltation of Jerusalem will be on earth, not in heaven. Christ will reign personally on this earth as we know it, as well as in the new heavens and new earth ( <a ref='Revelation 22:1'>Rev 22:1</a> , <a ref='Revelation 22:3'>3</a> ). Outline I.

Instead of responding to God’s ultimate care and provision for them, these people have failed to give Him the loving obedience that is His due. <a ref='Isaiah 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>heavens … earth.</b> God intended Israel to be a channel of blessing to the nations ( <a ref='Isaiah 19:24–25'>19:24–25</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 42:6'>42:6</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 12:2–3'>Ge 12:2–3</a> ), but instead He must call the nations to look on Israel’s shame. <b>Sons.</b> The physical descendants of Abraham are God’s chosen people, in spite of their disobedience (cf. <a ref='Genesis 18:18–19'>Ge 18:18–19</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>ox … donkey.</b> Animals appear to have more powers of reason than God’s people who break fellowship with Him. <a ref='Isaiah 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>the Holy One of Israel.</b> This is Isaiah’s special title for God, found 25 times in this book ( <a ref='Isaiah 1:4'>1:4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 5:19'>5:19</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 5:24'>24</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 10:20'>10:20</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 12:6'>12:6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 17:7'>17:7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 29:19'>29:19</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 30:11–12'>30:11–12</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 30:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 31:1'>31:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 37:23'>37:23</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 41:14'>41:14</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 41:16'>16</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 41:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 43:3'>43:3</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 43:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 45:11'>45:11</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 47:4'>47:4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 48:17'>48:17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 49:7'>49:7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 54:5'>54:5</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 55:5'>55:5</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:9'>60:9</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 60:14'>14</a> ), but only 6 times in the rest of the OT ( <a ref='2 Kings 19:22'>2Ki 19:22</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 71:22'>Pss 71:22</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 78:41'>78:41</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:18'>89:18</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 50:29'>Jer 50:29</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 51:5'>51:5</a> ). Isaiah also uses “Holy One” as a title 4 times ( <a ref='Isaiah 10:17'>10:17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 40:25'>40:25</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 43:15'>43:15</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 49:7'>49:7</a> ) and “Holy One of Jacob” once ( <a ref='Isaiah 29:23'>29:23</a> ). In many contexts the name contrasts the holiness of God with the sinfulness of Israel. <a ref='Isaiah 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>Where … stricken again…?</b> Already in ruins because of rebellion against God (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 1:7–8'>7–8</a> ), the nation behaved irrationally by continuing their rebellion. <a ref='Isaiah 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>daughter of Zion.</b> The phrase occurs 28 times in the OT, 6 of which are in Isaiah ( <a ref='Isaiah 1:8'>1:8</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 10:32'>10:32</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 16:1'>16:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 37:22'>37:22</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 52:2'>52:2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 62:11'>62:11</a> ). It is a personification of Jerusalem, standing in this case for all of Judah. <a ref='Isaiah 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>Yahweh of hosts.</b> Isaiah used this title or the similar “Lord Yahweh of hosts” 60 times. It pictured God as a mighty warrior, a leader of armies, capable of conquering all of Israel’s enemies and providing for her survival. <b>survivors.</b> Sometimes rendered “remnant,” this term designated the faithful among the Israelites. Paul cited this verse to prove the ongoing existence of faithful Israelites even in his day ( <a ref='Romans 9:29'>Ro 9:29</a> ). Such a remnant will constitute the nucleus of returning Israelites in the nation’s regathering when the Messiah returns to earth. See <a ref='Isaiah 10:20'>10:20</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 10:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 1:10–11'>Hos 1:10–11</a> . <b>Sodom … Gomorrah.</b> In destroying them, God rained brimstone and fire on these two Canaanite cities because of their aggravated sinfulness ( <a ref='Genesis 18:20'>Ge 18:20</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 19:24–25'>19:24–25</a> , <a ref='Genesis 19:28'>28</a> ). The two thereby became a proverbial expression for the ultimate in God’s temporal judgment against any people (e.g., <a ref='Isaiah 13:19'>13:19</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:23'>Dt 29:23</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:14'>Jer 23:14</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 49:18'>49:18</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 50:40'>50:40</a> ; <a ref='Amos 4:11'>Am 4:11</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 2:9'>Zep 2:9</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 10:15'>Mt 10:15</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 2:6'>2Pe 2:6</a> ; <a ref='Jude 1:7'>Jd 7</a> ). Had God’s grace not intervened, He would have judged Israel in the same way. <a ref='Isaiah 1:10–17'>1:10–17</a> The prophet applied the names of the sinful cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, to Judah and Jerusalem in decrying their empty formalism in worship. God found their activities utterly repulsive when they engaged in the rituals prescribed by Moses, because when doing so they persisted in iniquity. <a ref='Isaiah 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>I have had enough. … take no pleasure.</b> Cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 15:22–23'>1Sa 15:22–23</a> . God found all sacrifices meaningless and even abhorrent if the offerer failed in obedience to His laws. Rebellion is equated to the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness to iniquity and idolatry. <a ref='Isaiah 1:13–14'>1:13–14</a> <b>New moon and sabbath, the calling of convocation … appointed times.</b> These were all occasions prescribed by the law of Moses (cf. <a ref='Exodus 12:16'>Ex 12:16</a> ; <a ref='Le 23'>Lv 23</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 10:10'>Nu 10:10</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 28:11–29:40'>28:11—29:40</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:1–17'>Dt 16:1–17</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 1:14'>1:14</a> <b>My soul hates.</b> It is impossible to doubt Yahweh’s total aversion toward hypocritical religion. Other practices God hates include robbery for burnt offering ( <a ref='Isaiah 61:8'>61:8</a> ), serving other gods ( <a ref='Jeremiah 44:4'>Jer 44:4</a> ), harboring evil against a neighbor and love for a false oath ( <a ref='Zechariah 8:16'>Zec 8:16</a> ), divorce ( <a ref='Malachi 2:16'>Mal 2:16</a> ), and the one who loves violence ( <a ref='Psalms 11:5'>Ps 11:5</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 1:16–17'>1:16–17</a> <b>Remove the evil … Seek justice.</b> The outward evidence of the emptiness of Jerusalem’s ritualism was the presence of evil works and the absence of good works. <a ref='Isaiah 1:17'>1:17</a> <b>the orphan … the widow.</b> Illustrative of good works are deeds done on behalf of those in need (v. <a ref='Isaiah 1:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:17–18'>Dt 10:17–18</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 14:29'>14:29</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:17'>24:17</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:19–21'>19–21</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:12–13'>26:12–13</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 27:19'>27:19</a> ; <a ref='James 1:27'>Jas 1:27</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 1:18–20'>1:18–20</a> In developing His call for cleanliness in v. <a ref='Isaiah 1:16'>16</a> , Yahweh pardoned the guilty who desire forgiveness and obedience. This section previews the last 27 chapters of Isaiah, which focus more on grace and forgiveness than on judgment. <a ref='Isaiah 1:18'>1:18</a> <b>scarlet … crimson.</b> The two colors speak of the guilt of those whose hands were “covered with blood” (v. <a ref='Isaiah 1:15'>15</a> ). Being covered with blood speaks of extreme iniquity and perversity (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 59:3'>59:3</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 9:9–10'>Eze 9:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 23:37'>23:37</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 23:45'>45</a> ). <b>white as snow … like wool.</b> Snow and wool are substances that are naturally white, and therefore portray what is clean, the blood-guilt (v. <a ref='Isaiah 1:15'>15</a> ) having been removed (cf. <a ref='Psalms 51:7'>Ps 51:7</a> ). Isaiah was a prophet of grace, but forgiveness is not unconditional. It comes through repentance as v. <a ref='Isaiah 1:19'>19</a> indicates. <a ref='Isaiah 1:19–20'>1:19–20</a> <b>are willing and obey … refuse and rebel.</b> The prophet offered his readers the same choice God gave Moses in <a ref='De 28'>Dt 28</a> , a choice between a blessing and a curse. They may choose repentance and obedience and reap the benefits of the land or refuse to do so and become victims of foreign oppressors. <b>eat … be eaten.</b> To accentuate the opposite outcomes, Yahweh used the same Hebrew word to depict both destinies. On one hand, they may eat the fruit of the land; on the other, they may be eaten by conquering powers. <a ref='Isaiah 1:21–31'>1:21–31</a> Verses <a ref='Isaiah 1:21–23'>21–23</a> recount Jerusalem’s current disobedience, with an account of God’s actions to purge her in vv. <a ref='Isaiah 1:24–31'>24–31</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 1:21'>1:21</a> <b>harlot.</b> Often in the OT, spiritual harlotry pictured the idolatry of God’s people (e.g., <a ref='Jeremiah 2:20'>Jer 2:20</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 3:1'>3:1</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 2:2'>Hos 2:2</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 3:1'>3:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 16:22–37'>Eze 16:22–37</a> ). In this instance, however, Jerusalem’s unfaithfulness incorporated a wider range of wrongs, including murders and general corruption (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 1:21'>21</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 1:23'>23</a> ). <b>justice … Righteousness.</b> As Isaiah prophesied, ethical depravity had replaced the city’s former virtues. <a ref='Isaiah 1:24'>1:24</a> <b>Yahweh, Yahweh of hosts, The Mighty One of Israel.</b> These titles of God emphasized His role as the rightful judge of His sinful people. “The Mighty One of Israel” occurs only here in the Bible, though “the Mighty One of Jacob” appears 5 times ( <a ref='Isaiah 49:26'>49:26</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:16'>60:16</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 49:24'>Ge 49:24</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 132:2'>Ps 132:2</a> , <a ref='Psalms 132:5'>5</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 1:25–26'>1:25–26</a> <b>I will … smelt away. … will have…return.</b> God’s judgment of His people has future restoration as its goal. They were subsequently restored from the Babylonian captivity ( <a ref='Jeremiah 29:10'>Jer 29:10</a> ), but this promise has in view a greater and more lasting restoration. It anticipates a complete and permanent restoration, which will make Jerusalem supreme among the nations ( <a ref='Jeremiah 3:17'>Jer 3:17</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 5:5'>Eze 5:5</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:2'>Mic 4:2</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 8:22'>Zec 8:22</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:16'>14:16</a> ). The only such purging and restoration in Scripture is that spoken of in conjunction with the yet-future “time of Jacob’s distress” ( <a ref='Jeremiah 30:6–7'>Jer 30:6–7</a> ; i.e., Daniel’s 70th week, cf. <a ref='Daniel 9:24–27'>Da 9:24–27</a> ) and the second advent of the Messiah ( <a ref='Zechariah 14:4'>Zec 14:4</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 1:27'>1:27</a> <b>Zion.</b> Originally a designation for the hill Ophel, this name became a synonym for the entire city of Jerusalem. Isaiah always uses it that way. <b>be redeemed … repentant ones.</b> That remnant of the city who repented of their sins would find redemption in conjunction with God’s future restoration of Israel’s prosperity (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 59:20'>59:20</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 1:28'>1:28</a> <b>transgressors … sinners … those who forsake.</b> Concurrent with the future blessing of the faithful remnant, Yahweh will relegate the unrepentant to destruction. This is the only way Zion can become pure. <a ref='Isaiah 1:29'>1:29</a> <b>oaks … gardens.</b> These were settings where Israel practiced idolatrous worship. It is ironic that Yahweh had chosen Israel while some citizens of Jerusalem have chosen the “gardens.” When God calls them to account for their rebellious choice, they will be ashamed and embarrassed. <a ref='Isaiah 1:31'>1:31</a> <b>burn together … none to quench.</b> Both the rebel and his works will perish. This is final judgment, not merely another captivity. <a ref='Isaiah 2:1–5:30'>2:1—5:30</a> Chapters <a ref='Is 2-5'>2–5</a> comprise a single connected discourse. <a ref='Isaiah 2:1–5'>2:1–5</a> The first of 3 pictures of Zion (Jerusalem) in this discourse that depicts her future exaltation. <a ref='Isaiah 2:2–4'>2:2–4</a> The book of Micah contains this portion of Isaiah’s prophecy almost word for word ( <a ref='Micah 4:1–3'>Mic 4:1–3</a> ), indicating that the younger contemporary of Isaiah may have obtained the words from him. Both passages present a prophetic picture of Zion in the future messianic kingdom when all people will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of the world. <a ref='Isaiah 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>In the last days.</b> The “last days” is a time designation looking forward to the messianic era ( <a ref='Ezekiel 38:16'>Eze 38:16</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 3:5'>Hos 3:5</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:1'>Mic 4:1</a> ). The NT applied the expression to the period beginning with the first advent of Jesus Christ ( <a ref='Acts 2:17'>Ac 2:17</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 3:1'>2Ti 3:1</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 1:2'>Heb 1:2</a> ; <a ref='James 5:3'>Jas 5:3</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 3:3'>2Pe 3:3</a> ). Old Testament prophets, being without a clear word regarding the time between the Messiah’s two advents, linked the expression to the Messiah’s return to establish His earthly kingdom, i.e., the millennial kingdom spoken about in <a ref='Revelation 20:1–10'>Rev 20:1–10</a> . <b>The mountain of the house of Yahweh.</b> The reference is to Mt. Zion, the location of the temple in Jerusalem. The expression occurs two other times in the OT ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 33:15'>2Chr 33:15</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:1'>Mic 4:1</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 2:3'>2:3</a> <b>mountain of Yahweh.</b> Isaiah frequently calls Mt.

Warfare will continue to characterize human history until the Prince of Peace ( <a ref='Isaiah 9:6'>9:6</a> ) returns to earth to put an end to it. <a ref='Isaiah 2:6–4:1'>2:6—4:1</a> After a glimpse of Judah’s glorious future ( <a ref='Isaiah 2:1–5'>2:1–5</a> ), the prophet returned to the present for a scathing rebuke of her idolatry and the judgment of God it evokes. <a ref='Isaiah 2:6–9'>2:6–9</a> Isaiah stated Yahweh’s formal charge against the people of Jerusalem. <a ref='Isaiah 2:6'>2:6</a> influences <b>from the east.</b> Through caravans from the east, an influx of religious superstitions had filled Jerusalem and its environs. <a ref='Isaiah 2:8'>2:8</a> <b>filled with idols.</b> Jotham and Ahaz, two of the kings under whom Isaiah prophesied, failed to remove the idolatrous high places from the land ( <a ref='2 Kings 15:35'>2Ki 15:35</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 16:4'>16:4</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 2:10–22'>2:10–22</a> This section pictures conditions during the future day of Yahweh. Though some elements of the description could fit what Judah experienced in the Babylonian captivity, the intensity of judgment predicted here could not have found fulfillment at that time. The tribulation period before Christ’s return will be the time for these judgmental horrors. <a ref='Isaiah 2:12'>2:12</a> <b>Yahweh of hosts will have a day</b> of reckoning <b>.</b> The phrase “day of reckoning” or “day of Yahweh” appears 19 times in the OT ( <a ref='Obadiah 1:15'>Ob 15</a> ; <a ref='Joel 1:15'>Joel 1:15</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:1'>2:1</a> , <a ref='Joel 2:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Joel 2:31'>31</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:14'>3:14</a> ; <a ref='Amos 5:18'>Am 5:18</a> , <a ref='Amos 5:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 2:12'>Is 2:12</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 13:6'>13:6</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 13:9'>9</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 1:7'>Zep 1:7</a> , <a ref='Zephaniah 1:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 13:5'>Eze 13:5</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 30:3'>30:3</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:1'>Zec 14:1</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 4:5'>Mal 4:5</a> ) and 4 times in the NT ( <a ref='Acts 2:20'>Ac 2:20</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:2'>1Th 5:2</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:2'>2Th 2:2</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 3:10'>2Pe 3:10</a> ) to express the time of God’s extreme wrath. The day of reckoning can refer to a near future judgment ( <a ref='Ezekiel 13:5'>Eze 13:5</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 30:3'>30:3</a> ) or a far future judgment ( <a ref='Zechariah 14:1'>Zec 14:1</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:2'>2Th 2:2</a> ). Two “day of Yahweh” expressions remain to be fulfilled: 1) at the end of Daniel’s 70th week (see <a ref='Joel 3:14'>Joel 3:14</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 4:5'>Mal 4:5</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:2'>1Th 5:2</a> ) and 2) at the end of the Millennium (see <a ref='2 Peter 3:10'>2Pe 3:10</a> ). The day of reckoning can occur through providential means ( <a ref='Ezekiel 30:3'>Eze 30:3</a> ) or directly at the hand of God ( <a ref='2 Peter 3:10'>2Pe 3:10</a> ). At times, the near fulfillment ( <a ref='Joel 1:15'>Joel 1:15</a> ) prefigures the far fulfillment ( <a ref='Joel 3:14'>Joel 3:14</a> ); on other occasions, both kinds of fulfillment are included in one passage ( <a ref='Isaiah 13:6'>13:6</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 13:9'>9</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 1:7'>Zep 1:7</a> , <a ref='Zephaniah 1:14'>14</a> ). Here Isaiah looks to the far fulfillment at the end of the time of Jacob’s trouble ( <a ref='Jeremiah 30:7'>Jer 30:7</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 2:13'>2:13</a> <b>cedars of Lebanon … oaks of Bashan.</b> The cedars and oaks were objects of great admiration to people of OT times ( <a ref='Psalms 92:12'>Pss 92:12</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 104:16'>104:16</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 27:6'>Eze 27:6</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 31:3'>31:3</a> ). Yet even these impressive created objects would face destruction because of human rebellion. <a ref='Isaiah 2:19'>2:19</a> <b>caves of the rocks … holes of the ground.</b> <a ref='Revelation 6:12'>Revelation 6:12</a> , <a ref='Revelation 6:15–16'>15–16</a> uses this passage and <a ref='Isaiah 2:21'>2:21</a> to describe man’s flight from the terrors of tribulation during the period before Christ’s personal return to earth. This shows that the final fulfillment of this prophecy will be during Daniel’s 70th week. <a ref='Isaiah 2:22'>2:22</a> <b>Stop regarding man.</b> This calls readers to stop depending on other humans and to trust only in God, who alone is worthy. <a ref='Isaiah 3:1–4:1'>3:1—4:1</a> Yahweh’s indictment against and judgment of Jerusalem and Judah continued. <a ref='Isaiah 3:1'>3:1</a> <b>the Lord, Yahweh of hosts.</b> Emphasizing His ultimate authority, God refers to Himself by the title Adonai (“Yahweh”), the sovereign Lord of all, and by the mighty and warlike “Yahweh of hosts.” <a ref='Isaiah 3:1–3'>3:1–3</a> <b>remove … diviner.</b> God’s judgment was to include a removal of the people’s leadership. <a ref='Isaiah 3:4–5'>3:4–5</a> <b>children … honorable.</b> Inexperience in government was to lead to degeneration and irresponsibility at every level of national life. <a ref='Isaiah 3:6–7'>3:6–7</a> <b>these ruins … ruler of the people.</b> Conditions of anarchy were to be so bad that no one would accept a position of authority over the people. <a ref='Isaiah 3:8'>3:8</a> <b>Jerusalem … Judah.</b> The fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC was only a partial fulfillment of this prophecy. The final fulfillment awaits the times just prior to Christ’s second coming. <b>against Yahweh.</b> The root of Zion’s problem surfaces: overt rebellion against Yahweh. The people sinned shamelessly; they made no effort to conceal it ( <a ref='Isaiah 3:9'>3:9</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 3:12'>3:12</a> <b>infants … women.</b> Infants and women were considered ill-suited for governmental leadership, so they figuratively depicted the incompetent rulers. <a ref='Isaiah 3:14'>3:14</a> <b>vineyard.</b> The spoiling of the vineyard by the leaders amounts to their inequities in ruling the nation. Isaiah gave a more detailed comparison of God’s people to a vineyard in <a ref='Isaiah 5:1–7'>5:1–7</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 3:16'>3:16</a> <b>daughters of Zion.</b> When women cultivate beauty for beauty’s sake, they thereby reflect the moral decay of the nations and detract from the glory of God. Rather than emphasizing outward apparel and activities (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 3:16–24'>16–24</a> ), ladies should cultivate the beauty of the inner person ( <a ref='1 Timothy 2:9–10'>1Ti 2:9–10</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 3:3–4'>1Pe 3:3–4</a> ). <b>mincing steps.</b> Ornamental chains about the ankles necessitated shorter steps and produced tinkling sounds to attract attention. <a ref='Isaiah 4:1'>4:1</a> <b>seven women … one man.</b> In the day of reckoning, or the day of Yahweh ( <i>see note on <a ref='Isaiah 2:12'>2:12</a></i> ), He will judge wicked women indirectly by allowing a slaughtering of males, thereby producing a shortage of husbands. <a ref='Isaiah 4:2–6'>4:2–6</a> The third picture of Zion resembles the first ( <a ref='Isaiah 2:1–5'>2:1–5</a> ): an eventual purification and prosperity in the Land. <a ref='Isaiah 4:2'>4:2</a> <b>Branch.</b> This messianic title occurs also in <a ref='Jeremiah 23:5'>Jer 23:5</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 33:15'>33:15</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 3:8'>Zec 3:8</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 6:12'>6:12</a> . The thought behind the title relates to <a ref='2 Samuel 23:5'>2Sa 23:5</a> , that of growth. The life of the Branch will bear spiritual fruit (cf. <a ref='John 15:4–5'>Jn 15:4–5</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 4:3'>4:3</a> <b>he who remains … holy.</b> “Holy” or “set apart” is another way of describing the remnant who will inherit God’s prosperity in that day (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 1:9'>1:9</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 1:27'>27</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 3:10'>3:10</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 4:4'>4:4</a> <b>spirit of burning.</b> For other instances of purging by burning, see <a ref='Isaiah 1:25'>1:25</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 6:6–7'>6:6–7</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 4:5–6'>4:5–6</a> <b>canopy … booth.</b> The future inhabitants of Jerusalem will enjoy Yahweh’s protective covering over the glory on Mt. Zion. This recalls Ezekiel’s prophecy of the return of the Shekinah to the temple ( <a ref='Ezekiel 43:2–5'>Eze 43:2–5</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 5:1–30'>5:1–30</a> The conclusion of the extended discourse begun at <a ref='Isaiah 2:1'>2:1</a> comes by way of a comparison of God’s people to a vineyard which He cultivated, but which did not bear fruit. <a ref='Isaiah 5:1'>5:1</a> <b>well-beloved.</b> Yahweh is the friend who is well-beloved by Isaiah. The vineyard belongs to Him ( <a ref='Isaiah 5:7'>5:7</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 5:2'>5:2</a> good <b>grapes … worthless ones.</b> The owner made every conceivable provision for the vine’s productivity and protection, illustrating Yahweh’s purely gracious choice of Israel. Justifiably, He expected a good yield from His investment, but the vine’s produce was “sour berries,” inedible and fit only for dumping. <a ref='Isaiah 5:5'>5:5</a> <b>consumed … trampled ground.</b> As punishment for her unfruitfulness, Israel became desolate and accessible to any nation wishing to invade her, such as happened in the Babylonian invasion of 586 BC, and will happen repeatedly until her national repentance at the second coming of the Messiah. <a ref='Isaiah 5:7'>5:7</a> <b>justice … bloodshed … righteousness … cry.</b> The English words “equity … iniquity … right … riot” illustrate the effective play on words in the underlying Hebrew behind v. <a ref='Isaiah 5:7'>7</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 5:8–23'>5:8–23</a> The prophet pronounced 6 woes (judgments) against the unresponsive people of Israel. <a ref='Isaiah 5:8–10'>5:8–10</a> The first woe was against real estate owners because of their greedy materialism. <a ref='Isaiah 5:8'>5:8</a> <b>house to house … field to field.</b> God gave the land to the Israelites with the intention that the original allocation remain with each family ( <a ref='Leviticus 25:23–25'>Lv 25:23–25</a> ). By Isaiah’s time, land speculators had begun putting together huge estates ( <a ref='Micah 2:2'>Mic 2:2</a> , <a ref='Micah 2:9'>9</a> ), and the powerful rich used legal processes to deprive the poor of what was rightfully theirs ( <a ref='Amos 2:6–7'>Am 2:6–7</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 5:10'>5:10</a> <b>one bath … an ephah.</b> God judged the greedy rich by reducing the productivity of their land to a small fraction of what it would have been normally. One bath was roughly equivalent to six gallons (contra. marginal note). About one-half bushel would be produced from about six bushels of planted seed. Such amounts indicate famine conditions. <a ref='Isaiah 5:11–12'>5:11–12</a> The second woe addressed the drunkards for their neglect of Yahweh’s work of judgment and redemption, and their devotion to pleasure. <a ref='Isaiah 5:14'>5:14</a> <b>Sheol.</b> This term in this context pictures death as a great monster with wide-open jaws, ready to receive its victims. Such was to be the fate of those who perish in the captivity God will send to punish the people’s sinfulness. <a ref='Isaiah 5:18–19'>5:18–19</a> The third woe was against those who defied Yahweh and ridiculed His prophet. <a ref='Isaiah 5:19'>5:19</a> <b>Let Him hurry.</b> The taunting unbelievers said, “Where is the judgment of which you have spoken, Isaiah? Bring it on. We will believe it when we see it.” This challenge for God to hasten His judgment represented their disbelief that the Holy One of Israel would judge the people. See Isaiah’s response in the naming of his son: “Concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz” ( <a ref='Isaiah 8:1'>8:1</a> ; cf. <a ref='Isaiah 5:26'>5:26</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 5:20'>5:20</a> <b>evil good and good evil.</b> The fourth woe condemned the reversal of morality which dominated the nation. They utterly confused all moral distinctions. <a ref='Isaiah 5:21'>5:21</a> <b>wise in their own eyes.</b> The object of the fifth woe was the people’s arrogance. “Pride <i>goes</i> before destruction. …” ( <a ref='Proverbs 16:18'>Pr 16:18</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 5:22–23'>5:22–23</a> <b>declare the wicked righteous.</b> The sixth woe pointed to the unjust sentences passed by drunken and bribed judges. <a ref='Isaiah 5:24–30'>5:24–30</a> The conclusion of the discourse announced God’s action in sending a mighty army against Judah to conquer and leave the land in darkness and distress. <a ref='Isaiah 5:26'>5:26</a> <b>distant nations.</b> Principal among the nations God would bring against Israel were: 1) Assyria, which conquered the northern kingdom in 722 BC, and 2) Babylon, which completed its invasion of Jerusalem in 586 BC and destroyed the temple. <a ref='Isaiah 5:30'>5:30</a> <b>darkness.</b> God’s wrath against the people was to eliminate light ( <a ref='Isaiah 8:22'>8:22</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 42:7'>42:7</a> ), but His promised deliverance of the remnant will ultimately turn that darkness into light at the coming of the Messiah ( <a ref='Isaiah 9:2'>9:2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 42:16'>42:16</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 58:10'>58:10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:2'>60:2</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 6:1–5'>6:1–5</a> In preparation for calling Isaiah to be the prophet who would proclaim the coming judgment, God gave him a vision of His majestic holiness so overwhelming that it devastated him and made him realize his own sinfulness. <a ref='Isaiah 6:1'>6:1</a> <b>King Uzziah’s death.</b> After 52 years of reigning, leprosy caused the death of Uzziah in 739 BC (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 26:16–23'>2Chr 26:16–23</a> ). Isaiah began his prophetic ministry that year. He received the prophecies of the first 5 chapters after his call, but at <a ref='Isaiah 6:1'>6:1</a> he returns to authenticate what he has already written by describing how he was called. <b>I saw.</b> The prophet became unconscious of the outside world and with his inner eye saw what God revealed to him. This experience recalls the experience of John’s prophetic vision in <a ref='Revelation 4:1–11'>Rev 4:1–11</a> . <b>high and lifted up.</b> The throne was greatly elevated, emphasizing the Most High God. <b>train.</b> This refers to the hem or fringe of Yahweh’s glorious robe that filled the temple. <b>temple.</b> Though Isaiah may have been at the earthly temple, this describes a vision which transcends the earthly.

The prophet looked at the final Babylon at the end of the tribulation. The language is that which characterizes conditions during the millennial kingdom after the judgment of the final Babylon. The destruction of future Babylon is integrally connected with the deliverance of Israel from bondage. Babylon must perish so that Yahweh may exalt His people.

Just as Yahweh addressed Satan in His words to the serpent ( <a ref='Genesis 3:14–15'>Ge 3:14–15</a> ), this inspired dirge speaks to the king of Babylon and to the devil who energized him. See <a ref='Ezekiel 28:12–17'>Eze 28:12–17</a> for similar language to the king of Tyre and Satan behind him. <a ref='Isaiah 14:12'>14:12</a> <b>heaven.</b> The scene suddenly shifts from the underworld to heaven to emphasize the unbridled pride of the king and Satan energizing him. <b>star of the morning.</b> Tradition of the time saw the stars as representing gods battling among themselves for places of preeminence. <a ref='Isaiah 14:13–14'>14:13–14</a> <b>I will.</b> Five “I wills” emphasize the arrogance of the king of Babylon, and of Satan, from whom he takes his cue. <a ref='Isaiah 14:13'>14:13</a> <b>mount of assembly.</b> This was a mountain in northern Syria, according to local tradition, where the Canaanite gods assembled.

But since <a ref='2 Kings 18:1'>2Ki 18:1</a> says he began to reign in the third year of Hoshea, ca. 729 BC, Hezekiah served as co-regent with Ahaz (ca. 729–716 BC) before assuming the throne exclusively. It was customary for the later kings of Israel to assume their sons into partnership in the government during their lives. <b>Sennacherib.</b> The king of Assyria (ca. 705 to 681 BC). <b>fortified cities.</b> The discovery of the ancient <i>Annals of Sennacherib</i> reveals the cities he conquered in his campaign southward from Sidon on the Mediterranean coast. <a ref='Isaiah 36:2'>36:2</a> <b>Rabshakeh.</b> The spokesman for Sennacherib’s 3 highest officials, who represented the king against Jerusalem on this occasion, according to <a ref='2 Kings 18:17'>2Ki 18:17</a> . <b>heavy military force.</b> This was a token force of the main army ( <a ref='Isaiah 37:36'>37:36</a> ), with which Sennacherib hoped to bluff Judah into submitting. <b>Lachish.</b> A city about 25 mi. southwest of Jerusalem. Sennacherib’s conquest of this city was in its closing phase when he sent the messengers. <b>conduit of the upper pool.</b> Isaiah met Ahaz at the same spot to try unsuccessfully to dissuade him from trusting in foreign powers ( <a ref='Isaiah 7:3'>7:3</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 36:3'>36:3</a> <b>Eliakim … Shebna.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Isaiah 22:19–22'>22:19–22</a> .</i> <b>Joah … the recorder.</b> The position was that of an intermediary between the king and the people. <a ref='Isaiah 36:4–10'>36:4–10</a> Rabshakeh’s logic was twofold: 1) Egypt was to be unable to deliver Jerusalem (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 36:4–6'>4–6</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 36:8–9'>8–9</a> ), and 2) Yahweh had called on the Assyrians to destroy Judah (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 36:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 36:10'>10</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 36:4'>36:4</a> <b>the great king, the king of Assyria.</b> The self-appropriated title of Assyrian kings. In contrast, Rabshakeh rudely omitted any title for Hezekiah (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 36:4'>4</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 36:14–16'>14–16</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 36:5'>36:5</a> <b>empty words.</b> Words amounted to nothing when it came to warfare. In other words, Judah was defenseless. <a ref='Isaiah 36:6'>36:6</a> <b>crushed reed … Egypt.</b> The Assyrian’s advice strongly resembled that of Isaiah ( <a ref='Isaiah 19:14–16'>19:14–16</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 30:7'>30:7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 31:3'>31:3</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 36:7'>36:7</a> <b>He whose high places and whose altars.</b> Rabshakeh mistakenly thought Hezekiah’s reforms in removing idols ( <a ref='2 Kings 18:4'>2Ki 18:4</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 31:1'>2Chr 31:1</a> ) had removed opportunities to worship Yahweh. <b>this altar.</b> That all worship should center in Solomon’s temple was utterly foreign to the polytheistic Assyrians. <a ref='Isaiah 36:8–9'>36:8–9</a> Rabshakeh taunted and minimized Judah’s best defensive efforts, even with Egypt’s help. <a ref='Isaiah 36:10'>36:10</a> <b>Yahweh said.</b> Rabshakeh’s boastful claim of the authority from Judah’s God for his mission may have been a ploy on his part to get a surrender, but it aligned with Isaiah’s prophecy that the Assyrians would be His instrument to punish His people ( <a ref='Isaiah 8:7–8'>8:7–8</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 10:5–6'>10:5–6</a> ). The Assyrians may have heard this from partisans or may not have known this, but Judah did. <a ref='Isaiah 36:11'>36:11</a> <b>Aramaic … Judean.</b> Hezekiah’s representatives, aware of the alarm created by the suggestion that Yahweh was on the Assyrian side, asked Rabshakeh to change from Hebrew, or Judean, to Aramaic, the language of diplomacy, so the people on the wall could not understand his words and be terrified. <a ref='Isaiah 36:12'>36:12</a> <b>men … on the wall.</b> The foreign emissary continued his efforts to damage the city’s morale by speaking of the horrors of famine that a long siege would entail. <a ref='Isaiah 36:13–17'>36:13–17</a> Rabshakeh spoke longer and louder, suggesting that Hezekiah could not save the city, but the great king, the king of Assyria, would fill the people with abundance (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 36:16–17'>16–17</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 36:16'>36:16</a> <b>Make your peace.</b> Lit. “Make a blessing with me.” The official invited the people to make a covenant with Assyria by surrendering. <a ref='Isaiah 36:17'>36:17</a> <b>take you away.</b> Rabshakeh did not hide Assyria’s well-known practice of deporting conquered peoples to distant places. <a ref='Isaiah 36:18–20'>36:18–20</a> In Rabshakeh’s eyes, Yahweh was one of the many gods worshiped by nations conquered by the Assyrians (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 10:8–11'>10:8–11</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 36:21'>36:21</a> <b>were silent.</b> Hezekiah had apparently anticipated the ultimatum of the Assyrians and had told his representatives and the men on the wall not to respond. <a ref='Isaiah 36:22'>36:22</a> <b>clothes torn.</b> The king’s representatives reported to him in a state of grief and shock at the blasphemy they thought they had heard. <a ref='Isaiah 37:1'>37:1</a> <b>tore … sackcloth.</b> A reaction that symbolized Hezekiah’s grief, repentance and contrition. The nation was to repent and the king was to lead the way. <b>house of Yahweh.</b> God designated the temple as His “house of prayer” ( <a ref='Isaiah 56:7'>56:7</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 21:13'>Mt 21:13</a> ; <a ref='Mark 11:17'>Mk 11:17</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:46'>Lk 19:46</a> ), so it was the proper place to go to confess sins and seek forgiveness (cf. <a ref='Psalms 73:16–17'>Ps 73:16–17</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 37:2'>37:2</a> <b>elders of the priests.</b> Senior religious leaders in Israel. <a ref='Isaiah 37:3'>37:3</a> <b>come to the point of breaking forth … no strength.</b> Hezekiah compared his dilemma with a mother in labor unable to deliver her child.

Hezekiah asked Isaiah’s prayer for the city. <a ref='Isaiah 37:6'>37:6</a> <b>Do not be afraid.</b> The same assurance Isaiah had given Ahaz ( <a ref='Isaiah 7:4'>7:4</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 37:7'>37:7</a> <b>spirit.</b> Yahweh promised to incline Sennacherib’s attitude in such a way that he would leave Jerusalem unharmed and return home. <a ref='Isaiah 37:8'>37:8</a> <b>Libnah.</b> After conquering Lachish, Sennacherib moved on to this smaller town to the north of Lachish. <a ref='Isaiah 37:9'>37:9</a> <b>Tirhakah king of Ethiopia.</b> Tirhakah did not become king of Ethiopia, or Cush (and Egypt), until 11 years after the 701 BC siege, so Isaiah’s use of “king” anticipates his future title. At that moment, however, he represented a threat to Sennacherib from the south that caused him to renew his call for Jerusalem’s surrender to the north. <a ref='Isaiah 37:10–13'>37:10–13</a> The king of Assyria sent messengers to summarize the arguments given in Rabshakeh’s ultimatum of <a ref='Isaiah 36:4–19'>36:4–19</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 37:10'>37:10</a> <b>deceive.</b> The accusation of deception was first against Hezekiah ( <a ref='Isaiah 36:14'>36:14</a> ), then against Yahweh. <a ref='Isaiah 37:11–13'>37:11–13</a> The threat repeats the thrust of <a ref='Isaiah 36:18–20'>36:18–20</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 37:12'>37:12</a> The conquered cities mentioned here lay between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in Mesopotamia. <a ref='Isaiah 37:13'>37:13</a> These were cities of Syria that had fallen to the Assyrians recently. <a ref='Isaiah 37:14'>37:14</a> <b>house of Yahweh.</b> Godly Hezekiah returned to the house of Yahweh (cf. v. <a ref='Isaiah 37:1'>1</a> ) as he should have, in contrast to Ahaz, who in a similar crisis refused even to ask a sign from Yahweh ( <a ref='Isaiah 7:11–12'>7:11–12</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 37:16'>37:16</a> <b>who is enthroned … made heaven and earth.</b> The basis for Hezekiah’s plea was God’s role as the Sovereign and Creator of the universe, not Judah’s worthiness to be delivered. <a ref='Isaiah 37:17'>37:17</a> <b>hear … see … listen.</b> In contrast to the gods of other nations ( <a ref='Psalms 115:4–7'>Ps 115:4–7</a> ), the God of Israel heard and saw all. <a ref='Isaiah 37:18–19'>37:18–19</a> Hezekiah exploded the Assyrian theory that Yahweh was no different from gods of the other nations that could not deliver their worshipers. <a ref='Isaiah 37:20'>37:20</a> <b>You alone.</b> Hezekiah displayed the highest motivation of all in requesting the salvation of Jerusalem: that the world may know that Yahweh alone is God (cf. <a ref='Daniel 9:16–19'>Da 9:16–19</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 37:21'>37:21</a> <b>Isaiah the son of Amoz.</b> Immediately upon the conclusion of Hezekiah’s prayer, Isaiah had a response from Yahweh. <a ref='Isaiah 37:22'>37:22</a> <b>mocked you.</b> Jerusalem, portrayed as a virgin helpless before a would-be rapist, had the “last laugh” against Sennacherib. <a ref='Isaiah 37:23'>37:23</a> <b>you reproached and blasphemed.</b> Yahweh had heard Sennacherib’s reproach against Him ( <a ref='Isaiah 37:17'>37:17</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 37:24–25'>37:24–25</a> Even the servants of Sennacherib had bragged about Assyria’s being unstoppable. <a ref='Isaiah 37:26'>37:26</a> <b>I have brought it to pass.</b> God corrected Sennacherib’s vanity; he conquered nothing on his own, but was a mere instrument in Yahweh’s hand. <a ref='Isaiah 37:27'>37:27</a> <b>They were dismayed.</b> Assyria had utterly overwhelmed populations included in their conquests. <a ref='Isaiah 37:28'>37:28</a> <b>your raging against Me.</b> Sennacherib’s ignorance of being a mere tool in Yahweh’s hand was bad, but his belittling of God, the source of his life, was far worse. <a ref='Isaiah 37:29'>37:29</a> <b>hook in your nose … bridle in your lips.</b> In judging Sennacherib, Yahweh treated him as an obstinate animal with a ring in his nose and/or a bridle in his mouth. Some ancient sources indicate that captives were led before a king by a cord attached to a hook or ring through the upper lip and nose. Thus, he was to be brought back to his own country. <a ref='Isaiah 37:30'>37:30</a> <b>sign.</b> The two years in which they were sustained by the growth of the crops were the two in which Sennacherib ravaged them (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 32:10'>32:10</a> ).

The words “There is no peace for the wicked” ( <a ref='Isaiah 48:22'>48:22</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 57:21'>57:21</a> ) signal the divisions of this section into three parts: chaps. <a ref='Is 40-48'>40–48</a> , chaps. <a ref='Is 49-57'>49–57</a> , and chaps. <a ref='Is 58-66'>58–66</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 40:1–48:22'>40:1—48:22</a> This section looks at the hope and comfort of a blessed future subsequent to God’s judgment in the forthcoming Babylonian captivity. <a ref='Isaiah 40:1–2'>40:1–2</a> <b>Comfort … comfort.</b> The prophecy addressed God’s prophets, instructing them to emphasize the theme of comfort to a captive people in a foreign land many mi. from their home city of Jerusalem. God has good plans for great blessing to Israel in the future because they are His covenant people, who are never to be permanently cast away (cf. <a ref='Romans 11:2'>Ro 11:2</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 40:2'>40:2</a> <b>iniquity has been removed … Double for all her sins.</b> Cruel slaughter and captivity at the hands of the Babylonians were sufficient payment for past sins; so someday after worldwide dispersion, Israel will return to her land in peace and in the glory of Messiah’s kingdom. <a ref='Isaiah 40:3–5'>40:3–5</a> A prophetic exhortation told Israel to prepare for the revelation of Yahweh’s glory at the arrival of Messiah. Scripture sees John the Baptist in this role ( <a ref='Matthew 3:3'>Mt 3:3</a> ; <a ref='Mark 1:3'>Mk 1:3</a> ; <a ref='Luke 3:4–6'>Lk 3:4–6</a> ; <a ref='John 1:23'>Jn 1:23</a> ). It likewise sees the future forerunner who is to be like Elijah preparing for Christ’s second coming ( <a ref='Malachi 3:1'>Mal 3:1</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 4:5–6'>4:5–6</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 40:3–4'>40:3–4</a> <b>Prepare the way.</b> The remnant of Israel could remove obstacles from the coming Messiah’s path through repentance from their sins. John the Baptist reminded his listeners of this necessity ( <a ref='Matthew 3:2'>Mt 3:2</a> ), as did Jesus ( <a ref='Matthew 4:17'>Mt 4:17</a> ; <a ref='Mark 1:15'>Mk 1:15</a> ). These verses reflect the custom of some eastern monarchs to send heralds before them to clear away obstacles, make causeways, straighten crooked roads and valleys, and level hills (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 45:1–2'>45:1–2</a> ). John had the task of getting people ready for Messiah’s arrival. <a ref='Isaiah 40:5'>40:5</a> <b>glory of Yahweh … revealed.</b> Jerusalem’s misery is to end and Yahweh’s glory to replace it, so comfort will come to the city (v. <a ref='Isaiah 40:2'>2</a> ), and every person will see God’s glorious salvation (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 52:10'>52:10</a> ) in Messiah’s future kingdom ( <a ref='Habakkuk 2:14'>Hab 2:14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 21:23'>Rev 21:23</a> ; cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:9'>11:9</a> ). <b>mouth of Yahweh has spoken.</b> Used for confirmations also in <a ref='Isaiah 1:20'>1:20</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 58:14'>58:14</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 62:2'>62:2</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 40:6–8'>40:6–8</a> <b>All flesh … flower fades.</b> Isaiah elaborated on how transitory humanity is: here today, gone tomorrow. People pass away like plants under the hot breath of the withering east wind. James used this illustration to teach the folly of trusting in material wealth ( <a ref='James 1:10–11'>Jas 1:10–11</a> ). Peter used it to illustrate the passing nature of everything related to humanity ( <a ref='1 Peter 1:24–25'>1Pe 1:24–25</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 40:8'>40:8</a> <b>the word of our God stands forever.</b> The permanence of God’s word guarantees against any deviation from the divine plan ( <a ref='Isaiah 55:11'>55:11</a> ). He has promised Jerusalem’s deliverance (v. <a ref='Isaiah 40:2'>2</a> ) through His coming (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 40:3–5'>3–5</a> ), so it must happen that way (cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:18'>Mt 5:18</a> ; <a ref='Luke 16:17'>Lk 16:17</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 40:9'>40:9</a> <b>Zion … good news … Jerusalem … good news.</b> Like a messenger on a mountain, to be seen and heard by all, the prophet called on the city to proclaim loudly to the rest of Judah’s cities the good news of God’s presence there (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 2:3'>2:3</a> ). <b>Behold your God!</b> The restoration of Israel to the land is to include the resumption of God’s presence in Jerusalem after many centuries ( <a ref='Ezekiel 43:1–7'>Eze 43:1–7</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 21:22–23'>Rev 21:22–23</a> ; cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 11:22–23'>Eze 11:22–23</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 40:10'>40:10</a> <b>Lord Yahweh will come with strength.</b> At His second coming, Christ returns with power to defeat His enemies and gather the dispersed of Israel to their land ( <a ref='Matthew 24:31'>Mt 24:31</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:11–21'>Rev 19:11–21</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 40:11'>40:11</a> <b>His arm.</b> A picture of God’s omnipotence. The same arm that powerfully scatters the Jews all over the earth in judgment is to overcome Israel’s oppressors (v. <a ref='Isaiah 40:10'>10</a> ) and to tenderly feed and lead His flock ( <a ref='Psalms 23:1–2'>Ps 23:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 31:10'>Jer 31:10</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 34:11–16'>Eze 34:11–16</a> ; <a ref='Micah 2:12'>Mic 2:12</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 40:12–14'>40:12–14</a> By a series of questions, to which the implied answer is “no one,” the prophet emphasized the omnipotence and omniscience of God, the God whose coming is to bring comfort to Israel according to vv. <a ref='Isaiah 40:1–11'>1–11</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 40:12'>40:12</a> <b>Who has measured … in a balance…?</b> God alone has power to create the physical universe and the earth in perfect balance, weighing mountains and seas perfectly, so that the earth moves perfectly in space. This matter of the amazing balance of our planet is called the science of isostasy. <a ref='Isaiah 40:13–14'>40:13–14</a> <b>encompassed the Spirit of Yahweh.</b> Isaiah pointed to the incomparable wisdom of God. Paul alluded to this verse in connection with God’s wisdom in dealing with Jews and Gentiles ( <a ref='Romans 11:34'>Ro 11:34</a> ) and with God’s impartation of wisdom to the spiritual believer ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:16'>1Co 2:16</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 40:15–17'>40:15–17</a> Since the surrounding nations who had oppressed Israel were utterly insignificant in comparison to Yahweh’s greatness and power, they could not prevent His purposes from being accomplished. His deliverance of Israel was certain. <a ref='Isaiah 40:16'>40:16</a> <b>burn … burnt offering.</b> God is so great and worthy of so much worship that even the large wood and animal resources of Lebanon were insufficient for appropriate offerings to Him. <a ref='Isaiah 40:18–20'>40:18–20</a> The prophet sarcastically indicated the futility of trying to portray the immensity of God—His power, wisdom, and resources—in the form of a man-made idol, no matter how ornate, durable, and immovable. <a ref='Isaiah 40:21–31'>40:21–31</a> Isaiah extolled God as Creator, in whom the Jews were to put their full trust. <a ref='Isaiah 40:21'>40:21</a> <b>declared to you … understood.</b> Throughout human history people had heard by special revelation from God that Yahweh, not idols, created all things. They had also understood it from natural revelation as reason looks at creation (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:20'>Ro 1:20</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 40:22'>40:22</a> <b>inhabits above the circle of the earth.</b> The word “circle” is applicable to the spherical form of the earth, above which He sits. This implies that God upholds and maintains His creation on a continuing basis ( <a ref='Colossians 1:17'>Col 1:17</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 1:3'>Heb 1:3</a> ). As He looks down, men seem like insects to the One who has stretched and spread out the universal heavens. <a ref='Isaiah 40:23'>40:23</a> <b>rulers … judges.</b> God disposes of human leaders according to His will ( <a ref='Isaiah 34:12'>34:12</a> ; <a ref='Job 12:17–21'>Job 12:17–21</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 107:40'>Ps 107:40</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 2:21'>Da 2:21</a> ). Verse <a ref='Isaiah 40:24'>24</a> expands on how suddenly God removes them. <a ref='Isaiah 40:25'>40:25</a> <b>liken … be</b> his <b>equal.</b> Israel was foolish to compare such a sovereign, almighty Lord with the gods of their Babylonian captors (see v. <a ref='Isaiah 40:18'>18</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 40:26'>40:26</a> <b>created these</b> stars. Rather than worshiping the stars ( <a ref='Isaiah 47:13'>47:13</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:19'>Dt 4:19</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 7:18'>Jer 7:18</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 8:2'>8:2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 44:17'>44:17</a> ), Israel should have seen in them the evidence of God’s creatorship ( <a ref='Psalms 19:1'>Ps 19:1</a> ). As innumerable as the stars are, He knows every one and named each. Not one of the stars runs astray, but all are held by the forces with which He has endowed the universe to keep them in their orbit and place. <a ref='Isaiah 40:27–31'>40:27–31</a> The prophet applied the comforting truths in vv. <a ref='Isaiah 40:1–26'>1–26</a> about God to Israel’s situation in Babylon during the coming captivity. <a ref='Isaiah 40:27'>40:27</a> <b>Why do you say…?</b> In light of who God is, how could His people in exile have thought He had forgotten them or was ignorant of their condition? <a ref='Isaiah 40:28'>40:28</a> <b>Does not become weary or tired.</b> God was not too weak to act on their behalf, nor was fatigue an obstacle for the Creator in caring for His people (cf. vv. <a ref='Isaiah 40:29–30'>29–30</a> ). Though even the young and strong become tired and fall, the Ancient of Days never does. <b>unsearchable.</b> To the human mind, God’s wisdom is not fully comprehensible in how He chooses to fulfill His promises to deliver Israel. Paul saw a further illustration of this truth in God’s plan for the final restoration of Israel ( <a ref='Romans 11:33'>Ro 11:33</a> ; see <a ref='Isaiah 40:13'>Is 40:13</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 40:31'>40:31</a> <b>hope in Yahweh.</b> See <a ref='Isaiah 8:17'>8:17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 49:23'>49:23</a> . There is a general principle here that patient, praying believers are blessed by God with strength in their trials (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 12:8–10'>2Co 12:8–10</a> ). Yahweh also expected His people to be patient and await His coming in glory at the end to fulfill the promises of national deliverance, when believing Israel would become stronger than they had ever been. <a ref='Isaiah 41:1'>41:1</a> <b>Coastlands.</b> The coasts of lands around the Mediterranean Sea and the islands represent the nations. <b>gain new power.</b> Yahweh challenged the nations that refused to wait on Him to be silent in awe and then move to renew their strength (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 40:31'>40:31</a> ), meaning to collect their best arguments to plead their cause before Him. <a ref='Isaiah 41:2'>41:2</a> <b>one from the east.</b> Yahweh anointed Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, to accomplish His righteous will by conquering Babylon in 539 BC and allowing some of the Jewish exiles to return to Jerusalem (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 41:25'>41:25</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 44:28'>44:28</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 45:1'>45:1</a> ). He founded the Persian Empire and ruled from ca. 550 to 530 BC. <a ref='Isaiah 41:3'>41:3</a> <b>pursues … come with his feet.</b> Cyrus accomplished his conquests with great ease in territories he had never before visited. <a ref='Isaiah 41:4'>41:4</a> <b>first … last.</b> He existed before history and will exist after it (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 44:6'>44:6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 48:12'>48:12</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 1:17'>Rev 1:17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 2:8'>2:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 22:13'>22:13</a> ). <b>I am He.</b> It is legitimate to translate the two Hebrew words thus represented by “I am” (see also <a ref='Isaiah 42:8'>42:8</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 43:10'>43:10</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 43:13'>13</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 46:4'>46:4</a> ), a messianic title appropriated by Jesus frequently as explicit testimony to His deity (e.g., <a ref='Mark 13:6'>Mk 13:6</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:62'>14:62</a> ; <a ref='Luke 21:8'>Lk 21:8</a> ; <a ref='John 8:28'>Jn 8:28</a> , <a ref='John 8:58'>58</a> ; <a ref='John 13:19'>13:19</a> ). The title comes originally from Yahweh’s self-revelation to Moses in <a ref='Exodus 3:14'>Ex 3:14</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 41:5–7'>41:5–7</a> Instead of turning to Yahweh when they saw His anointed one, Cyrus, approaching, the nations turned to one another for help and made more idols. See <a ref='Isaiah 40:18–20'>40:18–20</a> regarding Isaiah’s description of idols and their makers. <a ref='Isaiah 41:8'>41:8</a> <b>Israel, My servant.</b> The faithful of the nation receive the honored corporate designation as the servant of Yahweh ( <i>see note on <a ref='Isaiah 20:3'>20:3</a></i> ). As His servant, they stood in bold contrast to the rest of the nations (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 41:5–7'>5–7</a> ). Cf. Israel as the servant in <a ref='Isaiah 42:18–25'>42:18–25</a> . <b>Abraham My friend.</b> “Friend” is an even higher designation than “servant” ( <a ref='John 15:14–15'>Jn 15:14–15</a> ; cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:7'>2Chr 20:7</a> ; <a ref='James 2:23'>Jas 2:23</a> ) and speaks of a greater faithfulness. <a ref='Isaiah 41:9'>41:9</a> <b>taken … from the ends of the earth.</b> In the last days, God will regather Israel from her worldwide dispersion as He did from Egypt and Babylon because Israel is God’s chosen nation (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 45:4'>45:4</a> ; <a ref='Amos 3:2'>Am 3:2</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 41:10'>41:10</a> <b>Do not fear.</b> Israel need not fear God’s destructive judgment, as the rest of the nations do (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 41:5'>5</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 41:13–14'>13–14</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 43:1'>43:1</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 43:5'>5</a> ), because He is their God and faithful to His promise to restore the nation. <a ref='Isaiah 41:11–13'>41:11–13</a> Through Yahweh’s help, the enemies of Israel were to be weakened and vanish ( <a ref='Isaiah 60:12'>60:12</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 12:3'>Zec 12:3</a> ) while God strengthened Israel. <a ref='Isaiah 41:14'>41:14</a> <b>worm.</b> This refers to the contempt of Israel by the ungodly nations, and the same term is used similarly of the Messiah on the cross ( <a ref='Psalms 22:6'>Ps 22:6</a> ). <b>Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.</b> The Hebrew for “Redeemer” refers to a near relative who has the opportunity and responsibility to buy back what a relative has lost ( <i>see note on <a ref='Ruth 2:20'>Ru 2:20</a></i> ). The term occurs 5 more times in connection with the title “Holy One of Israel.” <i>See notes on <a ref='Isaiah 43:14'>43:14</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 48:17–19'>48:17–19</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 49:7'>49:7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 54:5'>54:5</a></i> ( <i>cf. <a ref='Isaiah 47:4'>47:4</a></i> ). As Yahweh purchased His people from the bondage of Egypt by the blood of the Passover Lamb, He is to do the same from their worldwide exile by the blood of the True Lamb, Jesus Christ, when they turn to Him in faith (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–13:1'>Zec 12:10—13:1</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 41:15–16'>41:15–16</a> <b>mountains … hills.</b> Figurative representations of foreign nations, whom Israel is to grind into nothingness in the time of her kingdom, when the Lord Jesus sets Himself up as King in Jerusalem. <a ref='Isaiah 41:17–18'>41:17–18</a> <b>afflicted and needy.</b> Israel in her deprived state as a captive of foreign nations is spoken of as thirsty for blessing and joy.

As a person can’t see what is ahead because it is blocked by a “thick cloud,” so God obliterated the sins of those He redeemed. <b>Return to Me.</b> God has already provided for redemption, even before the cross, but based on it alone. For those who turn from sin and return to Him, there is redemption (because the purchase price for the sinner was paid by the sacrifice of Christ). Yahweh calls on His people to repent so they may receive the promised redemption (cf. <a ref='Nehemiah 1:9'>Ne 1:9</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 4:1'>Jer 4:1</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 24:7'>24:7</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:12'>Joel 2:12</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 1:3'>Zec 1:3</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 3:7'>Mal 3:7</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 3:2'>Mt 3:2</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 4:17'>4:17</a> ; <a ref='Romans 3:25–26'>Ro 3:25–26</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:15'>Heb 9:15</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 44:23'>44:23</a> <b>heavens … every tree … redeemed Jacob.</b> The national redemption of Israel at Christ’s second coming entails also the redemption of all nature ( <a ref='Romans 8:19–22'>Ro 8:19–22</a> ), so the prophet calls on the whole creation to rejoice. <a ref='Isaiah 44:25'>44:25</a> <b>boasters … diviners.</b> False prophets must suffer the consequences of their deceptive counsel ( <a ref='Isaiah 47:12–14'>47:12–14</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 13:1–5'>Dt 13:1–5</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 13:22'>Jos 13:22</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 27:9'>Jer 27:9</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 29:8'>29:8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 50:36'>50:36</a> ; <a ref='Micah 3:7'>Mic 3:7</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 44:26'>44:26</a> <b>His servant … His messengers.</b> In contrast with His breaking the word of false prophets (v. <a ref='Isaiah 44:25'>25</a> ), Yahweh confirmed the word of His true prophets such as of Isaiah ( <a ref='Zechariah 1:6'>Zec 1:6</a> ). Most specially, God confirmed the Word of the Messiah, who is the consummate embodiment of all the prophets and messengers of God ( <a ref='Malachi 3:1'>Mal 3:1</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 21:34'>Mt 21:34</a> , <a ref='Matthew 21:36–37'>36–37</a> ). <b>raise up her waste places.</b> The fall of Jerusalem came in 586 BC when the Babylonians invaded the Land. God promised to restore the Land to prosperity, the foretaste of restoration coming after 70 years with the help of the Persians ( <a ref='Isaiah 41:2'>41:2</a> ), but the greater restoration to come in Messiah’s kingdom. <a ref='Isaiah 44:27'>44:27</a> <b>Be dried up!</b> Yahweh demonstrated His power by drying up the Red Sea and the Jordan River when delivering His people from Egypt ( <a ref='Isaiah 43:2'>43:2</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 44:28'>44:28</a> <b>Cyrus … My shepherd.</b> The prophecy—given a century and a half before Cyrus lived and became king of Persia—predicted God’s use of the Persian king to gather the faithful remnant of Israel back to the land. In this role, Cyrus prefigured Yahweh’s Servant, who will shepherd the sheep of Israel in their final regathering ( <a ref='Micah 5:4'>Mic 5:4</a> ). The title “shepherd” applied to kings as leaders of God’s people ( <a ref='2 Samuel 5:2'>2Sa 5:2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 3:15'>Jer 3:15</a> ). In <a ref='Acts 13:22'>Ac 13:22</a> , Paul compares David to the standard of Cyrus’ obedience. <b>Jerusalem … the temple.</b> In 538 BC Cyrus decreed the rebuilding of the temple ( <a ref='Ezra 1:1–2'>Ezr 1:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 6:3'>6:3</a> ), thus fulfilling Isaiah’s prophecy. The returning Jews completed the work in 516 BC ( <a ref='Ezra 6:15'>Ezr 6:15</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 45:1–2'>45:1–2</a> <b>doors … gates … doors of bronze.</b> Probably this was a reference to the many gates in the city wall of Babylon which Cyrus entered with relative ease. The inner gates leading from the river to the city were left open, as were the palace doors. Herodotus, the Greek historian, reported that the openness of the city was so great that the Persians were taking prisoners as they moved to the palace in the center. <a ref='Isaiah 45:1'>45:1</a> <b>His anointed.</b> This word is the one translated from the Hebrew by the transliteration—“Messiah.” It is the word used for the messianic Redeemer King in <a ref='Psalms 2:2'>Ps 2:2</a> and <a ref='Daniel 9:25–26'>Da 9:25–26</a> , but here refers to Cyrus, as the king set apart by God’s providence for divine purposes. Though not a worshiper of Yahweh, the Persian monarch played an unusual role as Israel’s shepherd ( <a ref='Isaiah 44:28'>44:28</a> ) and God’s anointed judge on nations. <a ref='Isaiah 45:3'>45:3</a> <b>that you may know.</b> God intended Cyrus to be aware that the God of the Jews was giving him victorious conquests. According to Josephus, the Jewish historian, who indicated that Daniel influenced Cyrus with the prophecy of Isaiah, the king did know that the God of Israel was with him. <a ref='Isaiah 45:4'>45:4</a> <b>Jacob … have not known Me.</b> For His servant Israel’s sake, Yahweh raised up Cyrus, calling him by name, even though Cyrus did not have a personal relationship to Him. At some point, Cyrus certainly became aware of the true God and His sovereign control over human affairs, perhaps through the influence of Daniel (cf. <a ref='Ezra 1:1–4'>Ezr 1:1–4</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 45:6'>45:6</a> <b>from the rising to the setting of the sun.</b> This expression, meaning the whole earth, points to the fact that through the eventual, final regathering of Israel (of which Cyrus’ exploits were a foretaste), the whole earth will know Yahweh alone is God (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 43:10'>43:10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 44:6'>44:6</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 45:8'>45:8</a> <b>righteousness … salvation … righteousness.</b> Eventually Yahweh will cause righteous goodness to prevail throughout the world, just as He has promised Israel that it would (v. <a ref='Isaiah 45:13'>13</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 10:12'>Hos 10:12</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 45:9–10'>45:9–10</a> <b>Woe … Woe.</b> Figures of the potter and the clay and of parent and child show how absurd it is to contend with God over His plans for the future. This anticipated the objections by the Jews against 1) their captivity and restoration by a pagan king, and 2) ultimately God’s sovereign plan to redeem Gentiles as well as Jews worldwide (cf. <a ref='Romans 9:20–24'>Ro 9:20–24</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 45:11'>45:11</a> <b>Ask Me about the things that are to come.</b> Yahweh commands Israel to seek information about what He will do for the nation in the future, for He will reveal it. <a ref='Isaiah 45:12–13'>45:12–13</a> <b>I who made … He will build My city.</b> As the omnipotent Creator, God can save the nation through Cyrus as He has promised. <a ref='Isaiah 45:14'>45:14</a> <b>Egypt … Ethiopia … Sabeans.</b> Three countries to the south (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 43:3'>43:3</a> ) illustrate the worldwide submission to Israel that will prevail during the messianic kingdom age. <b>Surely, God is with you.</b> All nations will acknowledge the presence of the one true God among His people Israel ( <a ref='Isaiah 49:23'>49:23</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:14'>60:14</a> ). Paul the apostle found a fuller sense in these words when he advised the Corinthians on exercising prophecy rather than tongues in their meetings. This brought an acknowledgment from visitors of God’s presence among them ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 14:25'>1Co 14:25</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 45:15'>45:15</a> <b>hides Himself.</b> The contemporary situation hid God’s purposes of mercy toward Israel, i.e., that they would repent and He would eventually regather them and make Jerusalem the center of world attention (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 8:17'>8:17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 54:8'>54:8</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 57:17'>57:17</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 44:24'>Ps 44:24</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 45:16–17'>45:16–17</a> <b>Israel has been saved.</b> Makers of idols are to find disillusionment because of the failure of their gods to deliver, but Israel is to find eternal salvation in Yahweh ( <a ref='Isaiah 44:9–11'>44:9–11</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 45:19'>45:19</a> <b>not spoken in secret.</b> Unlike mysterious utterances of the false gods ( <a ref='Isaiah 8:19'>8:19</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 29:4'>29:4</a> ), God’s revelations through His true prophets are open and accessible. <a ref='Isaiah 45:21'>45:21</a> <b>Who has made this heard from of old?</b> Yahweh’s case to prove He is the only true God is unanswerable; only He foretold the captivity of Judah and the deliverance from that captivity, as well as other future events that happened just as He had predicted. <b>there is no other … There is none.</b> Yahweh restated the truth expressed by Moses in <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:35'>Dt 4:35</a> (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 43:10'>43:10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 44:6'>44:6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 45:6'>45:6</a> ). The scribe who asked Jesus about the greatest commandment cited this same principle in agreeing with Jesus’ answer to his question ( <a ref='Mark 12:32'>Mk 12:32</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 45:22'>45:22</a> <b>be saved, all the ends of the earth.</b> When the Messiah sits on His throne in Jerusalem, all people will enjoy His temporal salvation in the physical blessings of the millennial earth and will have opportunity for spiritual salvation ( <a ref='Isaiah 49:6'>49:6</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 45:23'>45:23</a> <b>every knee will bow.</b> In the kingdom age, all nations will worship the one true God of Israel. A further meaning, justified by the NT, applies this verse to believers’ accountability to God when He evaluates their works ( <a ref='Romans 14:11'>Ro 14:11</a> ). In assigning the words another meaning, Paul relates the words to the coming universal acknowledgment that “Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father” ( <a ref='Philippians 2:10–11'>Php 2:10–11</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 45:25'>45:25</a> <b>all the seed of Israel.</b> Physical descent from Abraham alone cannot bring justification. Only the faithful remnant of Israel will be saved (v. <a ref='Isaiah 45:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ). “Justified” means to be declared righteous, to be treated as if one is not sinful, but holy through the application of Christ’s righteousness to the one who believes (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 61:10'>61:10</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 46:1'>46:1</a> <b>Bel … Nebo.</b> The two most prominent gods in Babylon. “Bel” is another spelling for “Baal,” the Phoenician chief god of Babylon. That “Nebo” was extensively worshiped is shown by the proper names compounded from his: Nebuchadnezzar, Nabopolassar, and Nebuzaradan. <a ref='Isaiah 46:2'>46:2</a> <b>gone into captivity.</b> When Cyrus came, even the gods were taken into exile. These idols couldn’t save themselves from being laid down on the backs of beasts and hauled away, let alone save the people who worshiped them. <a ref='Isaiah 46:3–4'>46:3–4</a> <b>all the remnant of the house of Israel.</b> The God of Israel is not helpless like idols. In His strength He has sustained and will sustain helpless Israel through every circumstance. In v. <a ref='Isaiah 46:4'>4</a> , Yahweh uses the first person pronoun 6 times to emphasize His personal involvement in delivering Israel. <a ref='Isaiah 46:5–8'>46:5–8</a> The human origin and utter impotence of idols renders them unfit for comparison with the God of Israel ( <a ref='Isaiah 40:18–20'>40:18–20</a> ). In v. <a ref='Isaiah 46:8'>8</a> , the prophet calls on the readers to recall the impotence of the idols they worship in transgression of God’s law. <a ref='Isaiah 46:9'>46:9</a> <b>Remember the former things long past.</b> The readers are to recall: 1) all the past history of fulfilled prophecies, as well as 2) miraculous deliverances such as that from Egypt, and 3) providential blessings Israel has experienced. All of these are ample evidence that He alone is God. <a ref='Isaiah 46:11'>46:11</a> <b>man … from a far country.</b> Cyrus was this man whom God summoned to conquer Babylon and return a remnant of Israel to end the 70-year captivity a century and a half after Isaiah wrote this prophecy ( <a ref='Isaiah 44:28'>44:28</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 45:1'>45:1</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 46:13'>46:13</a> <b>righteousness … salvation in Zion.</b> At God’s appointed time, the salvation of Israel will become reality and result in the Messiah’s righteous kingdom ( <a ref='Isaiah 61:3'>61:3</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 62:11'>62:11</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:17'>Joel 3:17</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–13:1'>Zec 12:10—13:1</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 47:1–3'>47:1–3</a> <b>O virgin daughter of Babylon.</b> The prophet depicted Babylon as a virgin in the sense of never before having been captured. Babylon sat like a royal virgin in the dust, experiencing complete humiliation. The “throne” was gone, taken by Persian power, and the empire never recovered from being robbed of its power, its people, and its name. The former royal virgin is depicted as a slave woman forced to exchange royal garments for working clothes, who must lift her garment to wade through the water as she serves like a slave traversing the river in her duties. Such duties in the east belonged to women of low rank, fitting imagery for Babylon’s fall into degradation. <a ref='Isaiah 47:5'>47:5</a> <b>queen of kingdoms.</b> The title continues the analogy of v. <a ref='Isaiah 47:1'>1</a> and speaks of the exalted position from which Babylon was to fall. She was mistress of the world, but would later become a slave woman (cf. v. <a ref='Isaiah 47:7'>7</a> ), degraded by pride and false security (v. <a ref='Isaiah 47:8'>8</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 47:6'>47:6</a> <b>did not show compassion.</b> Though God was punishing Israel in captivity, Babylon’s cruel oppression of the captive Israelites was cause for the kingdom’s overthrow. Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 50:17–18'>Jer 50:17–18</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 51:33–40'>51:33–40</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 1:15'>Zec 1:15</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 47:7–9'>47:7–9</a> In <a ref='Revelation 18:7–8'>Rev 18:7–8</a> , <a ref='Revelation 18:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Revelation 18:16'>16</a> , <a ref='Revelation 18:19'>19</a> , John alludes to these verses in describing the downfall of Babylon just before Christ’s return. Compare “a queen forever” with <a ref='Revelation 18:7'>18:7</a> , “not sit as a widow” with <a ref='Revelation 18:7'>18:7</a> , and “in one day” with <a ref='Revelation 18:8'>18:8</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 47:8'>47:8</a> <b>no one besides me.</b> This pinnacle of Babylon’s pride was mockery of the true God in its frivolous presumption of deity (v. <a ref='Isaiah 47:10'>10</a> ; cf. <a ref='Isaiah 44:6'>44:6</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 47:9'>47:9</a> <b>suddenly in one day.</b> Babylon did not decay slowly, but went from being the wealthy lady, the unconquered virgin, the proud, invincible mother of many to a degraded, slave woman in the dust who lost her throne, her children, and her life. It happened in one night, suddenly and unexpectedly, when Cyrus and the Persian army entered the city (cf. <a ref='Daniel 5:28'>Da 5:28</a> , <a ref='Daniel 5:30'>30</a> ). <b>Loss of children and widowhood.</b> Babylon did lose its inhabitants, many of whom were killed and taken captive under Cyrus. This prophecy was fulfilled again when Babylon revolted against Darius; and in order to hold out in the siege, each man chose one woman of his family and strangled the rest to save provisions. Darius impaled 3,000 of the revolters. <a ref='Isaiah 47:10'>47:10</a> Sinners foolishly think they are safe, and there is none to judge them. Cf. <a ref='Psalms 10:11'>Pss 10:11</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 94:7'>94:7</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 47:11'>47:11</a> <b>evil … disaster … destruction.</b> The Persians under Cyrus suddenly initiated (cf. v. <a ref='Isaiah 47:9'>9</a> ) the visitation that ultimately obliterated Babylon. Its culmination is to come in conjunction with the destruction of a revived Babylon, the world headquarters of evil at the second coming of Christ ( <a ref='Isaiah 51:8'>51:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 18:2–24'>Rev 18:2–24</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 47:12'>47:12</a> <b>spells … sorceries.</b> The magical practices of Babylon, designed to aid against enemies (also v. <a ref='Isaiah 47:9'>9</a> ), will characterize the Babylon of the future also ( <a ref='Revelation 18:23'>Rev 18:23</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 47:13'>47:13</a> <b>Let now the astrologers … save you.</b> Babylon relied heavily on those who looked for combinations of stars, who watched conjunctions of heavenly bodies, who made much of months of birth, and who relied on the movements of stars to predict the future ( <a ref='Daniel 2:2'>Da 2:2</a> , <a ref='Daniel 2:10'>10</a> ). The prophet sarcastically points out the futility of such trust. This ancient deception is still popular today in the widespread use of horoscopes. <a ref='Isaiah 47:14'>47:14</a> <b>They cannot deliver themselves.</b> The astrologers were helpless to save themselves, much less the Babylonians who depended on them, or anyone else. The divine fire that came was not to be a fire to warm them, but to consume them. <a ref='Isaiah 47:15'>47:15</a> <b>none to save you.</b> When judgment comes, the astrologers with whom the people trafficked and spent their money will run to their homes, unable to save themselves or anyone else. <a ref='Isaiah 48:1–2'>48:1–2</a> <b>swear by the name of Yahweh … not in truth.</b> The people were nominally Israelites, but their hearts were far from God. This hypocrisy was common all through Israel’s history, even to the time of the Lord Jesus. Cf. <a ref='Matthew 23:3'>Mt 23:3</a> , <a ref='Matthew 23:13–39'>13–39</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 48:3–5'>48:3–5</a> Yahweh predicted events that have happened as He predicted them ( <a ref='Isaiah 41:2–4'>41:2–4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 46:10'>46:10</a> ), so the people would not ascribe these events to other gods. <a ref='Isaiah 48:3'>48:3</a> <b>former things.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Isaiah 46:9'>46:9</a> .</i> <a ref='Isaiah 48:6'>48:6</a> <b>new things.</b> From this point onward, the prophecies of Messiah’s first and second coming and the restoration of Israel have a new distinctiveness. Babylon becomes the Babylon of Revelation (v. <a ref='Isaiah 48:20'>20</a> ), and God uses Isaiah to communicate truths about the messianic kingdom on earth and the new heavens and new earth that follow it (e.g., <a ref='Isaiah 11:1–5'>11:1–5</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 65:17'>65:17</a> ). Verse <a ref='Isaiah 48:7'>7</a> indicates that God had never before revealed these features about the future. <a ref='Isaiah 48:9'>48:9</a> <b>For the sake of My name.</b> The nation Israel had no merit to prompt God’s favor toward them (v. <a ref='Isaiah 48:8'>8</a> ). They deserved wrath and death, but His mercy toward them originates in His desire to be glorified and His desire to display the integrity of His own name. <a ref='Isaiah 48:10–11'>48:10–11</a> <b>refined … tested.</b> Since Isaiah’s time, Israel’s testings have included the Babylonian captivity and present worldwide dispersion from her land; unlike silver purged in the furnace, the purging of Israel is not complete, and they are not refined. But God keeps up the afflictions until they are, so His name is not defamed through the destruction of Israel. The nation will be purged (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 13:1'>Zec 13:1</a> ). God’s plan is such that He alone, not man or man-made idols, will receive credit for Israel’s salvation ( <a ref='Isaiah 42:8'>42:8</a> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> , <a ref='Romans 11:33–36'>33–36</a> ). The adversaries of God are never to be given legitimate reasons for scoffing at God and His work. <a ref='Isaiah 48:14–15'>48:14–15</a> <b>him … he … His arm … him … him … his ways.</b> Beginning with v. <a ref='Isaiah 48:6'>6</a> , the prophet began to write of the new things. Babylon is the final one of <a ref='Rev 18'>Rev 18</a> , and the instrument of God’s judgment is Messiah. The pronouns refer to Jesus Christ, whom Yahweh will anoint to defeat the final Babylon at His second coming and bring Israel to her land and kingdom. That it is not Cyrus is also clear from the statement, “Yahweh loves him,” which is too strong to apply to the pagan king—but not to God’s Beloved, the Lord Jesus. <a ref='Isaiah 48:16'>48:16</a> <b>sent Me.</b> Here it was not the prophet who spoke, but the Messiah, the Servant of Yahweh whom the Lord God and the Holy Spirit will send for the final regathering of Israel and establishment of His kingdom as described in <a ref='Isaiah 61:1–7'>61:1–7</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 48:17–19'>48:17–19</a> Chastisements of Israel by the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel are for discipline ( <a ref='Isaiah 42:18–43:13'>42:18—43:13</a> ; cf. <a ref='Hebrews 12:10'>Heb 12:10</a> ). Some day they will end, when Israel heeds Yahweh’s commandments and God’s punishments will turn to prosperity. A future generation will do so and enjoy the refreshment of a continuous stream of God’s peace and righteousness that rolls over them like the relentless sea ( <a ref='Isaiah 65:18'>65:18</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 48:19'>48:19</a> <b>like the sand … like its grains.</b> Because of Israel’s disobedience, God’s promise to Abraham to multiply his descendants ( <a ref='Genesis 22:17'>Ge 22:17</a> ) has not yet been finally fulfilled. Even though the nation was temporarily set aside during the Babylonian captivity and during the dispersion before 1948 AD, and will suffer deadly assaults in the coming time of Jacob’s trouble (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 30:7'>Jer 30:7</a> ), God will be true to His promise. <a ref='Isaiah 48:20'>48:20</a> <b>Go forth from Babylon!</b> The worldwide proclamation of deliverance, along with the statement that “Yahweh has redeemed … Jacob” shows that it is not the return of a meager 50,000 Jews from historic Babylon while most stayed in that pagan land, but the final redemption of the nation as Zechariah spoke of it in <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–13:1'>Zec 12:10—13:1</a> and Paul in <a ref='Romans 11:1–2'>Ro 11:1–2</a> , <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>25–27</a> . A redeemed Israel is to make a complete separation from the final Babylon and its wicked system, and proclaim to the world Yahweh’s grace toward the nation. John repeats this command in <a ref='Revelation 18:4'>Rev 18:4</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 48:21'>48:21</a> <b>they did not thirst.</b> Isaiah pointed to the way that God miraculously provided for Moses’ generation, after He delivered them from Egypt ( <a ref='Exodus 17:6'>Ex 17:6</a> ; cf. <a ref='Isaiah 41:17–18'>Is 41:17–18</a> ), as an illustration of how He will provide for redeemed Israel when they escape the final world empire of Babylon. <a ref='Isaiah 48:22'>48:22</a> <b>no peace for the wicked.</b> Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 57:21'>57:21</a> . Not every Israelite will enjoy Yahweh’s salvation, but only the faithful remnant who have turned from their wicked ways. The wicked will be purged out before the kingdom of peace is established (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 13:7–9'>Zec 13:7–9</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 49:1–57:21'>49:1—57:21</a> This section defines the Messiah/Servant’s prophetic and priestly functions, His equipment for His task, His sufferings and humiliation, and His final exaltation. The word “servant” occurs about 20 times in this portion, which magnifies Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God who was slain to redeem God’s elect. <a ref='Isaiah 49:1–13'>49:1–13</a> The second of 4 Servant-songs (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 42:1–9'>42:1–9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 50:4–11'>50:4–11</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 52:13–53:12'>52:13—53:12</a> ). This one tells of the Servant’s mission and spiritual success. <a ref='Isaiah 49:1'>49:1</a> <b>from the womb … the body of My mother.</b> The whole world, including Gentiles (“islands,” “peoples from afar”) are called to recognize two significant points: 1) the Messiah/Servant will be a human being, born as others are of a woman, yet virgin born (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 7:14'>7:14</a> ; <a ref='Luke 1:30–33'>Lk 1:30–33</a> ), and 2) He will be an individual as distinct from a personified group such as the nation of Israel, which has also been called Yahweh’s servant ( <a ref='Isaiah 41:8–9'>41:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 42:19'>42:19</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 43:10'>43:10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 44:1–2'>44:1–2</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 44:21'>21</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 44:26'>26</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 45:4'>45:4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 48:20'>48:20</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 50:10'>50:10</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 49:2'>49:2</a> <b>My mouth like a sharp sword.</b> Yahweh has given power to His Servant to speak effectively and thereby to conquer His enemies ( <a ref='Isaiah 11:4'>11:4</a> ; cf. <a ref='Psalms 2:9'>Ps 2:9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 1:16'>Rev 1:16</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 2:12'>2:12</a> , <a ref='Revelation 2:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:15'>19:15</a> ). His Word is always effective ( <a ref='Isaiah 55:11'>55:11</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 6:17'>Eph 6:17</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 4:12'>Heb 4:12</a> ) <b>concealed Me.</b> Messiah, before His appearing, was hidden with God, ready to be drawn out at the precise moment (cf. <a ref='Galatians 4:4–5'>Ga 4:4–5</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 49:3'>49:3</a> <b>You are My servant, Israel.</b> That Yahweh’s use of the name Israel refers here to Messiah ( <a ref='Isaiah 42:1'>42:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 49:5–7'>49:5–7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 52:13'>52:13</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 53:11'>53:11</a> ) is explainable through the intimate relationship that exists between the nation and her King. <a ref='Isaiah 49:4'>49:4</a> <b>in vain … for nothing and vanity.</b> At His first coming, the Servant met with rejection by His nation. It may have appeared to some that His mission was a failure because of the suffering and rejection He endured (cf. <a ref='John 1:9–11'>Jn 1:9–11</a> ). The last two Servant-songs also emphasize the Servant’s suffering ( <a ref='Isaiah 50:4–11'>50:4–11</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 52:13–53:12'>52:13—53:12</a> ). But, though rejected by men, the Servant expresses His strong assurance that He is doing God’s work and will be rewarded with complete success. <a ref='Isaiah 49:5'>49:5</a> <b>back to Him … gathered to Him.</b> The Servant’s mission will include the priority of bringing Israel to Yahweh. Cf. <a ref='Matthew 10:5–6'>Mt 10:5–6</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 15:24'>15:24</a> ; <a ref='Romans 1:16'>Ro 1:16</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>11:25–27</a> . He will complete this at His second advent (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–13:1'>Zec 12:10—13:1</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 49:6'>49:6</a> <b>raise up the tribes of Jacob … My salvation may reach to the end of the earth.</b> The Servant’s goal is the salvation and restoration of Israel for the fulfillment of the covenant promise. But not limited to Israel, He is to function as a light bringing salvation to the Gentiles. Israel’s mission had always been to bring the nations to God ( <a ref='Isaiah 19:24'>19:24</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 42:6'>42:6</a> ). This she will finally do very effectively in the tribulation after the conversion of the 144,000 witnesses ( <a ref='Revelation 7:1–10'>Rev 7:1–10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:1–5'>14:1–5</a> ) and when she is restored to her land at the Servant’s return to earth. Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 9:2'>9:2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:10'>11:10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 42:6'>42:6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 45:22'>45:22</a> ; <a ref='Luke 2:32'>Lk 2:32</a> . Paul applied this verse to his ministry to the Gentiles on his first missionary journey ( <a ref='Acts 13:47'>Ac 13:47</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 49:7'>49:7</a> <b>despised … abhorred.</b> This speaks to the humiliating treatment of the Servant at His first advent, a theme emphasized by Isaiah ( <a ref='Isaiah 50:6–9'>50:6–9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 52:14–15'>52:14–15</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 53:3'>53:3</a> ). The “nation” is used collectively for all who reject Him, particularly Gentiles, who are the rulers, kings, and princes referred to as someday giving exalted treatment to the Servant at His second advent. Former oppressors will bow down to Him as in <a ref='Isaiah 52:15'>52:15</a> , because of the salvation of Israel. <a ref='Isaiah 49:8'>49:8</a> <b>acceptable time … day of salvation.</b> Messiah is represented as asking for the grace of God to be given to sinners. God gives His favorable answer in a time of grace (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 61:1'>61:1</a> ) when salvation’s day comes to the world (cf. <a ref='Galatians 4:4–5'>Ga 4:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 4:7'>Heb 4:7</a> ). At His appointed time in the future, Yahweh will, by His Servant, accomplish the final deliverance of Israel. Paul applied these words to his ministry of proclaiming the gospel of God’s grace to all people ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:2'>2Co 6:2</a> ). <b>a covenant of the people.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Isaiah 42:6'>42:6</a> .</i> When Yahweh saves and regathers Israel, they will return to the land, to which Joshua brought their ancestors after their exit from Egypt, now restored and glorious ( <a ref='Isaiah 44:26'>44:26</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 13:1–8'>Jos 13:1–8</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 49:9–10'>49:9–10</a> <b>bound … darkness … feed … pasture.</b> At the Messiah’s second advent, Israel’s condition will change from captivity and oppression to contentment and prosperity such as that enjoyed by a well-fed, protected, and watered flock of sheep. These ideal conditions will be enjoyed by the faithful remnant returning for their kingdom in Israel. John reveals that this condition is a foretaste of heaven ( <a ref='Revelation 7:16–17'>Rev 7:16–17</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 49:12'>49:12</a> <b>come from afar.</b> Israel’s regathering will be from a worldwide exile ( <a ref='Isaiah 43:5–6'>43:5–6</a> ), even far away places like Sinim, probably an ancient name for what is China. <a ref='Isaiah 49:13'>49:13</a> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 12:12'>Rev 12:12</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 49:14'>49:14</a> Here is the summary of the history of lament by the nation during its long period of suffering. Verses <a ref='Isaiah 49:15–23'>15–23</a> follow with words of assurance responding to the despondency. <a ref='Isaiah 49:16'>49:16</a> Yahweh is referring here to the Jews’ custom, perhaps drawn from <a ref='Exodus 13:9'>Ex 13:9</a> , of puncturing their hands with a symbol of their city and temple, as a sign of devotion (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:6'>SS 8:6</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 49:17–18'>49:17–18</a> <b>Your builders … put on … jewels.</b> Zion’s inhabitants will return as the city’s destroyers depart and will adorn the city. Israel will be the means of the conversion of the nations in the end (cf. <a ref='Romans 11:11–12'>Ro 11:11–12</a> , <a ref='Romans 11:15'>15</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 49:19–21'>49:19–21</a> After the faithful remnant is regathered in salvation, and Gentiles come to faith in the kingdom through Jewish witnesses, millennial Jerusalem will not be large enough to contain all her inhabitants. <a ref='Isaiah 49:22'>49:22</a> <b>nations … will bring your sons … your daughters.</b> The promise will find literal fulfillment as the nations of the world assist the faithful remnant of Israel to their land ( <a ref='Isaiah 14:2'>14:2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 43:6'>43:6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:4'>60:4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 66:20'>66:20</a> ). At the outset of the kingdom, when this regathering takes place, all the Gentiles will be believers in Jesus Christ who, by faith, escaped the wrath of the Lamb on the day of Yahweh and entered the kingdom ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 25:31–46'>Mt 25:31–46</a></i> ). Nations and leaders who throughout history oppressed Israel, will humble themselves before the redeemed people of God’s covenant, and Israel will know that waiting on Yahweh will not disappoint ( <a ref='Isaiah 8:17'>8:17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 40:31'>40:31</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 49:24'>49:24</a> <b>prey be taken … captives … be granted escape.</b> As in v. <a ref='Isaiah 49:14'>14</a> , Isaiah speaks of Zion again expressing her despondency over her captivity and wondering about deliverance. Yahweh replies again with encouraging words in vv. <a ref='Isaiah 49:25–26'>25–26</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 49:25–26'>49:25–26</a> <b>feed … with their own flesh … drunk with their own blood.</b> Strong language against Israel’s enemies reassures her of eventual deliverance from her exile. The angel of the waters draws on this terminology in celebrating the third bowl judgment in <a ref='Revelation 16:6'>Rev 16:6</a> . The destruction of Israel’s enemies, led by Satan in the tribulation (cf. <a ref='Revelation 12:15–16'>Rev 12:15–16</a> ), also fulfills this pledge. <a ref='Isaiah 49:26'>49:26</a> <b>all flesh will know.</b> God’s deliverance of Israel will be so dramatic that the world will recognize that Yahweh, the Savior, Redeemer, and Mighty One of Israel is the true God ( <a ref='Isaiah 11:9'>11:9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 45:6'>45:6</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 39:7'>Eze 39:7</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 2:14'>Hab 2:14</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 50:1'>50:1</a> <b>certificate of divorce … My creditors.</b> Though the sufferings of Judah were the necessary result of sin, no certificate of divorce or sale to creditors occurred because Zion’s separation from Yahweh was only temporary. In fact, God gave the non-Davidic northern kingdom a certificate of divorce ( <i>see note on <a ref='Jeremiah 3:8'>Jer 3:8</a></i> ). However, the unconditional promises of the Davidic Covenant ( <a ref='2Sa 7'>2Sa 7</a> ) precluded such a divorce for Judah, although there would be a time of separation (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 54:6–7'>54:6–7</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 50:2'>50:2</a> <b>Why…?</b> God asked why no one was willing to believe and obey Him, even after all had seen His redemptive power in Egypt, when He dried up the Red Sea ( <a ref='Exodus 14:21'>Ex 14:21</a> ), opened the river Jordan by turning it into dry land ( <a ref='Joshua 4:23'>Jos 4:23</a> ), and killed the fish in Egypt ( <a ref='Exodus 7:18–21'>Ex 7:18–21</a> ). Yahweh’s power to redeem was indisputable ( <a ref='Isaiah 59:1'>59:1</a> ). He proved it by His deliverance from Egypt ( <a ref='Isaiah 43:16–17'>43:16–17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 44:27'>44:27</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 46:9'>46:9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 48:3'>48:3</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 48:21'>21</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 50:4–11'>50:4–11</a> This is the third of 4 Servant-songs (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 42:1–9'>42:1–9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 49:1–13'>49:1–13</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 52:13–53:12'>52:13—53:12</a> ), and it is Messiah’s soliloquy about being perfected through obedience (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 50:4–5'>4–5</a> ) and sufferings (v. <a ref='Isaiah 50:6'>6</a> ). The apostle John writes much about Jesus’ obedience to God in fulfilling His will (cf. <a ref='John 5:19'>Jn 5:19</a> , <a ref='John 5:36'>36</a> ; <a ref='John 6:38'>6:38</a> ; <a ref='John 7:16'>7:16</a> , <a ref='John 7:29'>29</a> ; <a ref='John 12:49–50'>12:49–50</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Philippians 2:8'>Php 2:8</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 5:8'>Heb 5:8</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:7'>10:7</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 50:6'>50:6</a> <b>My back … My cheeks … My face.</b> The Servant remained obedient though provoked to rebel by excessively vile treatment. Jesus fulfilled this prophecy by remaining submissive to the Father’s will ( <a ref='Matthew 26:67'>Mt 26:67</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 27:26'>27:26</a> , <a ref='Matthew 27:30'>30</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:65'>Mk 14:65</a> ; <a ref='Mark 15:19'>15:19</a> ; <a ref='Luke 22:63'>Lk 22:63</a> ; <a ref='John 18:22'>Jn 18:22</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 50:7'>50:7</a> <b>set My face like flint.</b> So sure was He of the Lord God’s help that He resolutely determined to remain unswayed by whatever hardship might await Him (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:8–9'>Eze 3:8–9</a> ). Jesus demonstrated this determination in setting His face to go to Jerusalem to be crucified ( <a ref='Luke 9:51'>Lk 9:51</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 50:8–9'>50:8–9</a> No matter how He was mistreated, mocked, and repudiated, the Servant had full confidence of the Lord God’s support, so He welcomed an adversary to come. <a ref='Isaiah 50:10–11'>50:10–11</a> Here was a call to the unconverted to believe and be saved, along with a warning that those who tried to escape moral, spiritual darkness by lighting their own fire (man-made religion, works righteousness) were to end up in eternal torment. <a ref='Isaiah 51:1–2'>51:1–2</a> The prophet assured the nation of deliverance by pointing to God’s past covenant with Abraham ( <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> ), who was the rock in the quarry from which they were hewn as a people. Originally, Abraham was only one person, but God multiplied his descendants as He had promised ( <a ref='Genesis 13:16'>Ge 13:16</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 15:5'>15:5</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 17:5'>17:5</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 22:17'>22:17</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 51:3'>51:3</a> <b>waste places … Eden … desert … garden of Yahweh.</b> The same God whose power fulfilled His promises to Abraham is to transform Israel’s desolation into a primeval paradise, both nationally and spiritually, causing joy and songs of thanksgiving to ring from it. <a ref='Isaiah 51:4'>51:4</a> <b>law … justice … light of the peoples.</b> The Servant’s rule over Israel’s earthly kingdom is to cause righteousness to prevail for the benefit of all nations. <a ref='Isaiah 51:5'>51:5</a> <b>near … gone forth.</b> The Servant’s power to restore His people and bring justice, righteousness, and salvation to the world was at work, but God’s perspective differs from man’s reckoning of time. Though near by God’s reckoning in timeless eternity, the fruition of His deliverance was still many centuries from Isaiah’s day. The nations who survive judgment will trust in Him and enter His kingdom. <a ref='Isaiah 51:6'>51:6</a> <b>sky will vanish … earth will wear out.</b> This begins to take place in the time of tribulation (cf. <a ref='Revelation 6:12–14'>Rev 6:12–14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 8:12–13'>8:12–13</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:8–10'>16:8–10</a> , <a ref='Revelation 16:21'>21</a> ), setting the stage, along with the earthly judgments on land, sea, and fresh water (cf. <a ref='Revelation 6:14'>Rev 6:14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 8:6–11'>8:6–11</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:3–5'>16:3–5</a> ), for a renewed earth during the Millennium. The actual “uncreation” or destruction of the present universe, of which Peter wrote ( <a ref='2 Peter 3:10–13'>2Pe 3:10–13</a> ), occurs at the end of Christ’s millennial reign on the earth, when a new heaven and a new earth will replace the present creation ( <a ref='2 Peter 3:10'>2Pe 3:10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 21:1'>Rev 21:1</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 51:7–8'>51:7–8</a> Israel’s enemies will perish, but the Servant’s salvation will be permanent. <a ref='Isaiah 51:9–10'>51:9–10</a> This prayer for deliverance in the future was based on times past when Yahweh overcame Rahab, which was a term widely used to refer to things that wreak havoc, often, as in this case, Egypt (see <a ref='Psalms 87:4'>Ps 87:4</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 51:11–16'>51:11–16</a> Again, Isaiah summarized a constant theme: that instead of hearing dying men (v. <a ref='Isaiah 51:12'>12</a> ), Israel should trust the Creator of all things. He had delivered Israel in the past and is to do so permanently in the future before the nations can be destroyed (v. <a ref='Isaiah 51:14'>14</a> ), so they have no need to fear oppressors. The blessing of restored Israel will be evidenced in the joy of v. <a ref='Isaiah 51:11'>11</a> . Isaiah’s Description of Israel’s Future Kingdom Description Isaiah passages 1.

Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 51:6'>51:6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 65:17'>65:17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 66:22'>66:22</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 51:17–18'>51:17–18</a> <b>Jerusalem … drunk … cup of His wrath.</b> Jerusalem experienced Yahweh’s anger through her extended subservience to foreign powers with no human to deliver her (v. <a ref='Isaiah 51:18'>18</a> ), but the punishment will end (v. <a ref='Isaiah 51:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 40:1–2'>40:1–2</a> ; cf. <a ref='Isaiah 29:9'>29:9</a> ).

But, in contrast to Babylon, which drank the fury of God’s wrath to the last drop (v. <a ref='Isaiah 51:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 18:6'>Rev 18:6</a> ), Israel will have the cup removed before all the wrath is consumed.

Paul cited the blasphemy to Israel’s God that resulted from the hypocrisy of first-century Jews not applying to themselves the standards of God that they knew and taught others ( <a ref='Romans 2:24'>Ro 2:24</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 52:6'>52:6</a> <b>in that day I am the one.</b> After the day of Yahweh, when Israel experiences deliverance from her worldwide dispersion, she will recognize the fulfillment of prophecies through Isaiah and others and enjoy full assurance that Yahweh had spoken and fulfilled His promises of deliverance. They will connect these events with the great “I AM” ( <a ref='Isaiah 43:11'>43:11</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 3:13–15'>Ex 3:13–15</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 52:7'>52:7</a> <b>How lovely … good news.</b> Messengers will traverse the mountains around Jerusalem to spread the good news of the return of redeemed Israel to the land ( <a ref='Isaiah 40:9'>40:9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 61:1'>61:1</a> ; <a ref='Nahum 1:15'>Na 1:15</a> ). Paul broadened this millennial reference to the preaching of the gospel in the kingdom to include spreading the gospel of God’s grace from the time of Jesus Christ on ( <a ref='Romans 10:15'>Ro 10:15</a> ; cf. <a ref='Ephesians 6:15'>Eph 6:15</a> ). <b>good things … salvation … “Your God reigns!”</b> The good news pertains to the ideal conditions of Israel’s golden age, during which Christ will reign personally over His kingdom ( <a ref='Isaiah 24:23'>24:23</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 93:1'>Ps 93:1</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 52:8'>52:8</a> <b>with their own eyes.</b> See <a ref='Numbers 14:14'>Nu 14:14</a> . This Hebrew expression portrayed two people so close to each other that they can look into one another’s eyes. The point is that the messengers of the truth (“watchmen”) will see Yahweh return to Zion (a better translation) as vividly as they see each other looking eye to eye. <a ref='Isaiah 52:9–10'>52:9–10</a> <b>comforted … redeemed.</b> The ruined city will respond to the call to sing for joy because Yahweh has provided comfort ( <a ref='Isaiah 40:1–2'>40:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 49:13'>49:13</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 51:12'>51:12</a> ) and redemption ( <a ref='Isaiah 41:14'>41:14</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 43:1'>43:1</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 43:12'>12</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 43:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 44:6'>44:6</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 44:23–24'>23–24</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 47:4'>47:4</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 52:11'>52:11</a> <b>Depart, depart.</b> The prophet commands the Israelites to leave the lands of their exiles to return to Jerusalem ( <a ref='Isaiah 48:20'>48:20</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 50:8'>Jer 50:8</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 2:6–7'>Zec 2:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 18:4'>Rev 18:4</a> ). Under Cyrus there was only a limited return (50,000), but the final fulfillment in view here is in the future. <b>Touch nothing unclean … purify yourselves.</b> Returning exiles were not to defile themselves by taking property home from their exile (cf. <a ref='Joshua 6:18'>Jos 6:18</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 7:1'>7:1</a> ). The NT gave these prophetic words an application in principle by using them as an exhortation forbidding Christians to involve themselves with spiritual ties to forces of heathendom ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:17'>2Co 6:17</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 52:12'>52:12</a> <b>not go out in haste.</b> Delivered captives will not have to hurry in their return to Jerusalem, as their ancestors did when delivered from Egypt ( <a ref='Exodus 12:11'>Ex 12:11</a> , <a ref='Exodus 12:33'>33</a> , <a ref='Exodus 12:39'>39</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 16:3'>Dt 16:3</a> ).

This section contains unarguable, incontrovertible proof that God is the author of Scripture and Jesus is the fulfillment of messianic prophecy. The details are so minute that no human could have predicted them by accident, and no imposter fulfilled them by cunning. Clearly this refers to Messiah Jesus, as the NT attests (cf. <a ref='Matthew 8:17'>Mt 8:17</a> ; <a ref='Mark 15:28'>Mk 15:28</a> ; <a ref='Luke 22:37'>Lk 22:37</a> ; <a ref='John 12:38'>Jn 12:38</a> ; <a ref='Acts 8:28–35'>Ac 8:28–35</a> ; <a ref='Romans 10:16'>Ro 10:16</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:21–25'>1Pe 2:21–25</a> ).

The details cover the work of Christ in His substitutionary death, His burial, His resurrection, His saving of sinners, His intercession, and His kingdom. <a ref='Isaiah 52:13'>52:13</a> <b>high … lifted up … exalted.</b> Ultimately, when the Servant rules over His kingdom, He will receive international recognition for the effectiveness of His reign (cf. <a ref='Philippians 2:9'>Php 2:9</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 52:14'>52:14</a> <b>His appearance was marred.</b> The Servant must undergo inhuman cruelty to the point that He no longer looks like a human being. His appearance is so awful that people look at Him in astonishment ( <a ref='Isaiah 53:2–3'>53:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 22:6'>Ps 22:6</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 26:67'>Mt 26:67</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 27:30'>27:30</a> ; <a ref='John 19:3'>Jn 19:3</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 52:15'>52:15</a> <b>sprinkle many nations.</b> The verb can have the sense of causing them to spring up in astonishment. They are electrified—startled, so much so that they are left speechless. The context best supports this understanding of “startle.” <b>shut their mouths.</b> At His exaltation, human leaders in the highest places will be speechless and in awe before the once-despised Servant (cf. <a ref='Ps 2'>Ps 2</a> ). When He takes His throne, they will see the unfolding of power and glory such as they have never heard. Paul applied the principle in this verse to his apostolic mission of preaching the gospel of Christ where Christ was yet unknown ( <a ref='Romans 15:21'>Ro 15:21</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 53:1'>53:1</a> <b>Who has believed our report?</b> The question implied that, in spite of these and other prophecies, only a few would recognize the Servant when He appeared. This anticipation found literal fulfillment at Christ’s first advent. Israel did not welcome Him at His first advent ( <a ref='John 1:9–11'>Jn 1:9–11</a> ; <a ref='John 12:38'>12:38</a> ). Paul applied the same prophecy to the world at large ( <a ref='Romans 10:16'>Ro 10:16</a> ). <b>the arm of Yahweh.</b> At His first coming, the nation did not recognize the mighty, incarnate power of God in the person of Jesus, their Deliverer. <a ref='Isaiah 53:2'>53:2</a> <b>before Him.</b> Though unrecognized by the world (v. <a ref='Isaiah 53:1'>1</a> ), Messiah Jesus was observed carefully by God, who ordered every minute circumstance of His life. <b>parched ground … Nor appearance that we should desire Him.</b> The Servant will arise in lowly conditions and wear none of the usual emblems of royalty, making His true identity visible only to the discerning eye of faith. <a ref='Isaiah 53:3'>53:3</a> <b>despised … forsaken … despised.</b> The prophet foresees the hatred and rejection by mankind toward the Messiah/Servant, who suffered not only external abuse, but also internal grief over the lack of response from those He came to save (e.g., <a ref='Matthew 23:37'>Mt 23:37</a> ; <a ref='Luke 13:34'>Lk 13:34</a> ). <b>hide their face … we did not esteem.</b> By using the first person, the prophet spoke for his unbelieving nation’s aversion to a crucified Messiah and their lack of respect for the incarnate Son of God. <a ref='Isaiah 53:4'>53:4</a> <b>bore … carried.</b> Cf. vv. <a ref='Isaiah 53:11–12'>11–12</a> . Even though the verbs are past tense, they predict happenings future to Isaiah’s time, i.e., “prophetic perfects” in Hebrew here and elsewhere in this Servant-song. Isaiah was saying that the Messiah would bear the consequences of the sins of men, namely the griefs and sorrows of life, though incredibly the Jews who watched Him die thought He was being punished by God for His own sins. Matthew found an analogical fulfillment of these words in Jesus’ healing ministry ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 8:16–17'>Mt 8:16–17</a></i> ), because sickness results from sin for which the Servant paid with His life (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 53:7–8'>7–8</a> ; cf. <a ref='1 Peter 2:24'>1Pe 2:24</a> ). In eternity, all sickness will be removed, so ultimately it is included in the benefits of the atonement. <a ref='Isaiah 53:5'>53:5</a> <b>pierced through for our transgressions … crushed for our iniquities.</b> This verse is filled with the language of substitution. The Servant suffered not for His own sin, since He was sinless (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 4:15'>Heb 4:15</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 7:26'>7:26</a> ), but as the substitute for sinners. The emphasis here is on Christ being the substitute recipient of God’s wrath on sinners (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 1:3–4'>Ga 1:3–4</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:9–10'>Heb 10:9–10</a> ). <b>chastening for our peace.</b> He suffered the chastisement of God in order to procure our peace with God. <b>by His wounds we are healed.</b> The stripe (the Hebrew noun is singular) that caused His death has brought salvation to those for whose sins He died. Peter confirms this in <a ref='1 Peter 2:24'>1Pe 2:24</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 53:6'>53:6</a> <b>All of us … Each of us … us all.</b> Every person has sinned ( <a ref='Romans 3:9'>Ro 3:9</a> , <a ref='Romans 3:23'>23</a> ), but the Servant has sufficiently shouldered the consequences of sin and the righteous wrath deserved by sinners (cf. <a ref='1 Timothy 2:5–6'>1Ti 2:5–6</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 4:10'>4:10</a> ; <a ref='1 John 2:2'>1Jn 2:2</a> ). The manner in which God laid our iniquity on Him was that God treated Him as if He had committed every sin ever committed by every person who would ever believe, though He was perfectly innocent of any sin. God did so to Him, so that wrath being spent and justice satisfied, God could then give to the account of sinners who believe the righteousness of Christ, treating them as if they had done only the righteous acts of Christ. In both cases, this is substitution. <i>See notes on <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> .</i> <a ref='Isaiah 53:7–8'>53:7–8</a> This is the portion of Scripture read by the Ethiopian eunuch and subsequently explained to him by Philip as referring to Jesus ( <a ref='Acts 8:32–33'>Ac 8:32–33</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 53:7'>53:7</a> <b>did not open His mouth.</b> The Servant will utter no protest and will be utterly submissive to those who oppress Him. Jesus fulfilled this ( <a ref='Matthew 26:63'>Mt 26:63</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 27:12–14'>27:12–14</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:61'>Mk 14:61</a> ; <a ref='Mark 15:5'>15:5</a> ; <a ref='Luke 23:9'>Lk 23:9</a> ; <a ref='John 19:9'>Jn 19:9</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:23'>1Pe 2:23</a> ). <b>lamb … led to slaughter.</b> The Servant was to assume the role of a sacrificial lamb ( <a ref='Exodus 12:3'>Ex 12:3</a> , <a ref='Exodus 12:6'>6</a> ). Jesus fulfilled this figurative role literally ( <a ref='John 1:29'>Jn 1:29</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:18–19'>1Pe 1:18–19</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 5:6'>Rev 5:6</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 53:8'>53:8</a> <b>cut off … for the transgression of my people.</b> The Servant lost His life to be the substitute object of wrath in the place of the Jews, who by that substitution will receive salvation and the righteousness of God imputed to them. Similar terminology applies to the Messiah in <a ref='Daniel 9:26'>Da 9:26</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 53:9'>53:9</a> <b>with wicked men … with a rich man.</b> Because of His disgraceful death, the Jews intended the Servant to have a disgraceful burial along with the thieves (cf. <a ref='John 19:31'>Jn 19:31</a> ), but instead He was buried with “a rich man” in an honorable burial through the donated tomb of Joseph of Arimathea ( <a ref='Matthew 27:57–60'>Mt 27:57–60</a> ; <a ref='Mark 15:42–46'>Mk 15:42–46</a> ; <a ref='Luke 23:50–53'>Lk 23:50–53</a> ; <a ref='John 19:38–40'>Jn 19:38–40</a> ). <b>no violence … deceit.</b> The Servant’s innocence meant that His execution was totally undeserved. Peter notes the fulfillment of this in <a ref='1 Peter 2:22'>1Pe 2:22</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 53:10'>53:10</a> <b>Yahweh was pleased.</b> Though the Servant did not deserve to die, it was Yahweh’s will for Him to do so ( <a ref='Matthew 26:39'>Mt 26:39</a> ; <a ref='Luke 22:42'>Lk 22:42</a> ; <a ref='John 12:27'>Jn 12:27</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:23'>Ac 2:23</a> ). <b>a guilt offering.</b> Fulfilled by the Servant as the Lamb of God (v. <a ref='Isaiah 53:7'>7</a> ; <a ref='John 1:29'>Jn 1:29</a> ). Christ is the Christian’s Passover ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 5:7'>1Co 5:7</a> ). This conclusively eliminates the error that Christ’s atonement provides present-day healing for those who pray in faith. His death was an atonement for sin, not sickness. <i>See note on <a ref='Isaiah 53:4'>53:4</a> .</i> <b>see</b> His <b>seed … prolong</b> His <b>days.</b> To see His offspring, the Servant must rise from the dead. He will do this and live to reign forever ( <a ref='2 Samuel 7:13'>2Sa 7:13</a> , <a ref='2 Samuel 7:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 21:4'>Pss 21:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:4'>89:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 132:12'>132:12</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 53:11'>53:11</a> <b>He will … be satisfied.</b> The one sacrifice of the Servant will provide complete satisfaction in settling the sin issue ( <a ref='1 John 2:2'>1Jn 2:2</a> ; cf. <a ref='Isaiah 1:11'>1:11</a> ). <b>By His knowledge.</b> Knowledge of Him ( <a ref='Philippians 3:10'>Php 3:10</a> ), i.e., faith in Him ( <a ref='John 17:3'>Jn 17:3</a> ). <b>justify the many.</b> Through the divine “knowledge” of how to justify sinners, the plan was accomplished that by His one sacrifice He declared many righteous before God ( <a ref='Romans 5:19'>Ro 5:19</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 53:12'>53:12</a> <b>portion with the many… spoil with the strong.</b> The Servant’s reward for His work will be to enjoy the “booty” of His spiritual victories during His millennial reign. <b>numbered with the transgressors.</b> The Servant assumes a role among sinful human beings, fulfilled by Jesus when He was crucified between two criminals ( <a ref='Luke 22:37'>Lk 22:37</a> ). <b>interceded for the transgressors.</b> This speaks of the office of intercessory High Priest, which began on the cross ( <a ref='Luke 23:34'>Lk 23:34</a> ) and continues in heaven (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 7:25'>Heb 7:25</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:24'>9:24</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 54:1'>54:1</a> <b>barren … has not given birth … have not been in labor … desolate.</b> In her exile and dispersion, Israel has been destitute, disgraced as a woman who had borne no children ( <a ref='Isaiah 49:21'>49:21</a> ). The prophet calls for singing, however, because of Yahweh’s promise of future fruitfulness for the nation ( <a ref='Isaiah 49:19–20'>49:19–20</a> ). The NT supplies an additional application of the principle in this verse, citing it as evidence that the Jerusalem above, mother of the children of promise through Sarah, will enjoy great fruitfulness ( <a ref='Galatians 4:27'>Ga 4:27</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 54:2'>54:2</a> <b>Enlarge … Stretch out … Lengthen.</b> The prophet commanded barren Israel to prepare for the day when her numerous inhabitants will require larger space to dwell in ( <a ref='Isaiah 26:15'>26:15</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 49:19–20'>49:19–20</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 54:3'>54:3</a> <b>spread abroad … possess nations.</b> The Messiah’s future kingdom is to be worldwide, far greater in extent than the former kingdoms of David and Solomon. <a ref='Isaiah 54:4'>54:4</a> <b>shame of your virginity … reproach of your widowhood.</b> Israel’s sins brought on the Egyptian captivity, the Babylonian exile, and her current dispersion, but the glories of the future kingdom will be so great that they will overshadow past failures. <a ref='Isaiah 54:5'>54:5</a> <b>husband … Redeemer.</b> The basis for forgetting past failures is Israel’s relationship to Yahweh as her husband ( <a ref='Isaiah 62:4–5'>62:4–5</a> ) and Redeemer ( <a ref='Isaiah 41:14'>41:14</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 54:6–8'>54:6–8</a> <b>forsaken … grieved … rejected.</b> Israel in exile and dispersion has been like a wife whose husband has rejected her. But this is only for a brief time compared to the everlasting kindness she will enjoy when the Messiah returns to gather the woeful wife ( <a ref='Isaiah 26:20'>26:20</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 54:9'>54:9</a> <b>waters of Noah.</b> Just as God swore He would never again judge the whole earth with a flood ( <a ref='Genesis 8:21'>Ge 8:21</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 9:11'>9:11</a> ), so He has taken an oath never to be angry with His people again. He will fulfill this promise after their final restoration. <a ref='Isaiah 54:10'>54:10</a> <b>mountains … hills … My lovingkindness … My covenant.</b> In the Millennium ( <a ref='Isaiah 48:6–7'>48:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 51:6'>51:6</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 51:16'>16</a> ) topography will change (see <a ref='Ezekiel 38:20'>Eze 38:20</a> ; <a ref='Micah 1:4'>Mic 1:4</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:4'>Zec 14:4</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 14:10'>10</a> ), but not God’s pledge of well-being for Israel as a result of the New Covenant ( <a ref='Isaiah 55:3'>55:3</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 59:21'>59:21</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 61:8'>61:8</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 54:11–12'>54:11–12</a> <b>antimony … sapphires … rubies … crystal … precious stones.</b> The elaborate ornamentation will outfit Jerusalem to be the center of the future, eternal messianic reign following the Millennium ( <a ref='Revelation 21:18–21'>Rev 21:18–21</a> ). As magnificent as this is, it is not as important as the spiritual richness of the kingdom, when truth and peace (v. <a ref='Isaiah 54:13'>13</a> ) prevail along with righteousness (v. <a ref='Isaiah 54:14'>14</a> ). Yahweh Himself will teach everyone during the messianic kingdom, so everyone will know His righteousness ( <a ref='Isaiah 11:9'>11:9</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 31:34'>Jer 31:34</a> ). Jesus gave this verse an additional focus, applying it to those with spiritual insight to come to Him during His first advent ( <a ref='John 6:45'>Jn 6:45</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 54:15–17'>54:15–17</a> <b>Whoever attacks you will fall.</b> In the millennial kingdom this will occur, as prophesied by John in <a ref='Revelation 20:7–9'>Rev 20:7–9</a> . Yahweh will burn up all Israel’s enemies. The heritage of Yahweh’s servants in the Messiah’s kingdom will include His protection from would-be conquerors. It should be noted that after the Servant-song of <a ref='Is 53'>Isaiah 53</a> , Israel is always referred to as God’s “servants” (plural) rather than His servant ( <a ref='Isaiah 54:17'>54:17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 56:6'>56:6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 63:17'>63:17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 65:8–9'>65:8–9</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 65:13–15'>13–15</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 66:14'>66:14</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 55:1'>55:1</a> <b>Every one.</b> The Servant’s redemptive work and glorious kingdom are for the benefit of all who are willing to come ( <a ref='Isaiah 53:6'>53:6</a> ). The prophet invites his readers to participate in the benefits obtained by the suffering of the Servant in chap. <a ref='Is 53'>53</a> and described in chap. <a ref='Is 54'>54</a> . <b>no money … Without money … without cost.</b> Benefits in the Servant’s kingdom will be free because of His redemptive work ( <a ref='Isaiah 53:6'>53:6</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 53:8'>8</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 53:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:8–9'>Eph 2:8–9</a> ). <b>wine and milk.</b> Symbols for abundance, satisfaction, and prosperity ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:1'>SS 5:1</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:18'>Joel 3:18</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 55:2'>55:2</a> <b>not bread.</b> This is the “bread of deceit” ( <a ref='Proverbs 20:17'>Pr 20:17</a> ) and not the “bread of life” ( <a ref='John 6:32–35'>Jn 6:32–35</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 55:3'>55:3</a> <b>everlasting covenant.</b> The New Covenant that God will give to Israel ( <a ref='Isaiah 54:8'>54:8</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 61:8'>61:8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer 31:31–34</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 32:40'>32:40</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 50:5'>50:5</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 16:60'>Eze 16:60</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 37:26'>37:26</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 13:20'>Heb 13:20</a> ). <b>faithful lovingkindnesses of David.</b> The Davidic Covenant promised David that his seed would be ruler over Israel in an everlasting kingdom ( <a ref='2 Samuel 7:8'>2Sa 7:8</a> , <a ref='2 Samuel 7:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:27–29'>Ps 89:27–29</a> ). Paul connected the resurrection of Christ with this promise ( <a ref='Acts 13:34'>Ac 13:34</a> ), since it was an essential event in fulfilling this promise. If He had not fully satisfied God by His atoning death, He would not have risen; if He had not risen from the dead, He could not eventually sit on David’s earthly throne. But He did rise and will fulfill the kingly role (v. <a ref='Isaiah 55:4'>4</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 30:9'>Jer 30:9</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 34:23–24'>Eze 34:23–24</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 37:24–25'>37:24–25</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:25'>Da 9:25</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 3:5'>Hos 3:5</a> ; <a ref='Micah 5:2'>Mic 5:2</a> . The whole world will come to Him as the Great King (v. <a ref='Isaiah 55:5'>5</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 55:6–7'>55:6–7</a> Here is one of the clearest OT invitations to salvation now and kingdom blessing later. It gives an excellent example of how people were saved during the OT period. Salvation grace and mercy were available to the soul that was willing to 1) seek Yahweh ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:29'>Dt 4:29</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 15:4'>2Chr 15:4</a> ) and 2) call on Him while He is still available ( <a ref='Isaiah 65:1'>65:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 32:6'>Ps 32:6</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 8:17'>Pr 8:17</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 25:1–13'>Mt 25:1–13</a> ; <a ref='John 7:34'>Jn 7:34</a> ; <a ref='John 8:21'>8:21</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:2'>2Co 6:2</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 2:3'>Heb 2:3</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 3:13'>3:13</a> , <a ref='Hebrews 3:15'>15</a> ). Such true seeking in faith is accompanied by repentance, which is described as forsaking ways and thoughts and turning from sinful living to Yahweh. A sinner must come, believing in God, recognizing his sin and desiring forgiveness and deliverance from that sin. At the same time he must recognize his own inability to be righteous or to satisfy God and cast himself on God’s mercy. It is then that he receives a complete pardon. His sin has been covered by the substitution of the Messiah in his place (chap. <a ref='Is 53'>53</a> ). This OT pattern of salvation is illustrated in <a ref='Luke 18:9–14'>Lk 18:9–14</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 55:7'>55:7</a> <b>forsake.</b> An integral part of seeking Yahweh (v. <a ref='Isaiah 55:6'>6</a> ) is a turning from sin ( <a ref='Isaiah 1:16'>1:16</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 55:8–9'>55:8–9</a> <b>My thoughts … My ways.</b> Some may doubt such willingness as is described in v. <a ref='Isaiah 55:7'>7</a> , but God’s grace is far beyond human comprehension, especially as manifested toward Israel. <a ref='Isaiah 55:10–11'>55:10–11</a> <b>rain … snow … My word.</b> Moisture from heaven invariably accomplishes its intended purpose in helping meet human physical needs. The Word of God will likewise produce its intended results in fulfilling God’s spiritual purposes, especially the establishment of the Davidic kingdom on earth (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 55:1–5'>1–5</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 55:12'>55:12</a> <b>go out with gladness … led forth with peace.</b> Exiled Israel will return from her dispersion rejoicing in her deliverance and unbothered by her enemies. <a ref='Isaiah 55:13'>55:13</a> <b>Instead of the thorn … myrtle.</b> In the Davidic kingdom positive changes in nature, including the reverse of the curse ( <a ref='Genesis 3:17'>Ge 3:17</a> ), will be an ongoing testimony to Yahweh’s redemption of His people ( <a ref='Isaiah 44:23'>44:23</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:19–23'>Ro 8:19–23</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 56:1'>56:1</a> <b>about to come … revealed.</b> Incentives to comply with <a ref='Isaiah 55:6–7'>55:6–7</a> include the nearness of God’s kingdom of salvation and righteousness ( <a ref='Isaiah 51:5'>51:5</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 56:2'>56:2</a> <b>keeps from profaning the sabbath.</b> Sabbath observance, established after the deliverance from Egypt ( <a ref='Exodus 20:8–11'>Ex 20:8–11</a> ), became a sign of fulfilling the covenant God made with Moses ( <a ref='Exodus 31:13–17'>Ex 31:13–17</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 56:3'>56:3</a> <b>foreigner … eunuch.</b> Such individuals, excluded from Israel by the law ( <a ref='Exodus 12:43'>Ex 12:43</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:1'>Dt 23:1</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:3'>3</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:7–8'>7–8</a> ), will find in the coming of the messianic kingdom the removal of such exclusions. <a ref='Isaiah 56:4–5'>56:4–5</a> <b>hold fast My covenant … an everlasting name.</b> Eunuchs with hearts inclined to comply with the Mosaic Covenant may anticipate an endless posterity. It is never works that save (cf. <a ref='Romans 3:20'>Ro 3:20</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:8–9'>Eph 2:8–9</a> ); rather, obeying God’s law, doing what pleases Him or desiring to keep the promises of obedience are the evidences that one has been saved, and will thus enjoy all salvation blessings. <a ref='Isaiah 56:6–7'>56:6–7</a> <b>takes hold of My covenant … acceptable on My altar.</b> The foreigner who loves God, whose heart is inclined to serve Him and obey the Mosaic law, will find his sacrifices welcome, in the coming kingdom as well. <a ref='Isaiah 56:7'>56:7</a> <b>My house … for all the peoples.</b> In the kingdom of the Messiah, the Jerusalem temple will be the focal point for worship of Yahweh by people of all ethnic backgrounds. Jesus cited a violation of this anticipation by His contemporaries in His second cleansing of the temple: Jewish leaders had made the temple a commercial venture ( <a ref='Matthew 21:13'>Mt 21:13</a> ; <a ref='Mark 11:17'>Mk 11:17</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:46'>Lk 19:46</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 56:8'>56:8</a> others <b>… those</b> already <b>gathered.</b> Besides gathering Israel’s exiles into His kingdom, Yahweh will bring in non-Jews also ( <a ref='Isaiah 49:6'>49:6</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 56:9–12'>56:9–12</a> A commentary on Israel’s false prophets and irresponsible leaders who led them astray. <a ref='Isaiah 56:9–11'>56:9–11</a> <b>beasts … watchmen … shepherds.</b> These titles identify the wicked; other prophets refer to Israel’s enemies as beasts ( <a ref='Jeremiah 12:9'>Jer 12:9</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 34:5'>Eze 34:5</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 34:8'>8</a> ). Prophets, who should have been watchmen and warned Israel to repent, ignored their responsibility (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:17'>Eze 3:17</a> ). Priests also failed to lead Israel in paths of righteousness ( <a ref='Ezekiel 34:1–6'>Eze 34:1–6</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 11:15–17'>Zec 11:15–17</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 56:12'>56:12</a> <b>wine … strong drink.</b> This is indicative of the self-indulgent irresponsibility of the leaders. Drunkenness completely obliterated any concern that leaders had for their people. <i>See notes on <a ref='Proverbs 31:4–7'>Pr 31:4–7</a> .</i> <a ref='Isaiah 57:1–2'>57:1–2</a> In contrast to the evil leaders, who were engaged in debauchery and self-indulgence, were the righteous who were removed from impending divine judgments. The righteous do suffer by oppression and distress at what is going on around them, but they die in faith and enjoy their eternal reward. <a ref='Isaiah 57:3'>57:3</a> <b>soothsayer … adulterer … prostitute.</b> Sorcery and adultery were figurative designations for idolatry.

The splattered grape juice staining His clothing is, in reality, “blood” from those destroyed in judgment. John alludes to vv. <a ref='Isaiah 63:1–3'>1–3</a> in describing the second coming of Christ, the Warrior-King. <i>See notes on <a ref='Revelation 19:13'>Rev 19:13</a> , <a ref='Revelation 19:15'>15</a> .</i> <a ref='Isaiah 63:4'>63:4</a> <b>day of vengeance … My year of redemption.</b> The Messiah’s future reckoning with the wicked will coincide with His redemption of Israel ( <a ref='Isaiah 61:2'>61:2</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 63:5'>63:5</a> <b>no one to help … My own arm.</b> The future salvation of Israel will be a singlehanded accomplishment of Yahweh (v. <a ref='Isaiah 63:3'>3</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 59:15–16'>59:15–16</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 63:6'>63:6</a> <b>made them drunk.</b> See <a ref='Isaiah 51:17'>51:17</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 51:21–23'>21–23</a> . Revelation compares God’s wrath to wine several times (e.g., <a ref='Revelation 14:10'>Rev 14:10</a> , <a ref='Revelation 14:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:19'>16:19</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:15'>19:15</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 63:7–64:12'>63:7—64:12</a> As one of Israel’s watchmen, Isaiah, on behalf of the faithful remnant, prays this penitential confession and prayer for Israel’s restoration (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 62:6–7'>62:6–7</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 63:7–14'>63:7–14</a> The prayer reviews God’s compassionate acts toward His people in spite of their unfaithfulness to Him. <a ref='Isaiah 63:7–8'>63:7–8</a> <b>lovingkindnesses … lovingkindnesses.</b> All the plurals in this verse imply that language is inadequate to recite all the goodness and undeserved mercies God has showered on the nation time after time because of His everlasting covenant with them. By His elective choice, they became His people and He their Savior ( <a ref='Isaiah 43:1'>43:1</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 43:3'>3</a> ); this guarantees that they will not always be false, but someday true and faithful to God because of His sovereign election of them. Cf. <a ref='Ephesians 1:3–4'>Eph 1:3–4</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 63:9'>63:9</a> <b>angel of His presence.</b> The angel, who delivered the Israelites from Egypt, was none other than Yahweh Himself ( <a ref='Exodus 14:19'>Ex 14:19</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 23:20–23'>23:20–23</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 33:12'>33:12</a> , <a ref='Exodus 33:14–15'>14–15</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 20:16'>Nu 20:16</a> ). He is sometimes identified as the angel of Yahweh. He was close enough to His people that He felt their afflictions as if they were His own. <i>See note on <a ref='Exodus 3:2'>Ex 3:2</a> .</i> <a ref='Isaiah 63:10'>63:10</a> <b>rebelled … grieved His Holy Spirit.</b> In spite of Yahweh’s loving choice and sympathy, Israel continually turned their backs on Him and spurned His lovingkindnesses toward them ( <a ref='Numbers 20:10'>Nu 20:10</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 78:40'>Pss 78:40</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 106:33'>106:33</a> ; <a ref='Acts 7:51'>Ac 7:51</a> ; cf. <a ref='Ephesians 4:30'>Eph 4:30</a> ). Here is an illustration of the reality that the Holy Spirit is a Person, since only a person can be grieved. <a ref='Isaiah 63:11–13'>63:11–13</a> <b>His people remembered … did not stumble.</b> Yahweh, in spite of their perversity, did not forget His covenant nor fully forsake them ( <a ref='Leviticus 26:40–45'>Lv 26:40–45</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 106:45–46'>Ps 106:45–46</a> ). In contrasting their present state of destitution with that of blessing experienced by Moses’ generation, the people of Israel lamented the loss of God’s mighty works on their behalf and pleaded with Yahweh that He would not forsake them. <b>brought them up out of the sea … put His Holy Spirit in the midst of them … split the waters.</b> Letting the people pass through the sea on dry ground was a typical mighty work of God ( <a ref='Exodus 14:29–30'>Ex 14:29–30</a> ), and the Holy Spirit ministered among them ( <a ref='Numbers 11:17'>Nu 11:17</a> , <a ref='Numbers 11:25'>25</a> , <a ref='Numbers 11:29'>29</a> ). Another reference is made to the miracle of the Red Sea ( <a ref='Exodus 14:21–22'>Ex 14:21–22</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 63:14'>63:14</a> <b>make for Yourself a glorious name.</b> Yahweh’s purpose for Israel was and is to make them great so as to magnify His name in the world. Cf. v. <a ref='Isaiah 63:12'>12</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 63:15–19'>63:15–19</a> After having extolled God’s goodness (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 63:7–9'>7–9</a> ) and rehearsed God’s past faithfulness to Israel for the sake of His glory (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 63:11–13'>11–13</a> ), the prophet offered a prayer of repentance by the nation in its desolate condition. <a ref='Isaiah 63:15'>63:15</a> <b>Your compassion … toward me.</b> On behalf of the people, Isaiah asked if God had changed how He felt about Israel and prayed for new mercies such as He had exhibited toward the nation in the past. <a ref='Isaiah 63:16'>63:16</a> <b>Abraham … Israel.</b> The nation’s physical ancestors, Abraham and Jacob (Israel), played a crucial role in Jewish thinking. It had been the besetting temptation and sin of the Jews to rest on the mere privilege of descent from Abraham and Jacob (cf. <a ref='Matthew 3:9'>Mt 3:9</a> ; <a ref='John 4:12'>Jn 4:12</a> ; <a ref='John 8:39'>8:39</a> ), but at last they renounce that to trust God alone as Father. <a ref='Isaiah 63:17'>63:17</a> <b>cause us to stray … stiffen our heart.</b> The sense is that God allowed them to stray and be burdened in their hearts. They were not denying their own guilt, but confessing that because of it, God gave them up to the consequences of their iniquitous choices. Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 6:9–10'>6:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 81:11–12'>Ps 81:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 4:17'>Hos 4:17</a> ; <a ref='Romans 1:24–28'>Ro 1:24–28</a> . <a ref='Isaiah 63:18'>63:18</a> <b>sanctuary … trodden … down.</b> The Babylonians, among others, had possessed the land given to Israel and desecrated God’s sanctuary ( <a ref='Psalms 74:3–7'>Ps 74:3–7</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 63:19'>63:19</a> <b>never … not called.</b> Israel’s complaint was that her desolate condition was comparable to that of nations who had no unique relationship with Yahweh. <a ref='Isaiah 64:1–5'>64:1–5</a> A plea for Yahweh to demonstrate His power as He did in earlier days. <a ref='Isaiah 64:1–2'>64:1–2</a> <b>rend the heavens … quake at Your presence.</b> Israel’s response to her own complaint ( <a ref='Isaiah 63:19'>63:19</a> ) was a plea that God would burst forth to execute vengeance suddenly on His people’s foes (cf. <a ref='Psalms 18:7–9'>Pss 18:7–9</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 144:5'>144:5</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 3:5–6'>Hab 3:5–6</a> ), manifesting Himself in judgment again as He did at Mt. Sinai ( <a ref='Exodus 19:18'>Ex 19:18</a> ; <a ref='Judges 5:5'>Jdg 5:5</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 68:8'>Ps 68:8</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 12:18–20'>Heb 12:18–20</a> ). As God’s name is to receive glory through His redemption of Israel ( <a ref='Isaiah 63:14'>63:14</a> ), it also is to have widespread recognition because of His judgment against Israel’s enemies ( <a ref='Psalms 99:1'>Ps 99:1</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 64:3'>64:3</a> <b>awesome things.</b> Another reference to God’s acts at Sinai ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:21'>Dt 10:21</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 64:4'>64:4</a> <b>ear … eye.</b> God’s judgmental manifestations are unique. No one has witnessed the likes of His awesome works on behalf of His own. Paul adapts words from this verse to speak of direct revelation of God imparted to His apostles and prophets and pertaining to mysteries hidden from mankind before the birth of the church ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:9'>1Co 2:9</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 64:5'>64:5</a> <b>shall we be saved?</b> Direct exposure to the awesome character of God’s judgment brings a realization of sinners’ need of salvation (cf. <a ref='Acts 16:26–30'>Ac 16:26–30</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 64:6'>64:6</a> <b>unclean … filthy garment.</b> As in <a ref='Isaiah 53:6'>53:6</a> , the prophet included himself among those confessing their utter unworthiness to be in God’s presence. Isaiah employed the imagery of menstrual cloths used during a woman’s period to picture uncleanness (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 15:19–24'>Lv 15:19–24</a> ). This is true of the best behavior of unbelievers (cf. <a ref='Philippians 3:5–8'>Php 3:5–8</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 64:7–9'>64:7–9</a> <b>no one who calls.</b> The prophet finds no exception among a people whose iniquities had separated them from God. <i>See notes on <a ref='Romans 3:10–18'>Ro 3:10–18</a> .</i> Such seeking and calling on Yahweh as Isaiah describes in <a ref='Isaiah 55:6–7'>55:6–7</a> cannot occur apart from the powerful conviction and awakening of the sinful heart by the Holy Spirit. Thus the prayer recognizes God as a potter in control of clay and pleads for Him to do a saving work (v. <a ref='Isaiah 64:8'>8</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Isaiah 45:9–10'>45:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:21'>60:21</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 63:16'>63:16</a> . Such a work is what God promised to end His fury ( <a ref='Isaiah 54:7–8'>54:7–8</a> ) and His memory of sin (v. <a ref='Isaiah 64:9'>9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 43:25'>43:25</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 64:11'>64:11</a> <b>burned</b> by <b>fire … become a waste place.</b> Through prophetic revelation Isaiah uttered these words many years before the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple in 586 BC. Yet, he lamented over the fallen state as though it had already occurred. God’s people were in desperate straits and their prayers urgent and persistent: “How can You stand by when Your people and Your land are so barren?” <a ref='Isaiah 65:1–7'>65:1–7</a> In response to the prayer of <a ref='Isaiah 63:7–64:12'>63:7—64:12</a> , Yahweh repeated the warnings of His judgment. <a ref='Isaiah 65:1'>65:1</a> <b>not ask … not seek … not call.</b> Though Israel sought Yahweh, they did so only superficially. They did not genuinely seek Him. The NT assigns an additional sense to the words in <a ref='Romans 10:20'>Ro 10:20</a> , applying them to Gentiles who find Him through the work of His sovereign grace. <a ref='Isaiah 65:2'>65:2</a> <b>I have spread out … rebellious people.</b> God had continually taken the initiative in inviting His people Israel to walk in His ways, but time after time they rebuffed Him. Using this verse, Paul concurred in citing the rebelliousness of his fellow Jews ( <a ref='Romans 10:21'>Ro 10:21</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 65:3–4'>65:3–4</a> Here Isaiah gave more references to Israel’s sin, such as defiance in practicing idolatry, communing with the spirits of the dead (a forbidden practice according to <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:10–11'>Dt 18:10–11</a> ), eating in ways forbidden by the Mosaic law ( <a ref='Leviticus 11:7–8'>Lv 11:7–8</a> ), consuming food connected with idol sacrifices, and the arrogance of self-righteousness (cf. <a ref='Matthew 9:11'>Mt 9:11</a> ; <a ref='Luke 5:30'>Lk 5:30</a> ; <a ref='Luke 18:11'>18:11</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 65:5'>65:5</a> <b>smoke in My nostrils.</b> This alluded to the smoke of their self-righteous sacrifices, an endless irritation to God who responds in judgment. <a ref='Isaiah 65:6'>65:6</a> <b>I will not keep silent.</b> Yahweh’s response to the prayer asking Him not to restrain Himself in granting deliverance ( <a ref='Isaiah 64:12'>64:12</a> ) was that He will act in judgment, not deliverance, to punish sin (v. <a ref='Isaiah 64:7'>7</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 65:8–10'>65:8–10</a> In the midst of the final fury of judgment when the time of Jacob’s trouble comes (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 30:7'>Jer 30:7</a> ) and God purges out the rebels in Israel (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 20:38'>Eze 20:38</a> ), there will also be the restoration of the faithful remnant to the land. Though judgment comes to the nation as a whole, God will spare and save (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 12:10–13:1'>Zec 12:10—13:1</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ) the faithful remnant, “survivors” ( <a ref='Isaiah 1:9'>1:9</a> ), in the future kingdom. This will include a physical return of God’s elect, believing Jews, to the land of Israel ( <a ref='Isaiah 57:13'>57:13</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 65:10'>65:10</a> <b>Sharon … valley of Achor.</b> Sharon was the western fertile territory on the Mediterranean coast, south of Mt. Carmel ( <a ref='Isaiah 35:2'>35:2</a> ). The eastern Valley of Achor was near Jericho and the Jordan River ( <a ref='Joshua 7:24'>Jos 7:24</a> , <a ref='Joshua 7:26'>26</a> ). Together they represented the whole land. <a ref='Isaiah 65:11–12'>65:11–12</a> Another pronouncement of judgment was given on the rebellious Israelites, who resorted to the worship of pagan gods, like Fortune (Hebrew Gad) and Destiny (Hebrew Meni), and had no one to blame but themselves for the sword of damnation that fell on them. <a ref='Isaiah 65:13–14'>65:13–14</a> Continuing to address the rebel idolaters, Yahweh Himself gave contrasts between the faithful and unfaithful of Israel. <a ref='Isaiah 65:15'>65:15</a> <b>your name for a curse … another name.</b> Israel’s new name was to reflect her favored status among the nations ( <a ref='Isaiah 62:2–4'>62:2–4</a> ). Delinquent Israelites, on the other hand, were to endure the reproach of men, so that the very name “Jew” would be disclaimed. <a ref='Isaiah 65:16'>65:16</a> <b>God of truth.</b> Lit. this is “God of Amen,” referring to the very God, the True God, who will honor His promises to Israel, thus vindicating Himself in the eyes of all people. Someday the rebels will be purged out, and the redeemed remnant will be left. In that time, all blessing and swearing will be by the one and only True God, because all idols will be vanquished and forgotten in the glory of the kingdom of Messiah. <a ref='Isaiah 65:17–25'>65:17–25</a> The blessings of faithful Israel in the coming kingdom are described. <a ref='Isaiah 65:17'>65:17</a> <b>new heavens and a new earth.</b> Israel’s future kingdom will include a temporal kingdom of a thousand years ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Revelation 20:1–10'>Rev 20:1–10</a></i> ) and an eternal kingdom in God’s new creation ( <a ref='Isaiah 51:6'>51:6</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 51:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 54:10'>54:10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 66:22'>66:22</a> ; cf. <a ref='Revelation 21:1–8'>Rev 21:1–8</a> ). The prophet uses the eternal kingdom here as a reference point for both. Isaiah’s prophecy does not make clear the relationship between the kingdom’s two aspects as does later prophecy ( <a ref='Revelation 20:1–21:8'>Rev 20:1—21:8</a> ). This is similar to the compression of Christ’s first and second advents, so that in places they are indistinguishable (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 61:1–2'>61:1–2</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 65:20'>65:20</a> <b>No longer will … an infant … Or an old man.</b> Long life will prevail in the millennial kingdom. In the temporal phase of the kingdom, death will happen, but not nearly so early as in the time of Isaiah. <b>accursed.</b> In the millennial phase of Israel’s kingdom, a sinful person may die at age 100, but will be considered a mere youth at the time of his premature death. Having died an untimely death at such a youthful time, it will be assumed that God has taken his life for sin. The curse will be reversed in the Millennium, but it will not be removed until the eternal state (cf. <a ref='Revelation 22:3'>Rev 22:3</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 65:21–22'>65:21–22</a> <b>build … inhabit … plant … eat.</b> Social justice will prevail in Israel’s kingdom. No enemies will deprive people of what is rightfully theirs (contra. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:30'>Dt 28:30</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 65:23'>65:23</a> <b>for terror.</b> Lit. this means “for sudden death.” Subjects in the kingdom will enjoy freedom from ordinary misfortunes related to the premature death of infants. There will be the lowest infant mortality rate ever. Along with longer life (v. <a ref='Isaiah 65:20'>20</a> ), this means the earth will be greatly populated at an exponential rate of reproduction. Cf. <a ref='Revelation 20:7–9'>Rev 20:7–9</a> for the massive collection of people at the end of the kingdom who come against Christ. <a ref='Isaiah 65:24'>65:24</a> <b>before they call … while they are still speaking.</b> Relationship with Yahweh will be so close that He will anticipate and provide for every need ( <a ref='Isaiah 58:9'>58:9</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 65:25'>65:25</a> <b>wolf … lamb … lion … ox … serpent’s.</b> Dangers from the animal world will be nonexistent during the reign of the Servant of Yahweh ( <a ref='Isaiah 11:6–9'>11:6–9</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 66:1–2'>66:1–2</a> Isaiah began the final summary of his prophecy with a reminder that God is not looking for a temple of stone, since as Creator of all things, the whole universe is His dwelling place. Stephen cited this passage before the Sanhedrin to point out their error in limiting God to a temple made with hands ( <a ref='Acts 7:49–50'>Ac 7:49–50</a> ). On the contrary, God is looking for a heart to dwell in, a heart that is tender and broken, not one concerned with the externalities of religion (cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:3–9'>Mt 5:3–9</a> ). God is looking to dwell in the heart of a person who takes His Word seriously (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 66:5'>66:5</a> ; <a ref='John 14:23'>Jn 14:23</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 66:3'>66:3</a> <b>the one who strikes down a man.</b> God loathes even the sacrifices of the wicked (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 15:8'>Pr 15:8</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 28:9'>28:9</a> ). They often killed children to offer in sacrifice (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 23:39'>Eze 23:39</a> ). Some of the Jews were offering bulls as sacrifices with the same empty heartedness as the pagans offering “a man” on the altar. <b>breaks a dog’s neck.</b> This refers to offering dogs in sacrifice, which, as unclean ( <a ref='Jeremiah 15:3'>Jer 15:3</a> ; cf. <a ref='Isaiah 56:10–11'>56:10–11</a> ), are associated with swine ( <a ref='Matthew 7:6'>Mt 7:6</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 2:22'>2Pe 2:22</a> ). To sacrifice a lamb with an attitude no different than if it were a dog betrayed the empty-heartedness of the offerer. All of these images are meant to illustrate the shallow hypocrisy of one who makes an offering to God, but with no more heartbrokenness than a pagan who kills a child, offers a dog, sacrifices pig’s blood, blesses an idol, and loves such abominations. God will judge such (v. <a ref='Isaiah 66:4'>4</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 66:5'>66:5</a> <b>Your brothers who hate you.</b> The apostate Israelites intensified their rivalry with the faithful remnant ( <a ref='Isaiah 65:11–15'>65:11–15</a> ) and blasphemously said, “Let Yahweh be glorified,” words uttered in the sarcastic spirit of <a ref='Isaiah 5:19'>5:19</a> by these apostates. In the end, “they will be put to shame” because God’s judgment will fall. <a ref='Isaiah 66:7–9'>66:7–9</a> Here is another comparison with the human birth process (see <a ref='Isaiah 13:8'>13:8</a> ), this time to teach two lessons: 1) no birth can come until labor pains have occurred (vv. <a ref='Isaiah 66:7–8'>7–8</a> ); and 2) when labor occurs, birth will surely follow (v. <a ref='Isaiah 66:9'>9</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 30:6–7'>Jer 30:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:8'>Mt 24:8</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:3'>1Th 5:3</a> . The point is that Israel’s suffering will end with a delivery! Yahweh will not impose travail on the remnant without bringing them to the kingdom (v. <a ref='Isaiah 66:10'>10</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 66:11'>66:11</a> <b>nurse and be satisfied.</b> The prophet compares Jerusalem to a nursing mother. <a ref='Isaiah 66:12'>66:12</a> <b>peace … like a river.</b> The picture is of abundant peace that compares to a wadi filled with a rushing torrent of water. <a ref='Isaiah 66:14'>66:14</a> <b>to His slaves … toward His enemies.</b> Prosperity will belong to the faithful remnant, but wrath to those who oppose Yahweh. <a ref='Isaiah 66:15'>66:15</a> <b>whirlwind … flames of fire.</b> That the wrath of God will come to the rebels is expressed in language describing the end-time judgment (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 29:6'>29:6</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 66:16'>66:16</a> <b>slain … will be many.</b> The many who fight against Yahweh when He comes to establish His kingdom will die ( <a ref='Isaiah 34:6–7'>34:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:21'>Rev 19:21</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 66:17'>66:17</a> <b>sanctify and purify themselves.</b> Sanctification and purification for right purposes are right, but when done for purposes of idol worship, will draw judgment from the one true God. <a ref='Isaiah 66:18'>66:18</a> <b>their works and their thoughts.</b> Yahweh was aware of the motivations behind the actions of apostate Israelites (v. <a ref='Isaiah 66:17'>17</a> ). <b>gather all nations and tongues.</b> See <a ref='Isaiah 2:2–4'>2:2–4</a> . Jerusalem will be the center of world attention because of the presence of the Messiah there. <a ref='Isaiah 66:19'>66:19</a> <b>those who have escaped.</b> The faithful remnant of Israel are in view, who had escaped both the persecutions of their enemies and the judgment of God against those enemies (v. <a ref='Isaiah 66:16'>16</a> ). <b>Tarshish, Put, Lud … Tubal, and Javan.</b> Tarshish was possibly in Spain, Put and Lud in North Africa, Tubal in northeast Asia Minor, and Javan in Greece. These were representative Gentile populations that will hear of God’s glory through the faithful remnant. <a ref='Isaiah 66:20'>66:20</a> <b>bring all your brothers.</b> As their offering to Yahweh, the Gentiles who hear of God’s glory will expedite the return of Israel’s faithful remnant ( <a ref='Isaiah 43:6'>43:6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 49:22'>49:22</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 66:21'>66:21</a> <b>for priests</b> and <b>for Levites.</b> Some of the returning remnant will function in these specialized roles in the services of the millennial temple and memorial sacrifices (cf. <a ref='Eze 44-46'>Eze 44–46</a> ). <a ref='Isaiah 66:22'>66:22</a> <b>your seed … endure.</b> National Israel will have a never-ending existence through the Millennium, and on into the new heavens and the new earth throughout eternity. <a ref='Isaiah 66:23'>66:23</a> <b>All mankind … worship before Me.</b> All humanity will participate in worshiping Yahweh at stipulated times during the temporal phase of the messianic kingdom. <a ref='Isaiah 66:24'>66:24</a> <b>worm will not die … fire will not be quenched.</b> The corpses of those enduring everlasting torment will serve as a vivid reminder to all of the grievous nature and terrible consequences of rebellion against God. In referring to this verse, Jesus referred to the Valley of Hinnom—i.e., Gehenna—where a continually burning trash-heap pictured the never-ending pain of the lost ( <a ref='Mark 9:47–48'>Mk 9:47–48</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Jeremiah 19:6'>Jer 19:6</a> .</i>",
