Distinct from saving faith or persevering faith, both of which all believers possess, this gift is exercised in persistent prayer and endurance in intercession, along with a strong trust in God in the midst of difficult circumstances (cf. Mt 17:20 ). healing. A temporary sign gift used by Christ ( Mt 8:16–17 ), the apostles ( Mt 10:1 ), the seventy ( Lk 10:1 ), and a few associates of the apostles, such as Philip ( Ac 8:5–7 ). This ability was identified as a gift belonging to the apostles (cf. 2Co 12:12 ). Although Christians today do not have the gifts of healings, God certainly still hears and answers the faithful prayers of His children (see Jas 5:13–16 ). Some people feel that healing should be common and expected in every era, but this is not the case. Physical healings are very rare throughout the OT record. Only a few are recorded. There was never a time before the coming of Christ when healings were common. Only in His lifetime and that of His apostles was there a veritable explosion of healing. This was due to the unique need to accredit the Messiah and to authenticate the first miracles of the gospel. Jesus and His apostles temporarily banished disease from Israel, but that was the most monumental era of redemptive history and called for such authentication. To normalize healing would be to normalize the arrival of the Savior. This gift belonged to the sign gifts for that era only. The gifts of healings were never used solely for bringing people physical health. Paul was sick but never healed himself or asked another human to heal him. His friend Epaphroditus was near death ( Php 2:27 ), and Paul did not heal him. God intervened. When Timothy was sick, Paul did not heal him, but told him to take some wine ( 1Ti 5:23 ). Paul left Trophimus “sick at Miletus” ( 2Ti 4:20 ). Healings were not the everyday norm in Paul’s ministry, but did occur when he entered a new region, e.g., Malta, where the gospel and its preacher needed authentication (see Ac 28:8–9 ). That healing was the first mention of healing since the lame man was healed in Lystra ( Ac 14:9 ) in connection with the arrival of Paul and the gospel there. Prior to that, the nearest healing was by Peter in Ac 9:34 , and the resurrection of Tabitha in 9:41 , so that people would believe the gospel Peter preached ( 9:42 )."

This temporary sign gift was for the working of divine acts contrary to nature, so that there was no explanation for the action except that it was by the power of God. This, too, was to authenticate Christ and the apostolic preachers of the gospel. John 2:11 notes that Jesus did His first miracle at Cana to “manifest His glory,” not enhance the party (cf. John’s purpose for recording the miracles of Jesus in this Gospel, 20:30–31 ). Ac 2:22 affirms that Jesus did miracles to “attest” that God was working through Him, so that people would believe in Him as Lord and Savior. Jesus performed miracles and healed only for the 3 years of His ministry, not at all in the 30 years before. His miracles began when His ministry began. Though Jesus did miracles related to nature (made wine, created food, walked on water with Peter, ascended), no apostle ever is reported to have done a miracle in the natural realm. What miracle did the apostles do? The answer is in the word “miracles,” meaning “power,” and is frequently connected to casting out demons ( Lk 4:36 ; 6:18 ; 9:42 ). It is precisely that power that the Lord gave the disciples ( Lk 9:1 ; 10:17–19 ; cf. Ac 6:8 ; 8:7 ; 13:6–12 ). See notes on Ac 19:14–16 . prophecy. The meaning is simply that of “speaking forth,” or “proclaiming publicly” to which the connotation of prediction was added sometime in the Middle Ages. Since the completion of Scripture, prophecy has not been a means of new revelation, but is limited to proclaiming what has already been revealed in the written Word. Even the biblical prophets were preachers, proclaimers of God’s truth both by revelation and reiteration. Old Testament prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel spent lifetimes proclaiming God’s Word. Only a comparatively small amount of what they preached is recorded in the Bible as God’s direct revelation. They must have continually repeated and reemphasized those truths, as preachers today repeat, explain, and reemphasize the Word of God in Scripture. The best definition for this gift is given in 14:3 . The importance of this gift is given in 14:1 , 39 . Its supremacy to other gifts, especially tongues, is the theme of chap. 14 . See notes on 1Th 5:20 ; Rev 19:10 . distinguishing of spirits. Satan is the great deceiver ( Jn 8:44 ), and his demons counterfeit God’s message and work. Christians with the gift of discernment have the God-given ability to recognize lying spirits and to identify deceptive and erroneous doctrine (cf. Ac 17:11 ; 1Jn 4:1 ). Paul illustrated the use of this gift in Ac 16:16–18 , as Peter had exercised it in Ac 5:3 . When it was not being exercised in the Corinthian church, grave distortion of the truth occurred (see v. 3 ; 14:29 ). Though its operation has changed since apostolic times, because of the completion of Scripture, it is still essential to have people in the church who are discerning. They are the guardians, the watchmen who protect the church from demonic lies, false doctrines, perverted cults, and fleshly elements. As it requires diligent study of the Word to exercise gifts of knowledge, wisdom, preaching, and teaching, so it does with discernment. See notes on 1Th 5:20–22 . tongues … translation. These temporary sign gifts, using the normal words for speaking a foreign language and translating it, like the others (miracles, healings) were for the authentication of the truth and those who preached it. This true gift was clearly identified in Ac 2:5–12 as languages, which validated the gospel as divine. They were, however, because of their counterfeit in the culture, disproportionately exalted and seriously abused in Corinth. Here, Paul identified them, but throughout chap. 14 he discussed them in detail. See notes on 14:1–39 ."

That outward sign depicts the believer’s union with Christ in His death and resurrection ( see notes on Ro 6:3–4 ). Similarly, all believers are also immersed into the body of Christ by means of the Holy Spirit. Paul’s point is to emphasize the unity of believers. There cannot be any believer who has not been Spirit-baptized, nor can there be more than one Spirit baptism, or the whole point of unity in the body of Christ is convoluted. Believers have all been Spirit-baptized and thus are all in one body. See notes on Eph 4:4–6 . This is not an experience to seek, but a reality to acknowledge.

There is no need (or divine provision) for any such thing as a second blessing, a triumphalistic experience of a deeper life, or a formula for instantly increased spirituality (cf. Jn 3:34 ).

There may be a distinction made on how prophecy and knowledge come to an end, and how the gift of tongues does. This is indicated by the Greek verb forms used. In the case of prophecy and knowledge, they are both said to “be done away” (in both cases the verb indicates that something will put an end to those two functions). Verses 9–10 indicate that what will abolish knowledge and prophecy is that which is “perfect.” When that occurs, those gifts will be rendered inoperative. The “perfect” is not the completion of Scripture, since there is still the operation of those two gifts and will be in the future kingdom (cf. Joel 2:28 ; Ac 2:17 ; Rev 11:3 ).

As a congregation, the Corinthians should be wanting the full expression of all the gifts to be exercised. “You” is plural, emphasizing the corporate desire of the church. especially … prophesy. This spiritual gift was desirable in the life of the church to serve in a way that tongues cannot, namely, by edifying the entire church (v. 5 )."

Paul seems to use the singular to distinguish the counterfeit gift of pagan gibberish and the plural to indicate the genuine gift of a foreign language ( see note on v. 2 ). It was perhaps in recognition of that, that the King James Version (KJV) translators added consistently the word “unknown” before every singular form (see vv. 2 , 4 , 13–14 , 19 , 27 ). The implications of that distinction will be noted as appropriate. Against the backdrop of carnality and counterfeit ecstatic speech learned from the experience of the pagans, Paul covers 3 basic issues with regard to speaking in languages by the gift of the Holy Spirit: 1) its position, inferior to prophecy (vv. 1–19 ); 2) its purpose, a sign to unbelievers not believers (vv. 20–25 ); and 3) its procedure, systematic, limited, and orderly (vv. 26–40 )."

That sign was 3-fold: cursing, blessing, and authority. To emphasize the cursing, Paul quoted Isaiah’s words of warning to Judah of the judgment from Assyria ( see note on Is 28:11–12 ). The leaders thought his words were too simple and rejected him. The time would come, the prophet said, when they would hear Assyrian, a language they could not understand, indicating judgment. Jeremiah spoke similarly of the Babylonians who were also to come and destroy Judah (cf. Jer 5:15 ). When the apostles spoke at Pentecost in all those foreign languages ( Ac 2:3–12 ), the Jews should have known that the judgment prophesied and historically fulfilled first by the Assyrians and then by the Babylonian captivity was about to fall on them again for their rejection of Christ, including the destruction of Jerusalem (AD 70) as it had happened in 586 BC under Babylonian power."

And once the sign served its purpose to pronounce judgment or cursing on Israel, and the judgment fell, the purpose ceased along with the sign gift. The blessing of that sign was that God would build a new nation of Jews and Gentiles to be His people ( Ga 3:28 ), to make Israel jealous and someday repent (see Ro 11:11–12 , 25–27 ). The sign was thus repeated when Gentiles were included in the church ( Ac 10:44–46 ).
