<com id="com01001001"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:1-2:3">1:1—2:3</xbr></bcv> This description of God creating heaven and earth is understood to be: 1) recent, i.e., thousands not millions of years ago; 2) <i>ex nihilo</i>, i.e., out of nothing; and 3) special, i.e., in 6 consecutive 24-hour periods called “days” and further distinguished as such by this phrase, “the evening and the morning.” Scripture does not support a creation date earlier than about 10,000 years ago. <b type="b_blue">In the beginning.</b> While God exists eternally (<xbr t="Ps 90:2">Ps 90:2</xbr>), this marked the beginning of the universe in time and space. In explaining Israel’s identity and purpose to her on the plains of Moab, God wanted His people to know about the origin of the world in which they found themselves. <b type="b_blue">God.</b> Elohim is a general term for deity and a name for the True God, though used also at times for pagan gods (<xbr t="Ge 31:30">31:30</xbr>), angels (<xbr t="Ps 8:5">Ps 8:5</xbr>), men (<xbr t="Ps 82:6">Ps 82:6</xbr>), and judges (<xbr t="Ex 21:6">Ex 21:6</xbr>). Moses made no attempt to defend the existence of God, which is assumed, or explain what He was like in person and works, which is treated elsewhere (cf. <xbr t="Is 43:10">Is 43:10</xbr>, <xbr t="Is 43:13">13</xbr>). Both are to be believed by faith (cf. <xbr t="Heb 11:3">Heb 11:3</xbr>, <xbr t="Heb 11:6">6</xbr>). <b type="b_blue">created.</b> This word is used here of God’s creative activity alone, although it occasionally is used elsewhere of matter which already existed (<xbr t="Is 65:18">Is 65:18</xbr>). Context demands in no uncertain terms that this was a creation without preexisting material (as does other Scripture: cf. <xbr t="Is 40:28">Is 40:28</xbr>; <xbr t="Is 45:8">45:8</xbr>, <xbr t="Is 45:12">12</xbr>, <xbr t="Is 45:18">18</xbr>; <xbr t="Is 48:13">48:13</xbr>; <xbr t="Je 10:16">Jer 10:16</xbr>; <xbr t="Ac 17:24">Ac 17:24</xbr>). <b type="b_blue">the heavens and the earth.</b> All of God’s creation is incorporated into this summary statement which includes all 6 consecutive days of creation.</com>
<com id="com01001002"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:2">1:2</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">formless and void.</b> This means “not finished in its shape and as yet uninhabited by creatures” (cf. <xbr t="Is 45:18-19">Is 45:18–19</xbr>; <xbr t="Je 4:23">Jer 4:23</xbr>). God would quickly (in 6 days) decorate His initial creation (<xbr t="Ge 1:2-2:3">1:2—2:3</xbr>). <b type="b_blue">deep.</b> Sometimes referred to as primordial waters, this is the term used to describe the earth’s water-covered surface before the dry land emerged (<xbr t="Ge 1:9-10">1:9–10</xbr>). Jonah used this word to describe the watery abyss in which he found himself submerged (<xbr t="Jon 2:5">Jon 2:5</xbr>). <b type="b_blue">Spirit of God.</b> Not only did God the Holy Spirit participate in creation, but so did God the Son (cf. <xbr t="Jn 1:1-3">Jn 1:1–3</xbr>; <xbr t="Col 1:16">Col 1:16</xbr>; <xbr t="Heb 1:2">Heb 1:2</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01001003"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:3">1:3</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">God said.</b> God effortlessly spoke light into existence (cf. <xbr t="Ps 33:6">Pss 33:6</xbr>; <xbr t="Ps 148:5">148:5</xbr>). This dispelled the darkness of v. <xbr t="Ge 1:2">2</xbr>. <b type="b_blue">light.</b> The greater and lesser lights (the sun and moon) were created later (<xbr t="Ge 1:14-19">1:14–19</xbr>) on the fourth day. Here, God was the provider of light (<xbr t="2Co 4:6">2Co 4:6</xbr>) and will in eternity future be the source of light (cf. <xbr t="Rev 21:23">Rev 21:23</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01001004"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:4">1:4</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">good.</b> Good for the purposes it was intended to serve (cf. <xbr t="Ge 1:31">1:31</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01001004a"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:4-5">1:4–5</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">separated … called.</b> After the initial creation, God continued to complete His universe. Once God separated certain things, He then named them. Separating and naming were acts of dominion and served as a pattern for man, who would also name a portion of God’s creation over which God gave him dominion (<xbr t="Ge 2:19-20">2:19–20</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01001005"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:5">1:5</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">one day.</b> God established the pattern of creation in 7 days which constituted a complete week. “Day” can refer to: 1) the light portion of a 24-hour period (<xbr t="Ge 1:5">1:5</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 1:14">14</xbr>); 2) an extended period of time (<xbr t="Ge 2:4">2:4</xbr>); or 3) the 24-hour period which basically refers to a full rotation of the earth on its axis, called evening and morning. This cannot mean an age, but only a day, reckoned by the Jews from sunset to sunset (vv. <xbr t="Ge 1:8">8</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 1:13">13</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 1:19">19</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 1:23">23</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 1:31">31</xbr>). “Day” with numerical adjectives in Hebrew always refers to a 24-hour period. Comparing the order of the week in <xbr t="Ex 20:8-11">Ex 20:8–11</xbr> with the creation week confirms this understanding of the time element. Such a cycle of light and dark means that the earth was rotating on its axis, so that there was a source of light on one side of the earth, though the sun was not yet created (v. <xbr t="Ge 1:16">16</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01001006"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:6">1:6</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">expanse.</b> The portion of God’s creation named “heavens,” that which man saw when he looked up, i.e., the atmospheric and stellar heaven.</com>
<com id="com01001007"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:7">1:7</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">below the expanse.</b> Refers to subterranean reservoirs (cf. <xbr t="Ge 7:11">7:11</xbr>). <b type="b_blue">above the expanse.</b> This could possibly have been a canopy of water vapor which acted to make the earth like a hothouse, provided uniform temperature, inhibited mass air movements, caused mist to fall, and filtered out ultraviolet rays, thus extending life.</com>
<com id="com01001009"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:9-10">1:9–10</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">dry land.</b> This was caused by a tremendous, cataclysmic upheaval of the earth’s surface, and the rising and sinking of the land, which caused the waters to plunge into the low places, forming the seas, the continents and islands, the rivers and lakes (cf. <xbr t="Job 38:4-11">Job 38:4–11</xbr>; <xbr t="Ps 104:6-9">Ps 104:6–9</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01001011"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:11-12">1:11–12</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">after their kind.</b> God set in motion a providential process whereby the vegetable kingdom could reproduce through seeds which would maintain each one’s unique characteristics. The same phrase is used to describe the perpetuating reproduction of animals within their created species (vv. <xbr t="Ge 1:21">21</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 1:24-25">24–25</xbr>), and indicates that evolution, which proposes reproduction across species lines, is a false explanation of origins.</com>
<com id="com01001011a"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:11">1:11</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">with seed in them.</b> The principle of reproduction that marks all life (cf. vv. <xbr t="Ge 1:22">22</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 1:24">24</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 1:28">28</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01001014"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:14">1:14</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">lights.</b> Cf. v. <xbr t="Ge 1:16">16</xbr>. For 3 days there had been light (v. <xbr t="Ge 1:4">4</xbr>) in the day as though there were a sun, and lesser light at night as though there were the moon and stars. God could have left it that way, but did not. He created the “lights, sun, moon, and stars,” not for light, but to serve as markers for signs, seasons, days, and years. <b type="b_blue">signs.</b> Certainly to include: 1) weather (<xbr t="Mt 16:2-3">Mt 16:2–3</xbr>); 2) testimony to God (<xbr t="Ps 8">Pss 8</xbr>, <xbr t="Ps 19">19</xbr>; <xbr t="Ro 1:14-20">Ro 1:14–20</xbr>); 3) divine judgment (<xbr t="Joe 2:30-31">Joel 2:30–31</xbr>; <xbr t="Mt 24:29">Mt 24:29</xbr>); and 4) navigation (<xbr t="Mt 2:1-2">Mt 2:1–2</xbr>). <b type="b_blue">seasons.</b> It is the earth’s movement in relation to the sun and moon that determines the seasons and the calendar.</com>
<com id="com01001015"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:15-18">1:15–18</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">two great lights … to separate the light from the darkness.</b> It was God (not some other deity) who created the lights. Israel had originally come from Mesopotamia, where the celestial bodies were worshiped, and more recently from Egypt, where the sun was worshiped as a primary deity. God was revealing to them that the very stars, moons, and planets which Israel’s neighbors had worshiped were the products of His creation. Later, they became worshipers of the “host of heaven” (<i>see note on <xbr t="2Ki 17:16">2Ki 17:16</xbr></i>), which led to their being taken captive out of the Promised Land.</com>
<com id="com01001020"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:20">1:20</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">living creatures.</b> These creatures, including the extraordinarily large ones, included all sorts of fish and mammals, even dinosaurs (<i>see notes on <xbr t="Job 40:15-41:1">Job 40:15—41:1</xbr></i>).</com>
<com id="com01001022"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:22">1:22</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">blessed.</b> This is the first occurrence of the word “bless” in Scripture. God’s admonition to “be fruitful and multiply” was the substance of the blessing.</com>
<com id="com01001024"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:24-25">1:24–25</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">cattle … beasts.</b> This probably represents all kinds of large, four-legged animals.</com>
<com id="com01001024a"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:24">1:24</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">beasts of the earth.</b> Different from and larger than the clan of cattle, this would include dinosaurs like Behemoth (<xbr t="Job 40:15">Job 40:15ff.</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01001026"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:26">1:26</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Us … Our.</b> The first clear indication of the triunity of God (cf. <xbr t="Ge 3:22">3:22</xbr>; <xbr t="Ge 11:7">11:7</xbr>). The very name of God, Elohim (<xbr t="Ge 1:1">1:1</xbr>), is a plural form of El. <b type="b_blue">man.</b> The crowning point of creation, a living human, was made in God’s image to rule creation. <b type="b_blue">Our image.</b> This defined man’s unique relation to God. Man is a living being capable of embodying God’s communicable attributes (cf. <xbr t="Ge 9:6">9:6</xbr>; <xbr t="Ro 8:29">Ro 8:29</xbr>; <xbr t="Col 3:10">Col 3:10</xbr>; <xbr t="Jam 3:9">Jas 3:9</xbr>). In his rational life, he was like God in that he could reason and had intellect, will, and emotion. In the moral sense, he was like God because he was good and sinless.</com>
<com id="com01001026a"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:26-28">1:26–28</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">have dominion over.</b> This defined man’s unique relation to creation. Man was God’s representative in ruling over the creation. The command to rule separated him from the rest of living creation and defined his relationship as above the rest of creation (cf. <xbr t="Ps 8:6-8">Ps 8:6–8</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01001027"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:27">1:27</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">male and female.</b> Cf. <xbr t="Mt 19:4">Mt 19:4</xbr>; <xbr t="Mk 10:6">Mk 10:6</xbr>. While these two persons equally shared God’s image and together exercised dominion over creation, they were by divine design physically diverse in order to accomplish God’s mandate to multiply, i.e., neither one could reproduce offspring without the other.</com>
<com id="com01001028"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:28">1:28</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">blessed.</b> This second blessing (cf. <xbr t="Ge 1:22">1:22</xbr>) involved reproduction and dominion. <b type="b_blue">Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it.</b> God, having just created the universe, created His representative (rule over) and representation (cf. image and likeness). Man would fill the earth and oversee its operation. “Subdue” does not suggest a wild and unruly condition for the creation because God Himself pronounced it “good.” Rather, it speaks of a productive ordering of the earth and its inhabitants to yield its riches and accomplish God’s purposes.</com>
<com id="com01001029"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:29-30">1:29–30</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">food for you … for food.</b> Prior to the curse (<xbr t="Ge 3:14-19">3:14–19</xbr>), both mankind and beasts were vegetarians.</com>
<com id="com01001031"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 1:31">1:31</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">very good.</b> What had been pronounced good individually (vv. <xbr t="Ge 1:4">4</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 1:10">10</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 1:12">12</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 1:18">18</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 1:21">21</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 1:25">25</xbr>) was now called “very good” collectively. The words anticipated God’s conclusion that it was “not good” for a man to be alone (<xbr t="Ge 2:18">2:18</xbr>), which occurred on the sixth day.</com>
<com id="com01002001"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:1-3">2:1–3</xbr></bcv> These words affirm that God had completed His work. Four times it is said that He finished His work, and 3 times it is said that this included all His work. Present processes in the universe reflect God sustaining that completed creation, not more creation (cf. <xbr t="Heb 1:3">Heb 1:3</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01002002"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:2">2:2</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">completed … rested.</b> God certainly did not rest due to weariness; rather, establishing the pattern for man’s work cycle, He only modeled the need for rest. Later, the Sabbath ordinance of Moses found its basis in the creation week (cf. <xbr t="Ex 20:8-11">Ex 20:8–11</xbr>). The Sabbath was God’s sacred ordained day in the weekly cycle. Jesus said, “The Sabbath was made for man” (<xbr t="Mk 2:27">Mk 2:27</xbr>), and <xbr t="Ge 2:3">Ge 2:3</xbr> stated that God “sanctified” or set apart the Sabbath day because He rested in it. Later, it was set aside for a day of worship in the Mosaic law (<i>see note on <xbr t="Ex 20:8">Ex 20:8</xbr></i>). <xbr t="Heb 4:4">Hebrews 4:4</xbr> distinguishes between physical rest and the redemptive rest to which it pointed. <xbr t="Col 2:16">Colossians 2:16</xbr> makes it clear that the Mosaic “Sabbath” has no symbolic or ritual place in the New Covenant. The church began worshiping on the first day of the week to commemorate the resurrection of Christ (<xbr t="Ac 20:7">Ac 20:7</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01002004"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:4-4:26">2:4—4:26</xbr></bcv> The history of the heavens and the earth (v. <xbr t="Ge 2:4">4</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01002004a"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:4-25">2:4–25</xbr></bcv> This section fills in the details of man’s creation on day six. How did Moses obtain this account, so different from the absurd fictions of the pagans? Not from any human source, for man was not in existence to witness it. Not from the light of reason, for though intellect can know the eternal power of the Godhead (<xbr t="Ro 1:18-20">Ro 1:18–20</xbr>) and that God made all things, it cannot know how. None but the Creator Himself could give this data and, therefore, it is through faith that one understands that the worlds were formed by the Word of God (<xbr t="Heb 11:3">Heb 11:3</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01002006"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:6">2:6</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">stream … rise from the earth.</b> “Stream” should be translated “flow.” It indicates that water came up from beneath the ground as springs and spread over the whole earth in an uninterrupted cycle of water. After the fall, rain became the primary means of watering the earth and allowed for floods and droughts that did not exist originally. Rains also allowed for God to judge through floods and droughts.</com>
<com id="com01002007"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:7">2:7</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">formed.</b> Many of the words used in this account of the creation of man picture a master craftsman at work shaping a work of art to which he gives life (<xbr t="1Co 15:45">1Co 15:45</xbr>). This adds detail to the statement of fact in <xbr t="Ge 1:27">1:27</xbr> (cf. <xbr t="1Ti 2:13">1Ti 2:13</xbr>). Cf. <xbr t="Ps 139:14">Ps 139:14</xbr>. Made from dirt, a man’s value is not in the physical components that form his body, but in the quality of life which forms his soul (see <xbr t="Job 33:4">Job 33:4</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01002008"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:8">2:8</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">garden … Eden.</b> The Babylonians called the lush green land from which water flowed <i>edenu;</i> today, the term “oasis” describes such a place. This was a magnificent garden paradise, unlike any the world has seen since, where God fellowshiped with those He created in His image. The exact location of Eden is unknown; if “toward the east” was used in relationship to where Moses was when he wrote, then it could have been in the area of Babylon, the Mesopotamian Valley.</com>
<com id="com01002009"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:9">2:9</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">tree of life.</b> A real tree, with special properties to sustain eternal life. It was placed in the center of the garden, where it must have been observed by Adam, and its fruit perhaps eaten by him, thus sustaining his life (<xbr t="Ge 2:16">2:16</xbr>). Such a tree, symbolic of eternal life, will be in the new heavens and new earth (<i>see note on <xbr t="Rev 22:2">Rev 22:2</xbr></i>). <b type="b_blue">tree … knowledge.</b> Cf. <xbr t="Ge 2:16">2:16</xbr>; <xbr t="Ge 3:1-6">3:1–6</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 3:11">11</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 3:22">22</xbr>. It was perhaps given that title because it was a test of obedience by which our first parents were tried, whether they would be good or bad—obey God or disobey His command.</com>
<com id="com01002010"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:10">2:10</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">out of.</b> That is to say “the source,” and likely refers to some great spring gushing up inside the garden from some subterranean reservoir. There was no rain at that time.</com>
<com id="com01002011"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:11">2:11</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Pishon … Havilah.</b> Locations are uncertain. This represents pre-Flood geography, now dramatically altered.</com>
<com id="com01002012"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:12">2:12</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">bdellium.</b> A gum resin. This refers more to appearance than color, i.e., it had the appearance of a pale resin.</com>
<com id="com01002013"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:13">2:13</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Gihon … Cush.</b> The river location is uncertain. Cush could be modern-day Ethiopia.</com>
<com id="com01002014"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:14">2:14</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Tigris … Asshur.</b> The post-Flood Tigris River runs northwest to southeast east of the city of Babylon through the Mesopotamian Valley. <b type="b_blue">Euphrates.</b> A river that runs parallel (northwest to southeast) to the Tigris and empties into the Persian Gulf after joining the Tigris.</com>
<com id="com01002015"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:15">2:15</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">cultivate it and keep it.</b> Work was an important and dignified part of representing the image of God and serving Him, even before the Fall. Cf. <xbr t="Rev 22:3">Rev 22:3</xbr>.</com>
<com id="com01002017"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:17">2:17</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">surely die.</b> To “die” has the basic idea of separation. It can mean spiritual separation, physical separation, and/or eternal separation. At the moment of their sin, Adam and Eve died spiritually, but because God was merciful they did not die physically until later (<xbr t="Ge 5:5">5:5</xbr>). There is no reason given for this prohibition, other than it was a test (<i>see note on v. <xbr t="Ge 2:9">9</xbr></i>). There was nothing magical about that tree, but eating from it after it had been forbidden by God would indeed give man the knowledge of evil—since evil can be defined as disobeying God. Man already had the knowledge of good.</com>
<com id="com01002018"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:18">2:18</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">not good.</b> When God saw His creation as very good (<xbr t="Ge 1:31">1:31</xbr>), He viewed it as being to that point the perfect outcome to His creative plan. However, in observing man’s state as not good, He was commenting on his incompleteness before the end of the sixth day because the woman, Adam’s counterpart, had not yet been created. The words of this verse emphasize man’s need for a companion, a helper, and an equal. He was incomplete without someone to complement him in fulfilling the task of filling, multiplying, and taking dominion over the earth. This points to Adam’s inadequacy, not Eve’s insufficiency (cf. <xbr t="1Co 11:9">1Co 11:9</xbr>). Woman was made by God to meet man’s deficiency (cf. <xbr t="1Ti 2:14">1Ti 2:14</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01002019"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:19">2:19</xbr></bcv> This was not a new creation of animals. They were created before man on the fifth and sixth days (<xbr t="Ge 1:20-25">1:20–25</xbr>). Here the Lord God was calling attention to the fact that He created them “out of the ground” as He did man, but man, who was a living soul in the image of God, was to name them, signifying his rule over them.</com>
<com id="com01002020"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:20">2:20</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">gave names to.</b> Naming is an act of discerning something about the creature so as to appropriately identify it and also an act of leadership or authority over that which was named. There is no kinship with any animal since none was a fitting companion for Adam.</com>
<com id="com01002021"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:21">2:21</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">one of his ribs.</b> This could also be “sides,” including surrounding flesh (“flesh of my flesh,” v. <xbr t="Ge 2:23">23</xbr>). Divine surgery by the Creator presented no problems. This would also imply the first act of healing in Scripture.</com>
<com id="com01002023"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:23">2:23</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">bone of my bones.</b> Adam’s poem focuses on naming the delight of his heart in this newly found companion. The man (ish) names her “woman” (isha) because she had her source in him (the root of the word “woman” is “soft”). She truly was made of bone from his bones and flesh from his flesh. Cf. <xbr t="1Co 11:8">1Co 11:8</xbr>. The English words man/woman sustain the same relationship as the Hebrew words, hinting at that original creation.</com>
<com id="com01002024"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 2:24">2:24</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">leave … cleave to.</b> The marital relationship was established as the first human institution. The responsibility to honor one’s parents (<xbr t="Ex 20:12">Ex 20:12</xbr>) does not cease with leaving and the union of husband with wife (<xbr t="Mt 19:5">Mt 19:5</xbr>; <xbr t="Mk 10:7-8">Mk 10:7–8</xbr>; <xbr t="1Co 6:16">1Co 6:16</xbr>; <xbr t="Eph 5:31">Eph 5:31</xbr>), but does represent the inauguration of a new and primary responsibility. “Cleave” carries the sense of a permanent or indissoluble union, so that divorce was not considered (cf. <xbr t="Ge 3:16">3:16</xbr>). “One flesh” speaks of a complete unity of parts making a whole, e.g., one cluster, many grapes (<xbr t="Nu 13:23">Nu 13:23</xbr>) or one God in 3 persons (<xbr t="De 6:4">Dt 6:4</xbr>); thus this marital union was complete and whole with two people. This also implies their sexual completeness. One man and one woman constitute the pair to reproduce. The “one flesh” is primarily seen in the child born of that union, the one perfect result of the union of two. Cf. uses of this verse in <xbr t="Mt 19:5-6">Mt 19:5–6</xbr>; <xbr t="Mk 10:8">Mk 10:8</xbr>; <xbr t="1Co 6:16">1Co 6:16</xbr>; <xbr t="Eph 5:31">Eph 5:31</xbr>.

<com id="com01003001"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 3:1">3:1</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">the serpent.</b> The word means “snake.” The apostle John identified this creature as Satan (cf. <xbr t="Rev 12:9">Rev 12:9</xbr>; <xbr t="Rev 20:2">20:2</xbr>) as did Paul (<xbr t="2Co 11:3">2Co 11:3</xbr>). The serpent, a manifestation of Satan, appears for the first time before the Fall of man. The rebellion of Satan, therefore, had occurred sometime after <xbr t="Ge 1:31">1:31</xbr> (when everything in creation was good), but before <xbr t="Ge 3:1">3:1</xbr>.

Satan, being a fallen archangel and, thus, a supernatural spirit, had possessed the body of a snake in its pre-Fall form (cf. <xbr t="Ge 3:14">3:14</xbr> for post-Fall form). <b type="b_blue">more crafty.</b> Deceitful; cf. <xbr t="Mt 10:16">Mt 10:16</xbr>. <b type="b_blue">to the woman.</b> She was the object of his attack, being the weaker one and needing the protection of her husband.

Though sinless, she was temptable and seducible. <b type="b_blue">has God said…?</b> In effect Satan said, “Is it true that He has restricted you from the delights of this place?

There must be some mistake.” He insinuated doubt as to her understanding of God’s will, appearing as an angel of light (<xbr t="2Co 11:14">2Co 11:14</xbr>) to lead her to the supposed true interpretation.

In the midst of the curse passage, a message of hope shone forth—the woman’s offspring called “He” is Christ, who will one day defeat the Serpent. Satan could only “bruise” Christ’s heel (cause Him to suffer), while Christ will bruise Satan’s head (destroy him with a fatal blow). Paul, in a passage strongly reminiscent of <xbr t="Ge 3">Ge 3</xbr>, encouraged the believers in Rome, “And the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet” (<xbr t="Ro 16:20">Ro 16:20</xbr>).

Sin has turned the harmonious system of God-ordained roles into distasteful struggles of self-will. Lifelong companions, husbands and wives, will need God’s help in getting along as a result. The woman’s desire will be to lord it over her husband, but the husband will rule by divine design (<xbr t="Eph 5:22-25">Eph 5:22–25</xbr>).

This ended the water canopy surrounding the earth and unleashed the water in the earth; together these phenomena began the new system of hydrology that has since characterized the earth (see <xbr t="Job 26:8">Job 26:8</xbr>; <xbr t="Ec 1:7">Ecc 1:7</xbr>; <xbr t="Is 55:10">Is 55:10</xbr>; <xbr t="Am 9:6">Am 9:6</xbr>). The sequence in this verse, indicating that the earth’s crust breaks up first, then the heavens drop their water, is interesting because the volcanic explosions that would have occurred when the earth fractured would have sent magma and dust into the atmosphere, along with gigantic sprays of water, gas, and air—all penetrating the canopy and triggering its downpour.</com>

The term “everlasting” can mean either 1) to the end of time and/or 2) through eternity future. It never looks back to eternity past.

This notation is important since Moses was writing the Pentateuch just before the Israelites took Canaan (see <xref idref="intro01">Introduction: Author and Date, Background and Setting</xref>).</com>

<com id="com01009022"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 9:22">9:22</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">saw the nakedness.</b> There is no reasonable support for the notion that some perverse activity, in addition to seeing nakedness, occurred. But clearly, the implication is that Ham looked with some sinful thought, if only for a while until he left to inform his brothers. Perhaps he was glad to see his father’s dignity and authority reduced to such weakness. He thought his brothers might share his feelings so he eagerly told them. They did not, however, share his attitude (v. <xbr t="Ge 9:23">23</xbr>).</com>

These were the people with whom Israel had to do battle shortly after they first heard Moses’ reading of this passage. Here, God gave Israel the theological basis for the conquest of Canaan. The descendants of Ham had received a sentence of judgment for the sins of their progenitor. In <xbr t="Ge 10:15-20">10:15–20</xbr>, the descendants of Canaan are seen to be the earlier inhabitants of the land later promised to Abraham.</com>

These are not only the cursed people of Canaan’s curse for the scene at Noah’s drunkenness, but also they are those who possess the Promised Land which Israel as a nation needed to conquer.

The tower, even though it was a part of the plan, was not the singular act of rebellion. Human pride was, which led these people to defy God. They were refusing to move on, i.e., scattering to fill the earth as they had been instructed. In fact, this was Nimrod’s and the people’s effort to disobey the command of God in <xbr t="Ge 9:1">9:1</xbr>, and thus defeat the counsel of heaven.

Since Mesopotamia was not his home and his contract with Laban was up, he desired to return to “my own place” and “my own land.” Jacob’s wish to return to Canaan was not hidden from Laban (v. <xbr t="Ge 30:30">30</xbr>).</com>

<com id="com01030028"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 30:28">30:28</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Name me your wages.</b> On the two occasions that Laban asked this of Jacob it was to urge him to stay. The first time (<xbr t="Ge 29:15">29:15</xbr>) Laban had sought to reward a relative, but this time it was because he had been rewarded since “Yahweh has blessed me on your account” (v. <xbr t="Ge 30:27">27</xbr>). Jacob readily confirmed Laban’s evaluation in that “little” had indeed become “a multitude” (v. <xbr t="Ge 30:30">30</xbr>) since he had come on the scene. Laban’s superficial generosity should not be mistaken for genuine goodness (see <xbr t="Ge 31:7">31:7</xbr>). He was attempting to deceive Jacob into staying because it was potentially profitable for him.</com>
<com id="com01030031"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 30:31-36">30:31–36</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">What shall I give you?</b> Laban wanted Jacob to stay and asked what it would take for him to do so. Jacob wanted nothing except to be in a position for God to bless him. He was willing to stay, but not be further indebted to the scheming and selfish Laban. He offered Laban a plan that could bless him while costing Laban nothing. He would continue to care for Laban’s animals, as he had been doing. His pay would consist of animals not yet born, animals which would seem the less desirable to Laban because of their markings and color. None of the solid color animals would be taken by Jacob, and if any were born into Jacob’s flocks, Laban could take them (they were considered as stolen). Only those animals born speckled, spotted, striped, or abnormally colored would belong to Jacob. Evidently, most of the animals were white (sheep), black (goats), and brown (cattle). Few were in the category of Jacob’s request. Further, Jacob would not even use the living speckled or abnormally colored animals to breed more like them. He would separate them into a flock of their own kind, apart from the normally colored animals. Only the spotted and abnormally colored offspring born in the future to the normally colored would be his. Since it seemed to Laban that the birth of such abnormally marked animals was unlikely to occur in any significant volume from the normally colored, he agreed. He believed this a small and favorable concession on his part to maintain the skills of Jacob to further enlarge his herds and flocks. Jacob, by this, put himself entirely in God’s hands. Only Yahweh could determine what animals would be Jacob’s. To make sure Jacob didn’t cheat on his good deal, Laban separated the abnormally marked from the normal animals in Jacob’s care (vv. <xbr t="Ge 30:34-36">34–36</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01030037"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 30:37-42">30:37–42</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">rods.</b> Jacob was knowledgeable about sheep, goats, and cattle, having kept his father’s animals for most of his 90 years, and Laban’s for the last 14 years. He knew that when one uncommonly marked animal was born (with a recessive gene), he could then begin to breed that gene selectively to produce flocks and herds of abnormally marked animals, which were in no way inferior physically to the normally marked. Once he began this breeding process, he sought to stimulate it by some methods that may appear superstitious and foolish to us (as the mandrakes in v. <xbr t="Ge 30:14">14</xbr>). But it is most likely that he had learned that, when the bark was peeled, there was some stimulant released into the water that stimulated the animals to sexual activity. In v. <xbr t="Ge 30:38">38</xbr>, the word “mated” is literally, in Hebrew, “to be hot,” or as is said of animals, “to be in heat.” His plan was successful (v. <xbr t="Ge 30:39">39</xbr>), and he kept his own flock separate from the normally colored ones of Laban. His system worked to his own advantage, not that of Laban (v. <xbr t="Ge 30:42">42</xbr>) who had for years taken advantage of him. Jacob gave God the credit for the success of his efforts (<xbr t="Ge 31:7">31:7</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 31:9">9</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com01031001"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 31:1-2">31:1–2</xbr></bcv> Of materialistic bent and envious at Jacob’s success, Laban’s sons grumbled at what they saw as the depleting of their father’s assets, thus hurting their own inheritance. If Jacob heard of this, so did Laban, and that knowledge rankled him to the point of surliness toward his son-in-law (cf. <xbr t="Ge 31:20">31:20</xbr>). Profiting from God’s blessings through Jacob (<xbr t="Ge 30:27">30:27</xbr>, <xbr t="Ge 30:30">30</xbr>) was one thing, but seeing only Jacob blessed was quite another matter and elicited no praise or gratitude to God from Laban.</com>

Six years later, God providentially directed Jacob’s departure and assured him of His presence. Jacob served his father-in-law a total of twelve years (vv. <xbr t="Ge 31:38-41">38–41</xbr>).</com>

Such a parenthesis in the Joseph story demands some reason why a chapter laced with wickedness, immorality, and subterfuge should of necessity be placed in this spot. The answer is that the events recorded are chronologically in the right place, being contemporary with the time of Joseph’s slavery in Egypt (v. <xbr t="Ge 38:1">1</xbr>, “at that time”). The account is also genealogically in the right place, i.e., with Joseph gone (seemingly for good), with Reuben, Simeon, and Levi out of favor (for incest and for treachery), Judah would most likely accede to firstborn status. It provides a contrast because it also demonstrates the immoral character of Judah, as compared with the virtue of Joseph. Canaanite syncretistic religion and inclusivism threatened to absorb the fourth and later generations of Abraham’s heirs, but Egyptian exile and racial exclusivism produced not loss of their ethnic identity, but preservation of it.</com>

Whatever may have been the land tenure system at that time, some private land ownership did at first exist, but finally, as in a feudal system, all worked their land for Pharaoh. Landed nobility did lose out and declined during major social reforms undertaken under Senusert III. This is the first record in Scripture of a national income tax, and the amount was 20 percent.

Verses <xbr t="Ge 49:23-24">23–24</xbr> may be a biography of Joseph. No other tribe had such direct reference to the Lord God (vv. <xbr t="Ge 49:24-25">24–25</xbr>) in their blessing as addressed to Joseph. The 4 names for God well reflect Joseph’s emphasis on the sovereignty of his God, no matter the misfortune and grief which attended his way (cf. v. <xbr t="Ge 49:23">23</xbr>). Samuel was from Ephraim, Gideon from Manasseh.</com>
<com id="com01049027"><bcv><xbr t="Ge 49:27">49:27</xbr></bcv> The warlike nature of the small tribe of Benjamin became well known, as exhibited in their archers and slingers (<xbr t="Jdg 20:16">Jdg 20:16</xbr>; <xbr t="1Ch 8:40">1Chr 8:40</xbr>; <xbr t="1Ch 12:2">12:2</xbr>; <xbr t="2Ch 14:8">2Chr 14:8</xbr>; <xbr t="2Ch 17:17">17:17</xbr>) and in their brazen defense of their wickedness in Gibeah (<xbr t="Jdg 19-20">Jdg 19–20</xbr>). Both Sauls in the Bible were from this tribe: the first king in Israel (<xbr t="1Sa 9:1-2">1Sa 9:1–2</xbr>) and the Apostle Paul (<xbr t="Php 3:5">Php 3:5</xbr>).</com>
