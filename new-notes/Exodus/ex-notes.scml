<com id="com02001001"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:1-12:36">1:1—12:36</xbr></bcv> This section recounts Israel’s final years in Egypt before the Exodus.</com>
<com id="com02001001a"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:1-5">1:1–5</xbr></bcv> Genesis also reported the names and the number of Jacob’s descendants who came to Egypt (<xbr t="Ge 35:23-26">Ge 35:23–26</xbr>; <xbr t="Ge 46:8-27">46:8–27</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02001005"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:5">1:5</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">seventy in number.</b> Cf. <xbr t="Ge 46:8-27">Ge 46:8–27</xbr>. <xbr t="Ac 7:14">Ac 7:14</xbr> reports 75 with the addition of 5 relatives of Joseph included in the LXX, but not the Hebrew text.</com>
<com id="com02001006"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:6-8">1:6–8</xbr></bcv> This summary of a lengthy period of time moves the record from the death of Joseph (ca. 1804 BC), the last recorded event in Genesis, to the radical change in Israel’s history, i.e., from favor before Egypt’s pharaoh to disfavor and enslavement (ca. 1525–1445 BC).</com>
<com id="com02001007"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:7">1:7</xbr></bcv> The growth of the nation (cf. <xbr t="Ex 12:37">12:37</xbr>) was phenomenal! It grew from 70 men to 603,000 males, 20 years of age and older, thus allowing for a total population of about 2 million (<xbr t="Nu 1:46">Nu 1:46</xbr>) departing from Egypt. The seed of Abraham was no longer an extended family, but a nation. The promise that his descendants would be fruitful and multiply (<xbr t="Ge 35:11-12">Ge 35:11–12</xbr>) had indeed been fulfilled in Egypt.</com>
<com id="com02001008"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:8">1:8</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">a new king arose.</b> This king is either to be identified as one of the Hyksos kings (see <xref idref="intro02">Introduction</xref>) during a period of political disintegration, or as Pharaoh Ahmose I, founder of what archeologists have designated as the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom period in Egyptian history. It is probably best to take this new king, who did not know Joseph, as a Hyksos ruler. Furthermore, the term “arose” signifies “rose against,” which accords well with a foreign seizure of the Egyptian throne. The Hyksos (ca. 1730–1570 BC) came from outside Egypt (cf. <xbr t="Ac 7:18">Ac 7:18</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02001009"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:9-12">1:9–12</xbr></bcv> Another summary of a fairly lengthy period of time, as indicated by the population continuing to grow in spite of increasing hardship imposed on Israel.</com>
<com id="com02001009a"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:9">1:9</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">the people.</b> An Egyptian pharaoh designated Israel as a nation, marking the first time the term “people” or “nation” is used of them.</com>
<com id="com02001010"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:10-11">1:10–11</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">join … those who hate us … appointed taskmasters over them.</b> Israel was assessed both as a threat to national security and as an economic asset—slavery would, therefore, control the danger and maximize their usefulness.</com>
<com id="com02001011"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:11">1:11</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">storage cities, Pithom and Raamses.</b> Places where both provisions and military hardware were stored. Archeological identification has not been finally definitive, with some 3 to 5 options being put forward for them. Pithom is usually taken as a center of solar worship in northern Egypt, and Raamses as Qantir in the eastern Delta region. In addition, the city might very well have been renamed under the reign of the later, powerful pharaoh, and that name was better known to Israel later on (cf. the case of Laish, or Leshem, renamed Dan in <xbr t="Ge 14:14">Ge 14:14</xbr>, <xbr t="Jos 19:47">Jos 19:47</xbr>, and <xbr t="Jdg 18:29">Jdg 18:29</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02001013"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:13">1:13</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">the Egyptians.</b> The native inhabitants continued to enslave Israel. Between vv. <xbr t="Ex 1:12">12</xbr> and <xbr t="Ex 1:13">13</xbr> a major change in Egyptian history took place—the Hyksos were driven out (ca. 1570 BC).</com>
<com id="com02001014"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:14">1:14</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">hard slave labor in mortar and bricks.</b> Archeologists have uncovered reliefs and paintings confirming the Egyptian practice of imposing forced labor on prisoners and slaves. These paintings also show foremen and guards watching construction work while scribes registered data on tablets.</com>
<com id="com02001015"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:15-17">1:15–17</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">the midwives feared God.</b> These brave, older women reverenced their God and thus obeyed Him and not man. They obviously understood that children were a gift from God and that murder was wrong. The two midwives mentioned by name were probably the leading representatives of their profession, for it is unlikely that such a burgeoning population had only two midwives to deal with all the births.</com>
<com id="com02001015a"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:15-16">1:15–16</xbr></bcv> The failure of rigorous bondage to suppress population growth necessitated that different measures be taken; hence, the royal order to the Hebrew midwives to murder male infants at birth.</com>
<com id="com02001016"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:16">1:16</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">birthstool.</b> Lit. “two stones” on which the women sat to deliver.</com>
<com id="com02001019"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:19-20">1:19–20</xbr></bcv> Rather than trying to argue for a justifiable lie on the part of midwives seeking to protect God’s people, take it as a statement of what was true: God was directly involved in this affair of birth and national growth. That’s the key to understanding why no decree of Pharaoh would work out as he intended it, and why Hebrew women were so healthy and gave birth with ease.</com>
<com id="com02001022"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 1:22">1:22</xbr></bcv> The failure of the extermination program demanded of the midwives finally caused Pharaoh to demand that all his subjects get involved in murdering newborn boys.</com>
<com id="com02002001"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 2:1-2">2:1–2</xbr></bcv> Since Moses was born soon after the general decree of <xbr t="Ex 1:22">1:22</xbr> was given (ca. 1525 BC), the issuer of the decree was Thutmose I.</com>
<com id="com02002003"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 2:3-4">2:3–4</xbr></bcv> The careful actions of Moses’ mother to construct the ark of bulrushes, to set Moses afloat close to the royal bathing place, and to have his sister watch to see what would happen, indicate a hope that something would work out right for the child.</com>
<com id="com02002005"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 2:5">2:5</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">the daughter of Pharaoh.</b> Identified possibly as Hatshepsut or another princess; in either case a princess whom God providentially used to override Pharaoh’s death decree and protect the life of His chosen leader for the Israelites.</com>
<com id="com02002010"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 2:10">2:10</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">became her son.</b> The position of “son” undoubtedly granted Moses special privileges belonging to nobility, but none of these persuaded Moses to relinquish his native origin. Rather, as the NT advises, his spiritual maturity was such that when he came of age, he “refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter” (<xbr t="Heb 11:24">Heb 11:24</xbr>). The formal education in the court of that time meant that Moses would have learned reading, writing, arithmetic, and perhaps one or more of the languages of Canaan. He would also have participated in various outdoor sports, e.g., archery and horseback riding, two favorites of the 18th Dynasty court.</com>
<com id="com02002011"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 2:11">2:11</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">that Moses had grown up.</b> The narrative skips over all details of Moses’ life as the adopted son of a princess prior to the event which led to his flight into Midian.</com>
<com id="com02002011a"><pnum id="pcom02002016"/><bcv><xbr t="Ex 2:11-12">2:11–12</xbr>, <xbr t="Ex 2:16-21">16–21</xbr></bcv> Two injustices aroused Moses’ indignation with different consequences: one resulted in his leaving home, having killed an Egyptian who beat an Israelite; the other resulted in his finding a new home as an Egyptian who helped the Midianite daughters of Reuel, and in his finding a wife. Undoubtedly, Reuel and his family soon discovered Moses was not really an Egyptian.</com>
<com id="com02002014"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 2:14">2:14</xbr></bcv> Cf. <xbr t="Ac 7:27-28">Ac 7:27–28</xbr>, <xbr t="Ac 7:35">35</xbr>.</com>
<com id="com02002015"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 2:15">2:15</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Midian.</b> The Midianites, who were descendants of Abraham and Keturah (<xbr t="Ge 25:1-4">Ge 25:1–4</xbr>), settled in the Arabian Peninsula along the eastern shore of the Gulf of Aqabah.</com>
<com id="com02002018"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 2:18">2:18</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Reuel.</b> He was also known as Jethro (<xbr t="Ex 3:1">3:1</xbr>), who may very well have been a worshiper of the true God (cf. <xbr t="Ex 18:12-23">18:12–23</xbr>), notwithstanding his being also the priest of Midian.</com>
<com id="com02002021"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 2:21-23">2:21–23</xbr></bcv> The narrative skips over the unimportant details of this 40-year period and moves the record quickly to the finding of a new home and family and to the moment when Moses returned to his people.</com>
<com id="com02002023"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 2:23-25">2:23–25</xbr></bcv> The hardship imposed upon Israel finally brought forth a collective cry for relief. The response of God is presented in 4 words: “heard,” “remembered,” “saw,” and “knew.” This signaled that a response was forthcoming.</com>
<com id="com02002024"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 2:24">2:24</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">remembered His covenant.</b> The unilateral covenant God made with Abraham (<xbr t="Ge 12:1-3">Ge 12:1–3</xbr>; <xbr t="Ge 15:1-21">15:1–21</xbr>; <xbr t="Ge 17:1-22">17:1–22</xbr>) and confirmed with Isaac (<xbr t="Ge 26:2-5">Ge 26:2–5</xbr>) and with Jacob (<xbr t="Ge 28:10-15">Ge 28:10–15</xbr>; <xbr t="Ge 35:9-15">35:9–15</xbr>) specifically promised a geographically recognizable territory to the descendants of Abraham through Isaac and Jacob. Through them, too, the world would be blessed.</com>
<com id="com02003001"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:1">3:1</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Moses was pasturing the flock.</b> Moses worked as a shepherd while living with his father-in-law, a life and occupation quite different from the privilege and prestige associated with his life in Pharaoh’s court. <b type="b_blue">Horeb.</b> An alternative name for Mt. Sinai (cf. <xbr t="Ex 19:11">19:11</xbr>; <xbr t="De 4:10">Dt 4:10</xbr>). Traditionally, this mountain has been identified with Jebel Musa, “the mountain of Moses.” “Horeb” is the Hebrew for the non-Semitic place-name, Sinai, located in the southern part of the Sinai Peninsula. <b type="b_blue">the mountain of God.</b> This is known as such because of what took place there later in Israel’s history. This name for the mountain suggests that the book of Exodus was written by Moses after the events at Sinai. Others suggest that it was already known as a sacred mountain prior to the call of Moses; but it seems best to relate the name to what God did for Israel there.</com>

<com id="com02003002"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:2-4">3:2–4</xbr></bcv> Moses’ attention was drawn to a most unusual sight, that of a burning bush which was not being consumed by the fire within. A supernatural event is the only viable explanation. Natural explanations of certain types of flowers with gaseous pods or oil glands fail, in that, after 40 years of work in the desert, Moses would surely have ignored something normal. This was so different that it aroused his curiosity and demanded further examination. God was in the bush speaking, clearly a miraculous event.</com>
<com id="com02003002a"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:2">3:2</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">the angel of Yahweh.</b> Lit. “messenger of Yahweh” who, in context, turns out to be Yahweh Himself talking to Moses (cf. <xbr t="Ac 7:30">Ac 7:30</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02003005"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:5-10">3:5–10</xbr></bcv> Cf. <xbr t="Ac 7:33-34">Ac 7:33–34</xbr>.</com>
<com id="com02003005a"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:5">3:5</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Do not come near. … Remove your sandals.</b> A sign of reverence in a holy place, one set apart from the norm because God was present there. These commands prevented Moses from rashly intruding, unprepared, into God’s presence.</com>
<com id="com02003006"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:6">3:6</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">I am the God of your father.</b> God’s opening words, although important for Moses to hear, point the reader back to <xbr t="Ex 2:24">2:24</xbr>—showing that the God of Israel has remembered His people and has begun to take action (cf. <xbr t="Mt 22:32">Mt 22:32</xbr>; <xbr t="Mk 12:26">Mk 12:26</xbr>; <xbr t="Lu 20:37">Lk 20:37</xbr>; <xbr t="Ac 3:13">Ac 3:13</xbr>; <xbr t="Ac 7:32">7:32</xbr>). <b type="b_blue">Moses hid his face.</b> A fitting reaction of reverent fear in the presence of the Divine was modeled by Moses.</com>
<com id="com02003007"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:7-8">3:7–8</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">I have surely seen … have heard.</b> An emphasis on God’s having been well aware of the desperate situation of Israel. The result: He promised to deliver them from Egyptian oppression. Here, and in the next two verses, the repetitive manner in describing what God saw and would do, served to underscore all the more His personal involvement in the history of His people whom He had sent into Egypt.</com>
<com id="com02003008"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:8">3:8</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">to a good and spacious land, to a land … to the place.</b> Three descriptions of the land to which Israel was going to be taken emphatically underscored the land promise of the Abrahamic Covenant. <b type="b_blue">flowing with milk and honey.</b> A formal and graphic way of describing a fertile land of bounteous provision. <b type="b_blue">the Canaanite and the Hittite.</b> A specific identification of the territory to which Israel was going; her Promised Land was currently inhabited by other peoples.</com>
<com id="com02003010"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:10">3:10</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">I will send you.</b> The divine summons made Moses both leader/deliverer of Israel and ambassador of God before Pharaoh.</com>
<com id="com02003011"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:11">3:11</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Who am I…?</b> The first response is an objection from Moses to the divine summons, an expression of inadequacy for such a serious mission. It sounded reasonable, for after 40 years of absence from Egypt, what could he, a mere shepherd in Midian, do upon return?</com>
<com id="com02003012"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:12">3:12</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Certainly I will be with you.</b> The divine promise, one given also to the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, should have been sufficient to quell all the chosen agent’s fears and sense of inadequacy for the task. <b type="b_blue">you shall serve God at this mountain.</b> A second divine promise signified the future success of the mission, suggesting that Israel would not be delivered simply out of bondage and oppression, but rescued to worship (cf. <xbr t="Ac 7:7">Ac 7:7</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02003013"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:13">3:13</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Then Moses said.</b> Was Moses at this point crossing the line from reasonable inquiry to unreasonable doubt? God’s patient replies instructing Moses on what He would do and what the results would be, including Israel’s being viewed with favor by the Egyptians (<xbr t="Ex 3:21">3:21</xbr>), ought to caution the reader from hastily classifying Moses’ attitude as altogether wrong from the very beginning of the interaction between him and Yahweh. A response of divine anger comes only in <xbr t="Ex 4:14">4:14</xbr> at the very end of Moses’ questions and objections. <i>See note on <xbr t="Ex 4:1">4:1</xbr>.</i> <b type="b_blue">What is His name?</b> Moses raised a second objection. Israel might ask for God’s name in validation of Moses’ declaration that he had been sent by the God of their fathers. Significantly, the question was not “Who is this God?” The Hebrews understood the name Yahweh had been known to the patriarchs (which Genesis well indicates). Asking “what” meant they sought for the relevancy of the name to their circumstances. “Who?” sought after title, name, and identity, whereas “What?” inquired into the character, quality, or essence of a person.</com>
<com id="com02003014"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:14">3:14</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">I AM WHO I AM.</b> This name for God points to His self-existence and eternality; it denotes “I am the One who is/will be,” which is decidedly the best and most contextually suitable option from a number of theories about its meaning and etymological source. The significance in relation to “God of your fathers” is immediately discernible: He’s the same God throughout the ages! The consonants from the Hebrew word <i>YHWH</i>, combined with the vowels from the divine name <i>Adonai</i> (Master or Lord), gave rise to the name “Jehovah” in English. Since the name <i>Yahweh</i> was considered so sacred that it should not be pronounced, the Massoretes inserted the vowels from <i>Adonai</i> to remind themselves to pronounce it when reading instead of saying <i>Yahweh</i>. Technically, this combination of consonants is known as the “tetragrammaton.”</com>
<com id="com02003015"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:15-22">3:15–22</xbr></bcv> Having provided Moses with His name in response to his second inquiry, God then furnished him with two speeches, one for Israel’s elders (vv. <xbr t="Ex 3:16-17">16–17</xbr>) and one for Pharaoh (v. <xbr t="Ex 3:18">18b</xbr>). Also included was notification of the elders’ positive response to Moses’ report (v. <xbr t="Ex 3:18">18a</xbr>), of Pharaoh’s refusal to grant them their request (v. <xbr t="Ex 3:19">19</xbr>), of God’s miraculous, judgmental reaction (v. <xbr t="Ex 3:20">20</xbr>), and of Israel’s plundering of the Egyptians, who found themselves responding favorably to the departing nation’s request for silver, gold, and clothing (vv. <xbr t="Ex 3:21-22">21–22</xbr>). The last of these harkens back to God’s promise to Abraham that his descendants would come out of the land of their affliction with great possessions (<xbr t="Ge 15:14">Ge 15:14</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02003015a"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:15">3:15</xbr></bcv> Cf. <xbr t="Mt 22:32">Mt 22:32</xbr>; <xbr t="Mk 12:26">Mk 12:26</xbr>; <xbr t="Ac 3:13">Ac 3:13</xbr>.</com>
<com id="com02003016"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:16">3:16</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">elders.</b> Lit. “bearded ones,” which indicated the age and wisdom needed to lead.</com>

<com id="com02003018"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:18">3:18</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">three days’ journey.</b> The request for a 3-day journey to worship, in the light of 1) direct promises of deliverance from Egypt, 2) worship at Horeb, and 3) entrance into Canaan, was not a ruse to get out and then not return, but an initial, moderate request to highlight the intransigence of Pharaoh—he just would not let these slaves leave under any conditions (v. <xbr t="Ex 3:19">19</xbr>)!</com>
<com id="com02003022"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 3:22">3:22</xbr></bcv> <i>See note on <xbr t="Ex 12:36">12:36</xbr>.</i></com>
<com id="com02004001"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 4:1">4:1</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Then Moses answered.</b> In a third objection, Moses gave an unworthy response, after the lengthy explanation by God to Moses in <xbr t="Ex 3:14-22">3:14–22</xbr>. At this point, the hypothetical situation proposed became more objection than reasonable inquiry.</com>
<com id="com02004002"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 4:2-9">4:2–9</xbr></bcv> In response to the hypothetical situation of Israel’s rejecting God as having appeared to him, Moses was given 3 signs to accredit him as the chosen spokesman and leader. Note the purpose stated: “That they may believe that Yahweh … appeared to you” (v. <xbr t="Ex 4:5">5</xbr>). Two of these signs personally involved Moses right then and there—the rod to snake and back, the hand leprous and healed. No matter what the situation Moses could envision himself facing, God had sufficient resources to authenticate His man, and Moses was not to think otherwise.</com>
<com id="com02004010"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 4:10">4:10</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">I have never been a man of words.</b> With his fourth argument, Moses focused on his speech disability, describing himself lit. as not being “a man of words,” as being “<i>one</i> with a hard mouth and a hard tongue,” i.e., unable to articulate his thoughts in fluent, flowing speech. An ancient document, <i>The Tale of the Eloquent Peasant</i>, suggests that eloquence was important in Egyptian culture, something which Moses would have well known from his time in the court. <b type="b_blue">neither recently nor in time past.</b> This is a pointed and inappropriate, if not impolite, criticism that somehow in all the discussion God had overlooked Moses’ speech disability. Unless this disability changed, Moses believed that he could not undertake the assigned task (cf. <xbr t="Ex 6:12">6:12</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02004011"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 4:11-12">4:11–12</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Who has made man’s mouth?</b> Three rhetorical questions from God shut the door on any complaints or criticisms about being clumsy of speech. The follow-up command, “So now, go” including its promise of divine help in speech forbade all such objections.</com>
<com id="com02004013"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 4:13-16">4:13–16</xbr></bcv> Moses’ fifth and final statement, notwithstanding the opening supplication, “Please, Lord,” was a polite way of bluntly saying, “Choose someone else, not me!” The anger of God toward this overt expression of reluctance was appropriate, yet Yahweh still provided another way for His plan to move forward unhindered. Providentially (v. <xbr t="Ex 4:27">27</xbr>), Aaron would meet his brother Moses, and positively respond to being the spokesman.</com>
<com id="com02004015"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 4:15">4:15</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">and I will instruct you.</b> The plural pronoun “you” means that God had promised to assist both of them in their newly appointed duties.</com>
<com id="com02004016"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 4:16">4:16</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">you will become as God to him.</b> Aaron would speak to the people for Moses, even as Moses would speak to Aaron for Yahweh.</com>

Pharaoh was also warned that his own refusal would bring judgment on him (v. <xbr t="Ex 4:23">23</xbr>). Previously Moses had been told that God was certain of Pharaoh’s refusal (<xbr t="Ex 3:19">3:19</xbr>). This interplay between God’s hardening and Pharaoh’s hardening his heart must be kept in balance.

The Apostle Paul used this hardening as an example of God’s inscrutable will and absolute power to intervene as He chooses, yet obviously never without loss of personal responsibility for actions taken (<xbr t="Ro 9:16-18">Ro 9:16–18</xbr>). The theological conundrum posed by such interplay of God’s acting and Pharaoh’s acting can only be resolved by accepting the record as it stands and by taking refuge in the omniscience and omnipotence of the God who planned and brought about His deliverance of Israel from Egypt, and in so doing also judged Pharaoh’s sinfulness. <i>See note at <xbr t="Ex 9:12">9:12</xbr>.</i></com>
<com id="com02004022"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 4:22">4:22</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">My son, My firstborn.</b> To the ancient Egyptians, the firstborn son was special and sacred, and the Pharaoh considered himself the only son of the gods. Now he heard of a whole nation designated as God’s firstborn son, meaning “declared and treated as first in rank, preeminent, with the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of being actually the firstborn.” Yahweh pointedly referred to the nation collectively in the singular in order to show that He was a father in what He would do, i.e., bring a nation into existence, then nurture and lead him (cf. <xbr t="De 14:1-2">Dt 14:1–2</xbr>). Divine sonship, as in the pagan world’s perverted concept of a sexual union between the gods and women, was never so much as hinted at in the way God used the term to express His relationship with Israel, who were His people, a treasured possession, a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation (cf. <xbr t="Ex 6:7">6:7</xbr>; <xbr t="Ex 19:4-6">19:4–6</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02004024"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 4:24-26">4:24–26</xbr></bcv> The presence of Zipporah’s name indicates that the personal pronouns refer to Moses. She, judging by her action of suddenly and swiftly circumcising her son, understood that the danger to her husband’s life was intimately connected to the family’s not bearing the sign of the covenant given to Abraham for all his descendants (<xbr t="Ge 17:10-14">Ge 17:10–14</xbr>). Her evaluation, “You are indeed a bridegroom of blood to me,” suggests her own revulsion with this rite of circumcision, which Moses should have performed. The result, however, was God’s foregoing the threat and letting Moses go (v. <xbr t="Ex 4:26">26a</xbr>). The reaction of God at this point dramatically underscored the seriousness of the sign He had prescribed. <i>See note on <xbr t="Je 4:4">Jer 4:4</xbr>.</i></com>

Mention of Levi in company with Reuben and Simeon recalled, perhaps, the unsavory background belonging to these three tribal fathers (<xbr t="Ge 49:3-7">Ge 49:3–7</xbr>) and emphasized that the choice of Moses and Aaron was not due to an exemplary lineage.

Its ancient documents record the activities of the magicians, one of the most prominent being the charming of serpents. These men were also styled “wise men” and “sorcerers,” i.e., the learned men of the day and the religious as well (the word for sorcery being derived from a word meaning “to offer prayers”). Two of these men were named Jannes and Jambres (cf. <xbr t="2Ti 3:8">2Ti 3:8</xbr>). Any supernatural power came from Satan (cf. <xbr t="2Co 11:13-15">2Co 11:13–15</xbr>). <b type="b_blue">secret arts.</b> By means of their “witchcraft,” the wise men, sorcerers, and magicians demonstrated their abilities to perform a similar feat. Whether by optical illusion, sleight of hand, or learned physical manipulation of a snake, all sufficiently skillful enough to totally fool Pharaoh and his servants, or by evil supernaturalism, the evaluation given in the inspired record is simply “they also … did the same” (<xbr t="Ex 7:22">7:22</xbr>). However, the turning of rods into snakes, and later turning water into blood (<xbr t="Ex 7:22">7:22</xbr>) and calling forth frogs (<xbr t="Ex 8:7">8:7</xbr>), were not the same as trying to create gnats from inanimate dust (<xbr t="Ex 8:18-19">8:18–19</xbr>). At that point, the magicians had no option but to confess their failure.</com>
<com id="com02007012"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 7:12">7:12</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs.</b> The loss of the magicians’ staffs in this fashion gave evidence of the superiority of God’s power when Aaron’s staff gulped down theirs.</com>

The croaking of frogs from the river and pools of water signaled to farmers that the gods who controlled the Nile’s flooding and receding had once again made the land fertile. The god Hapi was venerated on this occasion because he had caused alluvial deposits to come downstream. Further, the frog was the representation, the image, of the goddess Heqt, the wife of the god Khum, and the symbol of resurrection and fertility. The presence of frogs in such abundance, all over everywhere outside and inside the houses (vv. <xbr t="Ex 8:3">3</xbr>, <xbr t="Ex 8:13">13</xbr>), however, brought only frustration, dismay, and much discomfort, rather than the normal signal that the fields were ready for cultivating and harvesting.</com>

Egyptian literature and paintings substantiate how valuable livestock was to them. Whatever the exact nature of this pestilence—anthrax, murrain, or other livestock disease—it was clearly contagious and fatal. Religious implications were obvious: Egypt prized the bull as a sacred animal with special attention and worship being given to the Apis bull, the sacred animal of the god Ptah. Heliopolis venerated the bull, Mnevis. Further, the goddess Hathor, represented by a cow, or a cow-woman image, was worshiped in several cities.</com>

Although they are not mentioned after the third plague, they apparently had continued to serve before Pharaoh and were undoubtedly there when plagues 4 and 5 were announced. Their powerlessness had not been sufficient as yet for Pharaoh to dispense with their services—an outward symbol, perhaps, of Pharaoh’s unwillingness to grant the God of Israel total sovereignty.</com>

In the other instances, the record observes that Pharaoh hardened his own heart. Each instance records “as Yahweh commanded,” so what happened did so from two closely related perspectives: 1) God was carrying out His purpose through Pharaoh, and 2) Pharaoh was personally responsible for his actions as the command of v. 13 implies. <i>See note on <xbr t="Ex 4:21">4:21</xbr>.</i></com>

As a result of the plagues, Egypt could not keep her humiliation hidden from other nations. 2) A declaration that whatever royal authority Pharaoh had, it had been because of God’s sovereign and providential control of world affairs, which included putting Pharaoh on his throne. This was a telling reminder that He was what He declared Himself to be, the one and only true and immanent Lord. 3) A reminder of the worst scenario for Egypt if Yahweh had chosen, in lieu of the preceding plagues, to strike the people first—they would have perished. In other words, God had been gracious and longsuffering in the progression of the plagues. 4) A declaration that the weather about to be unleashed by the incomparable God was unlike anything previously recorded in Egypt’s entire history, or “since its founding” or “since it became a nation.” 5) An instruction as to how the Egyptians could avoid severe storm damage and loss of property.

<com id="com02010004"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 10:4-6">10:4–6</xbr></bcv> The extent and intensity of the locust plague was such that it would be unique in Egyptian history—nothing like any locust problem during the previous two generations, nor like any locust swarm in the future (v. <xbr t="Ex 10:14">14</xbr>). Locust invasions were feared in Egypt, to the point that the farmers often prayed to the locust god to ensure the safety of their crops.

That Israel had light in their dwellings and went about their normal activity stresses the supernatural nature of this plague. It takes attention away from trying to explain the darkness solely in terms of the Khamsin, the swirling sandstorms of the day. The LXX did, however, string together 3 Greek words, two for darkness and one for storm, to portray the nuance of the Hebrew. In so doing, it may unwittingly have given some credence to a severe sandstorm. Theologically, such thick darkness directly challenged the faithfulness of the sun god, Ra, to provide warmth and sunshine from day to day, and also prevented any daily worship rituals from taking place.</com>

If the instructions for the Passover (<xbr t="Ex 12:1-20">12:1–20</xbr>) were not given during the days of darkness, then 4 days minimum would be required to set the stage for that special feast day, i.e., from the tenth to the fourteenth day (<xbr t="Ex 12:3">12:3</xbr>, <xbr t="Ex 12:6">6</xbr>). <i>See note on <xbr t="Ex 8:23">8:23</xbr>.</i> <b type="b_blue">I am going out.</b> God was, of course, involved in all previous plagues through whatever means He chose to use, but this time, to warrant personal attention, God stated that He Himself (emphatic personal pronoun used) would march throughout the land. Note the repeated “I will” statements in the Passover instructions (<xbr t="Ex 12:12-13">12:12–13</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02011005"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 11:5">11:5</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">the firstborn.</b> The firstborn held a particularly important position in the family and society, not only inheriting a double portion of the father’s estate, but also representing special qualities of life and strength (cf. <xbr t="Ge 49:3">Ge 49:3</xbr>). In Egypt, the firstborn would ascend to the throne and continue the dynasty. Whatever significance might have been attached religiously, politically, dynastically, and socially, it was all stripped away by the extent and intensity of the plague—namely the execution of all the firstborn of all classes of the population including their animals.</com>
<com id="com02011006"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 11:6">11:6</xbr></bcv> So drastic was this plague that its uniqueness in Egypt’s history, already past and yet to come, was noted in the warning.</com>
<com id="com02011007"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 11:7">11:7</xbr></bcv> In contrast to the turmoil and grief experienced in Egyptian territory, all remained tranquil in Israelite territory—so much so that not even a dog barked. That Yahweh had made and was making a sharp distinction between the two peoples was a fact to which none could be blind.</com>
<com id="com02012001"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:1">12:1</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Yahweh said.</b> Most probably, the instructions on the Passover (vv. <xbr t="Ex 12:1-20">1–20</xbr>) were also given during the 3 days of darkness in order to fully prepare Israel for the grand finale, their Exodus from Egypt. <b type="b_blue">in the land.</b> Later, while Israel was in the wilderness, Moses wrote (<xbr t="Ex 23:14-17">23:14–17</xbr>; <xbr t="De 16:1-8">Dt 16:1–8</xbr>) and indicated that the detailed instructions for this very special feast day in Israel’s religious calendar were not like those of the other special days, all which were given after the nation had already left Egypt. This one, the Passover, was inextricably linked to what took place in the Exodus, and that connection was never to be forgotten. It became indelibly entrenched in Israel’s tradition and has always marked the day of redemption from Egypt.</com>

<com id="com02012002"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:2">12:2</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">This month.</b> The month of Abib (Mar./Apr.) by divine decree became the beginning of the religious calendar, marking the start of Israel’s life as a nation. Later in Israel’s history, after the Babylonian captivity, Abib would become Nisan (cf. <xbr t="Ne 2:1">Ne 2:1</xbr>; <xbr t="Es 3:7">Es 3:7</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02012003"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:3-14">12:3–14</xbr></bcv> The detailed instructions for the Passover included what animal to select, when to kill it, what to do with its blood, how to cook it, what to do with leftovers, how to dress for the meal, the reason why it was being celebrated “in haste,” and what the shed blood signified.</com>
<com id="com02012005"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:5">12:5</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Your lamb … without blemish.</b> A kid goat was an alternative choice. Any flaw would render it unfit to represent a pure, wholesome sacrifice given to Yahweh.</com>
<com id="com02012006"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:6">12:6</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">at twilight.</b> Lit. “between the two evenings.” Since the new day was reckoned from sunset, the sacrificing of the lamb or kid was done before sunset while it was still day 14 of the first month. “Twilight” has been taken to signify either that time between sunset and the onset of darkness, or from the decline of the sun until sunset. Later Moses would prescribe the time for the sacrifice as “in the evening at sunset” (<xbr t="De 16:6">Dt 16:6</xbr>). According to Josephus, it was customary in his day to kill the lamb at about 3:00 p.m. This was the time of day that Christ, the Christian’s Passover lamb (<xbr t="1Co 5:7">1Co 5:7</xbr>), died (<xbr t="Lu 23:44-46">Lk 23:44–46</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02012009"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:9">12:9</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Do not eat any of it raw.</b> A prohibition with health implications which also distinguished them from pagan peoples who often ate raw flesh in their sacred festivals.</com>
<com id="com02012012"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:12">12:12</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">against all the gods.</b> The tenth plague was a judgment against all Egyptian deities. The loss of the firstborn of men and beasts had far-reaching theological implications, namely, the impotence of the pagan deities, many of whom were represented by animals, to protect their devotees from such nationwide tragedies. The great cry of grief (<xbr t="Ex 11:6">11:6</xbr>; <xbr t="Ex 12:30">12:30</xbr>) may also have bemoaned the incapability of the nation’s gods.</com>
<com id="com02012014"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:14">12:14</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">a memorial.</b> The details of how this Passover Day was to be memorialized in future years were laid down (vv. <xbr t="Ex 12:14-20">14–20</xbr>), and then repeated in the instructions to the elders (vv. <xbr t="Ex 12:21-27">21–27</xbr>). Prescribing the eating of unleavened bread for 7 days, demanding a thorough housecleaning from leaven (v. <xbr t="Ex 12:15">15</xbr>), issuing a stern warning of banishment for eating leaven (v. <xbr t="Ex 12:15">15</xbr>), and bracketing the 7 days with special holy days (v. <xbr t="Ex 12:16">16</xbr>), served to proclaim the high importance of the nation’s remembering this event.</com>
<com id="com02012019"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:19">12:19</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">a sojourner.</b> Provision was made right at the beginning for non-Israelites to be included in the nation’s religious festivals. Failure to comply with the regulations on leaven would result in banishment for the sojourner as well.</com>
<com id="com02012022"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:22">12:22</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">bunch of hyssop.</b> Certain identification is impossible, but this could be the marjoram plant. <b type="b_blue">lintel … the two doorposts.</b> The top and two sides of the doorway.</com>
<com id="com02012023"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:23">12:23</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">the destroyer.</b> This is most likely the angel of Yahweh (cf. <xbr t="2Sa 24:16">2Sa 24:16</xbr>; <xbr t="Is 37:36">Is 37:36</xbr>). <i>See note on <xbr t="Ex 3:2">3:2</xbr>.</i></com>
<com id="com02012025"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:25">12:25</xbr></bcv> The promise of entering the land again received emphasis. Israel was not to think of the Exodus as merely a departure from Egypt, but rather as a departure from one land in order to enter another land, which would be their own, in strict accordance with the specifics of the Abrahamic Covenant for his descendants through Isaac and Jacob (cf. <xbr t="Ge 17:7-8">Ge 17:7–8</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02012026"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:26-27">12:26–27</xbr></bcv> In the annual commemoration of the Passover, parents were obligated to teach their children its meaning. It became customary for the youngest child of a Jewish family to elicit the father’s formal explanation of what happened in connection with the original observance of the meal in Egypt.</com>
<com id="com02012031"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:31">12:31</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Rise up, get out … serve Yahweh.</b> Finally, Pharaoh’s response to the repeated “Let My people go!” became “Leave my people!” with no attempt at further negotiation, but total acquiescence. His subjects, fearing more deaths, concurred and hastened Israel’s departure (v. <xbr t="Ex 12:33">33</xbr>), driving them out with no time wasted (v. <xbr t="Ex 12:39">39</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02012032"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:32">12:32</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">bless me also.</b> Undoubtedly, this final request from Pharaoh, whose heart was certainly not repentant (<xbr t="Ex 14:8">14:8</xbr>), temporarily conceded defeat and acknowledged Moses and his God as the victors and as those who had the power and resources to bless him.</com>
<com id="com02012036"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:36">12:36</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">they plundered the Egyptians.</b> Cf. <xbr t="Ge 15:14">Ge 15:14</xbr>; <xbr t="Ex 3:20-21">Ex 3:20–21</xbr>. This was not done with deceit, but rather a straightforward request (cf. <xbr t="Ex 11:2-3">11:2–3</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02012037"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:37-18:27">12:37—18:27</xbr></bcv> This section recounts the march of the Israelites from Egypt to Mt. Sinai.</com>
<com id="com02012037a"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:37">12:37</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Rameses to Succoth.</b> One of the cities Israel built (<xbr t="Ex 1:11">1:11</xbr>) headed up the itinerary for the journey through the wilderness to Canaan. Succoth is first mentioned in <xbr t="Ge 33:17">Ge 33:17</xbr> as an encampment designated by the word <i>Succoth</i>, which means “booth.” Although there is later a town by that name east of the Jordan (cf. <xbr t="Jdg 8:5-16">Jdg 8:5–16</xbr>), this is rather a place near Egypt (cf. <xbr t="Ex 13:20">13:20</xbr>; <xbr t="Nu 33:5-6">Nu 33:5–6</xbr>). <b type="b_blue">six hundred thousand men on foot.</b> A conservative estimate based on the number of men, probably the fighting men 20 years of age and above, would give a population of 2 million. Israel’s population had exploded from the 70 who entered with Jacob in 1875 BC to the 2 million who left with Moses in 1445 BC. <i>See note on <xbr t="Ex 1:7">1:7</xbr>.</i></com>
<com id="com02012038"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:38">12:38</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">A foreign multitude.</b> Other Semitic peoples, other races, and perhaps some native Egyptians accompanied the departing nation. They preferred to be identified with the victorious nation and Jehovah God. Later, some of these became the troublemakers with whom Moses had to deal (<xbr t="Nu 11:4">Nu 11:4</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02012040"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:40-41">12:40–41</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">430 years.</b> Abraham had been told that his descendants would be aliens mistreated in a foreign land for 400 years, using a figure rounded to hundreds (<xbr t="Ge 15:13">Ge 15:13</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02012043"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:43-51">12:43–51</xbr></bcv> Additional regulations given for the holding of the Passover contained prohibitions on any uncircumcised foreigner, stranger, or hired servant being a valid participant. To partake of this meal, non-Israelites had to be “like a native of the land” (v. <xbr t="Ex 12:48">48</xbr>). <i>See note on <xbr t="Je 4:4">Jer 4:4</xbr>.</i></com>
<com id="com02012046"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:46">12:46</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">break any bone.</b> Christ, the Christian’s Passover lamb (<xbr t="1Co 5:7">1Co 5:7</xbr>), had no bones broken (<xbr t="Jn 19:36">Jn 19:36</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02012050"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:50">12:50</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">So all … did</b><bi type="bi_blue">.</bi> On two occasions (see also v. <xbr t="Ex 12:28">28</xbr>) Moses emphasized the complete obedience of the nation in response to Yahweh’s commands to them: a contrast to the disobedience they would demonstrate in the very near future.</com>
<com id="com02012051"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 12:51">12:51</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">on that same day.</b> What would be for the nation in their new land a special Sabbath day, was for them at that time the day on which their journey began.</com>
<com id="com02013002"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 13:2-10">13:2–10</xbr></bcv> Further explanation tied their departure to the divine promise of entrance and residence in a new land where commemoration of the Exodus would occur through annual observance of this 7 day feast. Again the pedagogical opportunity afforded was not to be overlooked (vv. <xbr t="Ex 13:8">8</xbr>, <xbr t="Ex 13:16">16</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02013002a"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 13:2">13:2</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Sanctify to Me every firstborn.</b> Since the firstborn of Israel, of both man and animal, were untouched by the tenth plague, it was fitting that they be set aside as special unto God. Note the closing emphasis: “It belongs to Me.” Further instruction followed on the law relating to the firstborn males once they were in their assigned territory (vv. <xbr t="Ex 13:11-16">11–16</xbr>). This divine demand was closely linked to the day of departure (<xbr t="Ex 12:51">12:51</xbr>, “on that same day”) and the Feast of Unleavened Bread (v. <xbr t="Ex 13:3">3</xbr>, “this day” and v. <xbr t="Ex 13:4">4</xbr>, “This day, in the month of Abib”). See <xbr t="Lu 2:7">Lk 2:7</xbr>, where Christ was referred to as Mary’s firstborn.</com>
<com id="com02013008"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 13:8">13:8</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">for me when I.</b> A personalized application of God’s working belonged to the first generation who experienced the Exodus. Later generations could only say “for us, when we. …” in the sense of “our nation,” but without loss to the significance of how God had brought about such an important day in the nation’s history. Note the personalized application of the law of the firstborn as well (v. <xbr t="Ex 13:15">15</xbr>, “I sacrifice … my sons I redeem”).</com>
<com id="com02013009"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 13:9">13:9</xbr></bcv> Later generations would translate this figurative and proverbial expression (cf. <xbr t="Pr 3:3">Pr 3:3</xbr>; <xbr t="Pr 6:21">6:21</xbr>) into the physical reality of phylacteries—the leather prayer-boxes which were strapped on the left arm and on the forehead. Four strips of parchment inscribed with certain words (<xbr t="Ex 13:1-16">13:1–16</xbr>; <xbr t="De 6:4-9">Dt 6:4–9</xbr>; <xbr t="De 11:13-21">11:13–21</xbr>) were placed inside these boxes. The imagery of the proverbial mode of speech signified that their conduct was to be that of someone who could verbally recall what God’s law demanded of them. Yahweh, who had rescued them, had also provided the standards of life for them!</com>

<com id="com02013017"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 13:17">13:17</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">by the way of the land of the Philistines.</b> Travelers going east and northeast out of Egypt had two good options: “the way of the sea,” or “the way of Shur.” The first route, the most direct and shortest, was dotted with Egyptian fortresses which monitored arrivals and departures to and from Egypt. A little further north, Philistine territory also presented a military threat. The lack of battle-readiness on Israel’s part deleted the first option, and God chose the second option (v. <xbr t="Ex 13:18">18</xbr>; <xbr t="Ex 15:22">15:22</xbr>). In any case, God had told Moses to lead the people to Horeb or Sinai, the mountain of God (<xbr t="Ex 3:1">3:1</xbr>), and not to take them immediately into Canaan (<xbr t="Ex 3:12">3:12</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02013018"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 13:18">13:18</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">the Red Sea.</b> An alternative designation, quite in accord with the Hebrew term, would be “Sea of Reeds,” or perhaps “of papyrus marshes.” The difficulty of precisely locating other names associated with the crossing of the Red Sea (see <xbr t="Ex 14:2">14:2</xbr>) has occasioned much debate on the location of the crossing. Four views have generally emerged: It was located 1) in the northeastern region of the Delta—but this would have been in effect “the way of the sea” and would not have been 3 days’ journey from Marah (<xbr t="Ex 15:22-23">15:22–23</xbr>); 2) in the northern end of the Gulf of Suez—but this rules out entry into the wilderness of Shur (<xbr t="Ex 15:22">15:22</xbr>); 3) in the vicinity of Lake Timsah or the southern extension of present-day Lake Menzaleh—but probably more than 3 days from Marah; and 4) in the Bitter Lakes region, satisfying, in terms of geography and time, all objections to the other options.</com>
<com id="com02013019"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 13:19">13:19</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">the bones of Joseph.</b> In fulfillment of their solemnly sworn duty and responsibility (<xbr t="Ge 50:24-26">Ge 50:24–26</xbr>), the Israelites took Joseph’s coffin with them. Some 360 years earlier he had foreseen the day when God would bring about the Exodus, and his instructions about his bones being carried to the Promised Land indicated just how certain he was of Israel’s departure for Canaan (cf. <xbr t="Ge 50:24-26">Ge 50:24–26</xbr>; <xbr t="Heb 11:22">Heb 11:22</xbr>). After the years of wilderness wanderings, Joseph’s remains reached their final resting place in Shechem (<xbr t="Jos 24:32">Jos 24:32</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02013020"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 13:20">13:20</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Etham on the edge of the wilderness.</b> The Hebrew name of this place may be a transliteration of the Egyptian word <i>Khetem</i> meaning “fortress.” A line of fortresses (<i>see note on v. <xbr t="Ex 13:17">17</xbr></i>) stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Suez.

The flow of thought and emphasis is also interesting. Stanza one briefly introduces God’s powerful victory (vv. <xbr t="Ex 15:1-5">1–5</xbr>). Stanza two graphically repeats the victory and then inserts the arrogant and vengeful assertions of victory by the enemy to show how puny they were (vv. <xbr t="Ex 15:6-10">6–10</xbr>). Stanza three concisely summarizes the victory after asking an appropriate question (vv. <xbr t="Ex 15:11-13">11–13</xbr>). Further, since the victory was essential for Israel’s rescue, the stanza also introduces them. Stanza four picks up and expands on Yahweh’s leading His people to their divinely assigned home and the consequent fear by other nations as they hear of Israel’s dramatic rescue from such a powerful enemy nation (vv. <xbr t="Ex 15:14-17">14–17</xbr>). The closing line sums it all up: “Yahweh shall reign forever and ever.” A narrative interlude (vv. <xbr t="Ex 15:19-20">19–20</xbr>) reminds of the theme behind the song, and introduces the antiphonal response of Miriam and her band of women (v. <xbr t="Ex 15:21">21</xbr>).</com>

Saul failed to destroy them as God ordered (<xbr t="1Sa 15:2-3">1Sa 15:2–3</xbr>, <xbr t="1Sa 15:9">9</xbr>). David later fought and defeated the Amalekites (<xbr t="1Sa 30:1-20">1Sa 30:1–20</xbr>). In Hezekiah’s day, the Amalekite remnant in the land was finally destroyed by Hezekiah (ca. 716–687 BC). The final descendants of Agag (<xbr t="Es 3:1">Es 3:1</xbr>), the Amalekite king in Saul’s day, were destroyed in Persia at the time of Esther and Mordecai (ca. 473 BC; <xbr t="Es 2:5">Es 2:5</xbr>, <xbr t="Es 2:8-10">8–10</xbr>).</com>

<com id="com02017009a"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 17:9">17:9</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Joshua.</b> The name of Moses’ aide-de-camp, or personal minister (<xbr t="Ex 24:13">24:13</xbr>; <xbr t="Ex 33:11">33:11</xbr>; <xbr t="Jos 1:1">Jos 1:1</xbr>) appears here for the first time in Exodus. His assignment to muster a task force was part of his being groomed for military leadership in Israel. Actually, at this stage his name was still Hoshea, which later changed to Joshua at Kadesh just before the reconnaissance mission in Canaan (<xbr t="Nu 13:16">Nu 13:16</xbr>). At this stage, Israel could not be described as a seasoned army and was not even militarily well prepared and trained. See <xref idref="intro06">Introduction to Joshua</xref>. <b type="b_blue">the staff of God.</b> The staff which Moses held up in his hands was no magic wand. Rather it had been previously used to initiate, via His chosen leader, the miracles which God did and about which He had informed Moses in advance. It became, therefore, the symbol of God’s personal and powerful involvement, with Moses’ outstretched arms perhaps signifying an appeal to God. The ebb and flow of battle in correlation with Moses’ uplifted or drooping arms imparted more than psychological encouragement as the soldiers looked up to their leader on the hilltop, and more than Moses’ interceding for them. It demonstrated and acknowledged their having to depend upon God for victory in battle and not upon their own strength and zeal. It also confirmed the position of Moses both in relation to God and the nation’s well-being and safety. They had angrily chided him for their problems, but God confirmed his appointment as leader.</com>

<com id="com02017014"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 17:14">17:14</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Write this … as a memorial and recite it.</b> Moses would have learned writing and record-keeping in Pharaoh’s school of government. Official Hebrew records other than Scripture were also to be kept, and in this case especially for the purpose of remembering the victory in the very first battle in which they nationally engaged. God referred to “a book,” so Moses had evidently already begun it. This was not, then, the initial entry into what perhaps became known as the “Book of the Wars of Yahweh” (<xbr t="Nu 21:14">Nu 21:14</xbr>). Writing it was essential, so the facts could be verified and needed not to depend upon human memory or solely oral tradition. <b type="b_blue">blot out the memory.</b> The sentence of national extinction which the Amalekites proclaimed for Israel (cf. <xbr t="Ps 83:4-7">Ps 83:4–7</xbr>) passed by divine decree upon the Amalekites. The sentence was partially realized in Saul’s and David’s day (cf. <xbr t="1Sa 15:1-9">1Sa 15:1–9</xbr> and <xbr t="2Sa 1:1">2Sa 1:1</xbr>; <xbr t="2Sa 8:11-12">8:11–12</xbr>), after which it is scarcely mentioned again. However, due to Saul’s disobedience in sparing Agag, the Amalekite king and some of his people (<xbr t="1Sa 15:7-9">1Sa 15:7–9</xbr>), he lost his throne (v. <xbr t="1Sa 15:23">23</xbr>). Samuel killed Agag (v. <xbr t="1Sa 15:33">33</xbr>), but some Amalekites remained to return a few years later to raid Israel’s southern territory, even capturing David’s family (<xbr t="1Sa 30:1-5">1Sa 30:1–5</xbr>). David killed all but 400 (<xbr t="1Sa 30:16-17">1Sa 30:16–17</xbr>) who escaped. It was a descendant of Agag, Haman, who tried to exterminate the Jews later in Esther’s day (cf. <xbr t="Es 3:1">Es 3:1</xbr>, <xbr t="Es 3:6">6</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02017015"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 17:15">17:15</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Yahweh is My Banner.</b> By titling the altar with this designation for Yahweh, Yahweh-Nissi, Moses declared Yahweh Himself to be the standard of His people.</com>

Contextually, the significance is clear, whatever the translation adopted: The ongoing problem with Amalek was not merely one nation hostile toward another, it was a war between God and Amalek.</com>
<com id="com02018001"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 18:1">18:1</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Jethro … heard of all.</b> The intelligence-gathering ability of ancient peoples should not be underestimated. Quickly and thoroughly the news of significant events in other lands passed from one place to another, very often via the merchant caravans which traversed the Fertile Crescent, or through ambassadors and other official contacts between nations. In Jethro’s case, whatever knowledge he had gleaned of Israel’s progress had been supplemented with information from Zipporah and her sons after Moses sent them ahead to her home (v. <xbr t="Ex 18:2">2</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02018007"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 18:7-12">18:7–12</xbr></bcv> Moses’ testimony elicited responses of praise and sacrifice from Jethro; evidence of his belief. Further, he understood fully the incomparability of Yahweh (v. <xbr t="Ex 18:11">11</xbr>). The priest of Midian (v. <xbr t="Ex 18:1">1</xbr>) was surely no worshiper of Midian’s gods! Since Midianites were generally regarded as idolaters (cf. <xbr t="Nu 25:17-18">Nu 25:17–18</xbr>; <xbr t="Nu 31:2-3">31:2–3</xbr>, <xbr t="Nu 31:16">16</xbr>), Jethro must be viewed as remarkably different from his contemporaries; a difference highlighted by Aaron and the elders worshiping and fellowshiping together with him (v. <xbr t="Ex 18:12">12</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02018012"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 18:12">18:12</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">for God.</b> Since the name Yahweh is always used in connection with sacrifices prescribed for Israel in the Pentateuch, the switch to Elohim must have some significance here, particularly after Jethro had himself used the name of Yahweh in his response to Moses. Despite the strong declaration of his faith and understanding, Jethro was a believing Gentile, therefore, a proselyte, and an alien. In this situation Yahweh was relating to the Israelite and Gentile world simultaneously, thus the use of Elohim rather than Yahweh, the unique covenant name for Israel.</com>
<com id="com02018013"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 18:13-27">18:13–27</xbr></bcv> Jethro’s practical wisdom was of immense benefit to Moses and Israel, and has been lauded as an example of delegation and management organization by efficiency experts for centuries—and still is. Woven into Jethro’s advice were statements about God and the virtues of godly men that cause one to respect this man as having his newfound faith well integrated into his thinking. Indeed, he fully recognized that Moses needed divine permission to enact his advice (v. <xbr t="Ex 18:23">23</xbr>). Moses apparently did not immediately implement Jethro’s solution, but waited until the law had been given (cf. <xbr t="De 1:9-15">Dt 1:9–15</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02018021"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 18:21">18:21</xbr></bcv> These same spiritual qualities were required of NT leaders (see <xbr t="Ac 6:3">Ac 6:3</xbr>; <xbr t="1Ti 3:1-7">1Ti 3:1–7</xbr>; <xbr t="Tit 1:6-9">Tit 1:6–9</xbr>).</com>

<com id="com02019003"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 19:3-8">19:3–8</xbr></bcv> The Israelites discerned the familiar pattern, in shortened form, of a suzerainty (superior-subordinate relationship) treaty in God’s words: a preamble (v. <xbr t="Ex 19:3">3</xbr>), a historical prologue (v. <xbr t="Ex 19:4">4</xbr>), certain stipulations (v. <xbr t="Ex 19:5">5a</xbr>), and blessings (vv. <xbr t="Ex 19:5-6">5b–6a</xbr>). The acceptance in solemn assembly would normally be recorded in the final treaty document. Here it follows upon presentation of the treaty to them (vv. <xbr t="Ex 19:7-8">7–8</xbr>). <i>See note on <xbr t="Ex 24:7">24:7</xbr>.</i></com>
<com id="com02019003a"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 19:3">19:3</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">from the mountain.</b> The sign which Yahweh had given particularly to Moses when he was still in Midian (<xbr t="Ex 3:12">3:12</xbr>), that God had indeed sent him, was now fulfilled; he was with the people before the mountain of God. <b type="b_blue">house of Jacob … sons of Israel.</b> In employing this dual designation for the nation, Yahweh reminded them of their humble beginnings as descendants of Abraham through Isaac and Jacob, who had been with them in Egypt, and of their status now as a nation (children = people).</com>
<com id="com02019004"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 19:4">19:4</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">lifted you up on eagles’ wings.</b> With a most appropriate metaphor, God described the Exodus and the journey to Sinai. Eagles were known to have carried their young out of the nests on their wings and taught them to fly, catching them when necessary on their outspread wings. Moses, in his final song, employed this metaphor of God’s care for Israel and especially noted that there was only one Lord who did this (<xbr t="De 32:11-12">Dt 32:11–12</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02019005"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 19:5-6">19:5–6</xbr></bcv> Three titles for Israel, “My treasured possession,” “a kingdom of priests,” and “a holy nation,” were given by Yahweh to the nation, contingent upon their being an obedient and covenant-keeping nation. These titles summarized the divine blessings which such a nation would experience: belonging especially to Yahweh, representing Him in the earth and being set apart unto Him for His purposes. These expanded ethnically and morally what it meant to have brought them to Himself. “For all the earth is Mine,” in the midst of the titles, laid stress upon the uniqueness and sovereignty of Yahweh and had to be understood as dismissing all other claims by so-called other gods of the nations. It was more than the power of one god over another in Israel’s situation; it was the choice and power of the only Lord! See <xbr t="1Pe 2:9">1Pe 2:9</xbr>, where Peter uses these terms in the sense of God’s spiritual kingdom of the redeemed.</com>
<com id="com02019008"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 19:8">19:8</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">all the people answered together.</b> Presented with the details of God’s bilateral, conditional covenant (note the “if you will listen … then you shall be” in v. <xbr t="Ex 19:5">5</xbr>), the people, briefed by their elders, responded with positive enthusiasm. Yahweh’s response to them does not take it as a rash promise by the people (cf. <xbr t="De 5:27-29">Dt 5:27–29</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02019009"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 19:9">19:9</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">believe in you forever.</b> Yahweh designed the upcoming encounter with Him so as to forestall any later accusation that Moses had himself compiled the law and had not met with Yahweh on the mountain.

<com id="com02019010"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 19:10">19:10</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">set them apart as holy.</b> How serious this step was for the nation was emphasized for them by two days of special preparation. The inward preparation for meeting with God was mirrored in the outward actions of maintaining bodily cleanliness.</com>
<com id="com02019012"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 19:12-13">19:12–13</xbr></bcv> The proper approach to a holy God could not have been better stressed than by imposing a death penalty upon those who violated the arbitrary boundaries which God had set around the mountain. Even animals could not encroach upon this sacred area (cf. <xbr t="Heb 12:20">Heb 12:20</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02019015"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 19:15">19:15</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">do not go near a woman.</b> This was so they would be ceremonially clean (see <xbr t="Le 15:16-18">Lv 15:16–18</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02019016"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 19:16">19:16</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">thunder and lightning.</b> The dramatic visual presentation of God’s presence on the mountain, accompanied by thick cloud and trumpet blast, more than impressed the onlookers with God’s majesty and power—they trembled, but so did Moses (<xbr t="Heb 12:21">Heb 12:21</xbr>). The unusual was happening, not the usual phenomena from volcanic activity, as some writers have proposed.</com>
<com id="com02019024"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 19:24">19:24</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">the priests.</b> With the law still to be given, no priesthood had been established in Israel.

Their place would be taken over later by the Levites (<xbr t="Nu 3:45">Nu 3:45</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02020001"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 20:1">20:1</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">all these words.</b> This general description of the commands to follow also received from Moses the title “Ten Commandments” (<xbr t="Ex 34:28">34:28</xbr>; <xbr t="De 4:13">Dt 4:13</xbr>). By this emphasis on God Himself speaking these words (cf. <xbr t="De 5:12">Dt 5:12</xbr>, <xbr t="De 5:15-16">15–16</xbr>, <xbr t="De 5:22">22</xbr>, <xbr t="De 5:32-33">32–33</xbr>), all theories on Israel’s borrowing legal patterns or concepts from the nations around them are unacceptable.</com>
<com id="com02020003"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 20:3-17">20:3–17</xbr></bcv> The Ten Commandments, also known as the Decalogue, which follow upon the opening historical prologue (v. <xbr t="Ex 20:2">2</xbr>), are formed as a precept or direct command given in the second person. This form was something rather uncommon in that day. Ancient Near Eastern law codes for the most part were casuistic, or case-law, in form, i.e., an “if … then” construction written in the third person wherein a supposed offense was followed by a statement of the action to be taken or penalty to be exacted. The Ten Commandments may also be grouped into two broad categories: the vertical, namely man’s relationship to God (vv. <xbr t="Ex 20:2-11">2–11</xbr>), and the horizontal, namely man’s relationship to the community (vv. <xbr t="Ex 20:12-17">12–17</xbr>). Concisely listed prohibitions mark the second category, with only one exception—an imperative plus its explanation (v. <xbr t="Ex 20:12">12</xbr>). Explanation or reason appended to a prohibition marks the first category. By these Ten Commandments, true theology and true worship, the name of God, the Sabbath, family honor, life, marriage, property, truth, and virtue are well protected. <i>See note on <xbr t="Ex 24:7">24:7</xbr>.</i></com>
<com id="com02020003a"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 20:3">20:3</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">before Me.</b> Meaning “over against Me,” this is a most appropriate expression in the light of the next few verses. All false gods stand in opposition to the true God, and the worship of them is incompatible with the worship of Yahweh. When Israel departed from the worship of the only one and true God, she plunged into religious confusion (<xbr t="Jdg 17-18">Jdg 17–18</xbr>).</com>

Total censure of artistic expression was not the issue; the absolute censure of idolatry and false worship was the issue. Violation would seriously affect succeeding generations because Yahweh demanded full and exclusive devotion, i.e., He is a jealous God (cf. <xbr t="Ex 34:14">34:14</xbr>; <xbr t="De 4:24">Dt 4:24</xbr>; <xbr t="De 5:9">5:9</xbr>).

Children reared in such an environment would imbibe and then practice similar idolatry, thus themselves expressing hateful disobedience. The difference in consequence served as both a warning and a motivation. The effect of a disobedient generation was to plant wickedness so deeply that it took several generations to reverse.</com>

To fail to perform an oath in which His name had been legitimately uttered (cf. <xbr t="Ex 22:10-11">22:10–11</xbr>; <xbr t="Le 19:12">Lv 19:12</xbr>; <xbr t="De 6:13">Dt 6:13</xbr>) was to call into question His existence, since the guilty party evidently had no further thought of the God whose name he had used to improve his integrity. For the believer in the church age, however, the use of the name of God is not a needed verification of his intention and trustworthiness, since his life is to exhibit truth on all occasions, with his “yes” meaning “yes” and his “no” meaning “no” (<xbr t="Mt 5:37">Mt 5:37</xbr>; <xbr t="Jam 5:12">Jas 5:12</xbr>).</com>

Each seventh day belonged to Yahweh and would not be a work day but one set apart (i.e., holy) for rest and for time devoted to the worship of Yahweh. The term “Sabbath” is derived from “to rest or cease from work.” The historical precedent for such a special observance was the creation week; a span of time equal to what man copied in practice. Each Sabbath day should have reminded the worshiper that the God whom he praised had indeed made everything in both realms of existence in 6 twenty-four-hour days. The Sabbath would also stand, therefore, as a counter to evolutionary ideas prevalent in false religion. Moses, in the review of the Decalogue, also linked the observance of the Sabbath with Israel’s exodus from Egypt and specified that this was why Israel was to keep it (<xbr t="De 5:12-15">Dt 5:12–15</xbr>). Significantly, the command for the Sabbath is not repeated in the NT, whereas the other 9 are. In fact, it is nullified (cf. <xbr t="Col 2:16-17">Col 2:16–17</xbr>). Belonging especially to Israel under the Mosaic economy, the Sabbath could not apply to the believer of the church age, for he is living in a new economy.</com>

Severe consequences, namely capital punishment, could apply (cf. <xbr t="De 21:18-21">Dt 21:18–21</xbr>). One of the reasons for the Babylonian exile was a failure to honor parents (<xbr t="Eze 22:7">Eze 22:7</xbr>, <xbr t="Eze 22:15">15</xbr>).

Further, the sacredness of human life stands out in the passages dealing with unintentional manslaughter. The accident of death still carried with it a penalty of banishment to the city of refuge until the death of the High Priest for the one who killed someone unintentionally. Careful appraisal of the word Moses used (one of 7 different Hebrew words for killing, and one used only 47 times in the OT) suggests a broad translation of “to kill, slay” but denoting the taking of life under a legal system where he would have to answer to the stipulations of a legal code, no matter whether he killed unintentionally or intentionally.

No degree of sanctuary applied to one guilty of premeditated murder. Death by accident at the hand of another is something unplanned by man but which God let happen. The law did afford sanctuary but away from home and vengeful relatives, often for life, because there the one guilty of involuntary manslaughter remained until the death of the High Priest (<xbr t="Nu 35:25">Nu 35:25</xbr>, <xbr t="Nu 35:28">28</xbr>).</com>

Judges were to decide the appropriate punishment if the slave died (v. <xbr t="Ex 21:20">20</xbr>). If the slave lived a few days it was evidence that the owner had no intent to kill, and the loss of the slave was punishment enough (v. <xbr t="Ex 21:21">21</xbr>). A beating without death immediately ensuing was construed as a disciplinary matter, not a homicidal one. Any permanent personal injury brought freedom and loss of a master’s investment.

The awe-inspiring sight of God’s glory cloud, the Shekinah, resting on the mountain and into which Moses disappeared for 40 days and nights, impressed everyone with the singular importance of this event in Israel’s history. During these days Moses received all the instructions on the tabernacle and its furnishings and accoutrements (chaps. <xbr t="Ex 25-31">25–31</xbr>). The settling of the Shekinah upon the tabernacle at its completion impressed the Israelites with the singular importance of this structure in Israel’s worship of and relationship to Yahweh (<xbr t="Ex 40:34-38">40:34–38</xbr>).</com>

In preparation for occupation of their land, they had been given a system of law to regulate individual and national life, to prevent exploitation of the poor and the stranger, and to safeguard against polytheism and idolatry. That these safeguards were needed was confirmed by the idolatrous golden calf incident (<xbr t="Ex 32:1-35">32:1–35</xbr>). The very detailed and divinely given blueprint of the tabernacle removes all speculation about whether it has any comparison with, or was somehow derived from, the little portable sanctuaries belonging to various tribal deities. The origin of the tabernacle was found in God and delivered to Moses by special revelation (cf. <xbr t="Ex 25:9">25:9</xbr>, <xbr t="Ex 25:40">40</xbr>; <xbr t="Ex 26:30">26:30</xbr>; <xbr t="Heb 8:5">Heb 8:5</xbr>).</com>

<fign>The tabernacle was to provide a place where God might dwell among His people. The term <i>tabernacle</i> sometimes refers to the tent, including the holy place and the holy of holies, which was covered with embroidered curtains. But in other places it refers to the entire complex, including the curtained court in which the tent stood.</fign>

Aaron and his descendants, as well as the tribe of Levi, were selected by God to be Israel’s priests—they did not appoint themselves to the position.

<com id="com02039033"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 39:33">39:33</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">They brought the tabernacle to Moses.</b> Attestations of obedience and accuracy provide, as it were, an envelope (vv. <xbr t="Ex 39:32">32</xbr>, <xbr t="Ex 39:42-43">42–43</xbr>) for the concise inventory of all the parts included in that presentation to Moses. None of the individual parts listed, nor the sum of them, reflect just human ingenuity in designing something they wanted to have, but reflect instead just what their Lord required them to have. It was fully His architecture and His design at every level of the undertaking.</com>
<com id="com02039042"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 39:42-43">39:42–43</xbr></bcv> The double repetition of the same quality-control refrain found earlier in the chapter together with the 2 additional phrases emphasizing exact conformity (note “behold” and “just as”) to all specifications combine to formally mark the closing of these great God-initiated preparations for the place of His presence and the site of their worship. Israel’s skillful craftsmen had done their work with zero tolerance for error in mind!</com>
<com id="com02039043"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 39:43">39:43</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">Moses saw all the work.</b> Fittingly enough, the one who had been with God on the mount and had passed on to the people the blueprints for everything connected with Yahweh’s tabernacle personally inspected the work and confirmed its successful completion. The term “work” is to be taken as “the end result of professional and skilled craftsmen.” <b type="b_blue">Then Moses blessed them.</b> By this act, Moses set his final and formal seal of approval on the outcome of their earnestness and diligence, and expressed his prayer-wish that good would result to them from their God. This is the only instance recorded in Exodus of Moses’ pronouncing a blessing upon his people. The other appearances of the verb “to bless” occur 3 times with God as the subject of the verb (<xbr t="Ex 20:11">20:11</xbr>, <xbr t="Ex 20:24">24</xbr>; <xbr t="Ex 23:25">23:25</xbr>) and one time with Pharaoh requesting Moses to bless him (<xbr t="Ex 12:32">12:32</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02040001"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 40:1-33">40:1–33</xbr></bcv> Finally the time arrived for the tabernacle to be erected with the Holy of Holies and its accompanying Holy Place to the west, and the courtyard entrance to the east. In terms of pagan religions and their worship of the sun god, some polemic significance might be seen in the High Priest worshiping God with his back to the rising sun. All who entered the courtyard also turned their backs to the rising sun as they came in to sacrifice and worship.</com>
<com id="com02040017"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 40:17">40:17</xbr></bcv> The tabernacle was completed almost one year after the Exodus from Egypt. The people were at the foot of Mt. Sinai at that time, where the book of Leviticus was given in the first month of that second year. The record of Numbers begins with the people still at Mt. Sinai in the second month of that second year after leaving Egypt (cf. <xbr t="Nu 1:1">Nu 1:1</xbr>).</com>
<com id="com02040034"><bcv><xbr t="Ex 40:34">40:34</xbr></bcv> <b type="b_blue">the cloud covered … the glory of Yahweh filled.</b> This was the final confirmation for Moses and the people that all the work for setting up God’s dwelling place had been properly done and all the tedious instructions obediently followed.</com>
