    "content": "Introduction to the Pentateuch The first 5 books of the Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy) form a complete literary unit called the Pentateuch, meaning “five scrolls.” The five independent books of the Pentateuch were written as an unbroken unity in content and historical sequence, with each succeeding book beginning where the former left off. Genesis’ first words, “In the beginning God created.…” ( <a ref='Genesis 1:1'>Ge 1:1</a> ) imply the reality of God’s eternal or “before time” existence and announce the spectacular transition to time and space. While the exact date of creation cannot be determined, it certainly would be estimated to be thousands of years ago, not millions. Starting with Abraham (ca. 2165–1990 BC) in <a ref='Ge 11'>Ge 11</a> , this book of beginnings spans over 300 years to the death of Joseph in Egypt (ca. 1804 BC). There is then another gap of almost 300 years until the birth of Moses in Egypt (ca. 1525 BC; <a ref='Ex 2'>Ex 2</a> ). Exodus begins with the words “Now these are the names” ( <a ref='Exodus 1:1'>Ex 1:1</a> ), listing those of the family of Jacob who went down to Egypt to be with Joseph toward the end of Genesis ( <a ref='Ge 46'>Ge 46ff.</a> ). The second book of the Pentateuch, which records the escape of the Israelites from Egypt, concludes when the cloud which led the people through the wilderness descends upon the newly constructed tabernacle. The first Hebrew words of Leviticus may be translated, “Then Yahweh called to Moses” ( <a ref='Leviticus 1:1'>Lv 1:1</a> ). From the cloud of God’s Presence in the tabernacle of meeting ( <a ref='Leviticus 1:1'>Lv 1:1</a> ), God summons Moses in order to prescribe to him the ceremonial law which told Israel how they must approach their Holy Lord. Leviticus concludes with, “These are the commandments which Yahweh commanded Moses for the sons of Israel at Mount Sinai” ( <a ref='Leviticus 27:34'>Lv 27:34</a> ). Numbers, much like Leviticus, commences with God commissioning Moses at the tabernacle of meeting, this time to take a census in preparation for war against Israel’s enemies. The book’s title in the Hebrew Bible accurately represents the content—“Wilderness.” Due to lack of trust in God, Israel did not want to engage its enemies militarily in order to claim the Promised Land. After forty additional years in the wilderness for their rebellion, Israel arrived on the plains of Moab. Despite the fact that “It is eleven days’ <i>journey</i> from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea” ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:2'>Dt 1:2</a> ), the journey took Israel forty years due to their rebellion against God. Moses preached the book of Deuteronomy as a sermon on the Plains of Moab in preparation for God’s people to enter the land of covenant promise ( <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> ). The title Deuteronomy is from the Greek phrase <i>deuteros nomos</i> , meaning “second law.” The book focuses on the restatement and, to some extent, the reapplication of the law to Israel’s new circumstances. Moses was the human author of the Pentateuch ( <a ref='Exodus 17:14'>Ex 17:14</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 24:4'>24:4</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 33:1–2'>Nu 33:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:9'>Dt 31:9</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 1:8'>Jos 1:8</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 21:8'>2Ki 21:8</a> ); thus, another title for the collection is “The Books of Moses.” Through Moses, God revealed Himself, His former works, Israel’s family history, and its role in His plan of redemption for mankind. The Pentateuch is foundational to all the rest of Scripture. Quoted or alluded to thousands of times in the OT and in the NT, the Pentateuch was Israel’s first inspired body of Scripture. For many years, this alone was Israel’s Bible. Another common title for this section of Scripture is <i>Torah</i> or Law, nomenclature which looks at the didactic nature of these books. The Israelites were to meditate upon it ( <a ref='Joshua 1:8'>Jos 1:8</a> ), teach it to their children ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:4–8'>Dt 6:4–8</a> ), and read it publicly ( <a ref='Nehemiah 8:1'>Ne 8:1ff.</a> ). Just before his death and Israel’s move into the Promised Land, Moses set forth the process by which public reading would make its way into human hearts and change their relationship with God, and ultimately their conduct: Assemble the people, the men and the women and little ones and the sojourner who is within your gates, so that they may hear and so that they may learn and fear Yahweh your God and be careful to do all the words of this law. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:12'>Deuteronomy 31:12</a> The relationships between the commands are important. The people must: 1) gather to hear the law in order to learn what is required of them and what it has to say about God; 2) learn about the Lord in order to fear Him based on a correct understanding of who He is; and 3) fear God in order to be correctly motivated to obedience and good works. Good works performed for any other reason will be improperly motivated. The priests taught the law to the families ( <a ref='Malachi 2:4–7'>Mal 2:4–7</a> ), and the parents instructed the children within the home ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:4'>Dt 6:4ff.</a> ). Instruction in the law, in short, would provide the right foundation for the OT believer’s relationship with God. Because the Israelites’ knowledge of the world in which they lived came through the Egyptians, as well as their ancestors the Mesopotamians, there was much confusion about the creation of the world, how it got to its present state, and how Israel had come into existence. <a ref='Ge 1-11'>Ge 1–11</a> helped Israel understand the origin and nature of creation, human labor, sin, marriage, murder, death, bigamy, judgment, the multiplicity of languages, cultures, etc. These chapters established the worldview which explained the remainder of Israel’s first Bible, the Pentateuch. The later portion of Genesis explained to Israel who they were, including the purpose God had for them as a people. In <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> , God had appeared to Abraham and made a three-fold promise to give them a land, descendants, and blessing. Years later, in a ceremony typical to Abraham’s culture, God recast the three-fold promise into a covenant ( <a ref='Genesis 15:7'>Ge 15:7ff.</a> ). The remainder of Genesis treats the fulfillment of all three promises, but focuses especially on the seed or descendants. The barrenness of each of the patriarchs’ chosen wives taught Israel the importance of trust and patience in waiting for children from God. The rest of the Pentateuch looks at the way in which the promises of <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> expand in the Abrahamic Covenant and achieve their initial stages of fulfillment. Exodus and Leviticus focus more on the blessing of relationship with God. In Exodus, Israel meets the God of their fathers and is led forth by Him from Egypt to the Promised Land. Leviticus underscores the meticulous care with which the people and priests were to approach God in worship and every dimension of their lives. Holiness and cleanness come together in simple and practical ways. Numbers and Deuteronomy focus on the journey to and preparation for the Land. The Pentateuch treats many issues related to Israel’s relationship with their God. But the underlying theme of the Pentateuch is the initial, unfolding fulfillments of God’s promises made to Abraham.",

    "content": "Introduction to The Prophets The writing prophets of the OT fall into two groups: the 4 major prophets—Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel—and the 12 minor prophets—Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. Lamentations falls into the major-prophet grouping because of its connection with Jeremiah. Besides these, the OT regarded others as prophets. Such prophets as Gad, Nathan, Elijah, and Elisha were typical of the nonwriting prophets. In a sense, John the Baptist as a forerunner of Jesus was a prophet who belonged to the OT era. The following table gives the sequence and approximate dates and direction of ministry for the writing prophets, with “Israel” designating the northern kingdom and “Judah” the southern: Prophets Organized by Date and Direction of Ministry Prophet Ministered To In the Years Obadiah Edom 850–840 BC Joel Judah 835–796 BC Jonah Nineveh 784–760 BC Amos Israel 763–755 BC Hosea Israel 755–710 BC Isaiah Judah 739–680 BC Micah Judah 735–710 BC Nahum Nineveh 650–630 BC Zephaniah Judah 635–625 BC Jeremiah Judah 627–570 BC Habakkuk Judah 620–605 BC Daniel Babylon 605–536 BC Ezekiel Babylon 593–570 BC Haggai Judah 520–505 BC Zechariah Judah 520–470 BC Malachi Judah 437–417 BC Another way of categorizing the writing prophets relates them chronologically to the captivities of Israel (ca. 722 BC) and Judah (ca. 586 BC): Prophets Organized by Writing Date and Captivity Pre-Exilic Exilic Post-Exilic • Obadiah • Joel • Jonah • Amos • Hosea • Isaiah • Micah • Nahum • Zephaniah • Jeremiah • Habakkuk • Daniel • Ezekiel • Haggai • Zechariah • Malachi Messages of the writing prophets sometimes related to the prophets’ immediate future (e.g., <a ref='Isaiah 7:1–11'>Is 7:1–11</a> ) and sometimes to the distant future (e.g., <a ref='Isaiah 7:12–14'>Is 7:12–14</a> ). In their frequent predictions about the coming Messiah, they saw Him in two roles: that of a suffering Messiah (e.g., <a ref='Is 53'>Is 53</a> ) and that of a reigning Messiah (e.g., <a ref='Is 11'>Is 11</a> ). The prophets themselves were unable to comprehend completely how these two aspects of the Messiah’s future ministry would fit together ( <a ref='1 Peter 1:10–12'>1Pe 1:10–12</a> ). God’s dealings with Israel dominated the pages of the major and minor prophets, but several books—Daniel, Obadiah, Jonah, and Nahum—have as their subjects God’s working in Gentile world history. The other prophetic books look beyond Israel from time to time to note how God’s chosen nation will impact the rest of the nations (e.g., <a ref='Isaiah 52:10'>Is 52:10</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 52:15'>15</a> ) or how God will judge the nations. As seen from the chronological listing on the previous page, the period of the writing prophets ended about 400 years before the coming of Christ. No official declaration marked the end of OT prophecy, but the people of Israel came gradually to the realization that no prophet had appeared in Israel for a considerable period of time (cf. 1Macc 9:27). From the perspective of later times, it became obvious to all that the great prophetic movement of the OT terminated and thus commenced the 400 “silent years,” after which comparable written ministries of NT apostles and prophets began.",
