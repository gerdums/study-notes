    "content": "Introduction to The Bible The Bible is a collection of 66 documents inspired by God. These documents are gathered into two testaments, the Old (39) and the New (27). Prophets, priests, kings, and leaders from the nation of Israel wrote the OT books in Hebrew (with two passages in Aramaic). The apostles and their associates wrote the NT books in Greek. The OT record starts with the creation of the universe and closes about 400 years before the first coming of Jesus Christ. The flow of history through the OT moves along the following lines: • • Fall of man • • Judgment flood over the earth • • Abraham, Isaac, Jacob (Israel)—fathers of the chosen nation • • The history of Israel • • Creation of the universe The details of this history are explained in the 39 books divided into 5 categories: • • History—12 (Joshua–Esther) • • Wisdom—5 (Job–Song of Solomon) • • Major Prophets—5 (Isaiah–Daniel) • • The Law—5 (Genesis–Deuteronomy) • • Minor Prophets—12 (Hosea–Malachi) After the completion of the OT, there were 400 years of silence, during which no prophet spoke or wrote any Scripture. That silence was broken by the arrival of John the Baptist announcing that the promised Lord Savior had come. The NT records the rest of the story from the birth of Christ to the culmination of all history and the final eternal state; so the two testaments go from creation to consummation, eternity past to eternity future. While the 39 OT books major on the history of Israel and the promise of the coming Savior, the 27 NT books major on the person of Christ and the establishment of the church. The four Gospels give the record of his birth, life, death, resurrection, and ascension. Each of the four writers views the greatest and most important event of history, the coming of the God-man, Jesus Christ, from a different perspective. Matthew looks at him through the perspective of his kingdom; Mark through the perspective of his servanthood; Luke through the perspective of his humanness; and John through the perspective of his deity. The book of Acts tells the story of the impact of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Lord Savior—from his ascension, the consequent coming of the Holy Spirit, and the birth of the church, through the early years of gospel preaching by the apostles and their associates. Acts records the establishment of the church in Judea, Samaria, and into the Roman Empire. The 21 epistles were written to churches and individuals to explain the significance of the person and work of Jesus Christ, with its implications for life and witness until he returns. The NT closes with Revelation, which starts by picturing the current church age, and culminates with Christ’s return to establish his earthly kingdom, bringing judgment on the ungodly and glory and blessing for believers. Following the millennial reign of the Lord Savior will be the last judgment, leading to the eternal state. All believers of all history enter the ultimate eternal glory prepared for them, and all the ungodly are consigned to hell to be punished forever. To understand the Bible, it is essential to grasp the sweep of that history from creation to consummation. It is also crucial to keep in focus the unifying theme of Scripture. The one constant theme unfolding throughout the whole Bible is this: God for his own glory has chosen to create and gather to himself a group of people to be the subjects of his eternal kingdom, to praise, honor, and serve him forever and through whom he will display his wisdom, power, mercy, grace, and glory. To gather his chosen ones, God must redeem them from sin. The Bible reveals God’s plan for this redemption from its inception in eternity past to its completion in eternity future. Covenants, promises, and epochs are all secondary to the one continuous plan of redemption. There is one God. The Bible has one Creator. It is one book. It has one plan of grace, recorded from initiation, through execution, to consummation. From predestination to glorification, the Bible is the story of God redeeming his chosen people for the praise of his glory. As God’s redemptive purposes and plan unfold in Scripture, five recurring motifs are constantly emphasized: • • the judgment for sin and disobedience • • the blessing for faith and obedience • • the Lord Savior and sacrifice for sin • • the character of God • • the coming kingdom and glory Everything revealed on the pages of both the OT and NT is associated with those five categories. Scripture is always teaching or illustrating (1) the character and attributes of God; (2) the tragedy of sin and disobedience to God’s holy standard; (3) the blessedness of faith and obedience to God’s standard; (4) the need for a Savior by whose righteousness and substitution sinners can be forgiven, declared just, and transformed to obey God’s standard; and (5) the coming glorious end of redemptive history in the Lord Savior’s earthly kingdom and the subsequent eternal reign and glory of God and Christ. It is essential as one studies Scripture to grasp these recurring categories like great hooks on which to hang the passages. While reading through the Bible, one should be able to relate each portion of Scripture to these dominant topics, recognizing that what is introduced in the OT is also made more clear in the NT. Looking at these five categories separately gives an overview of the Bible. 1. The Revelation of the Character of God Above all else, Scripture is God’s self-revelation. He reveals himself as the sovereign God of the universe who has chosen to make man and to make himself known to man. In that self-revelation is established his standard of absolute holiness. From Adam and Eve through Cain and Abel and to everyone before and after the law of Moses, the standard of righteousness was established and is sustained to the last page of the NT. Violation of it produces judgment, temporal and eternal. In the OT, it is recorded that God revealed himself by the following means: • • angels • • signs, wonders, and miracles • • visions • • spoken words by prophets and others • • theophanies • • creation—primarily through man—who was made in his image • • written Scripture (OT) In the NT, it is recorded that God revealed himself again by the same means, but more clearly and fully: • • angels • • signs, wonders, and miracles • • visions • • spoken words by apostles and prophets • • written Scripture (NT) • • creation—the God-man, Jesus Christ, who was the very image of God 2. The Revelation of Divine Judgment for Sin and Disobedience Scripture repeatedly deals with the matter of man’s sin, which leads to divine judgment. Account after account in Scripture demonstrates the deadly effects in time and eternity of violating God’s standard. There are 1,189 chapters in the Bible. Only four of them don’t involve a fallen world: the first two and the last two—before the fall and after the creation of the new heaven and new earth. The rest is the chronicle of the tragedy of sin. In the OT, God showed the disaster of sin—starting with Adam and Eve, to Cain and Abel, the patriarchs, Moses and Israel, the kings, priests, some prophets, and Gentile nations. Throughout the OT is the relentless record of continual devastation produced by sin and disobedience to God’s law. In the NT, the tragedy of sin becomes more clear. The preaching and teaching of Jesus and the apostles begin and end with a call to repentance. King Herod, the Jewish leaders, and the nation of Israel—along with Pilate, Rome, and the rest of the world—all reject the Lord Savior, spurn the truth of God, and thus condemn themselves. The chronicle of sin continues unabated to the end of the age and the return of Christ in judgment. In the NT, disobedience is even more flagrant than OT disobedience because it involves the rejection of the Lord Savior Jesus Christ in the brighter light of NT truth. 3. The Revelation of Divine Blessing for Faith and Obedience Scripture repeatedly promises wonderful rewards in time and eternity that come to people who trust God and seek to obey him. In the OT, God showed the blessedness of repentance from sin, faith in himself, and obedience to his Word—from Abel, through the patriarchs, to the remnant in Israel—and even Gentiles who believed (such as the people of Nineveh). God’s standard for humankind, his will, and his moral law were always made known. To those who faced their inability to keep God’s standard, recognized their sin, confessed their impotence to please God by their own effort and works, and asked him for forgiveness and grace—there came merciful redemption and blessing for time and eternity. In the NT, God again showed the full blessedness of redemption from sin for repentant people. There were those who responded to the preaching of repentance by John the Baptist. Others repented at the preaching of Jesus. Still others from Israel obeyed the gospel through the apostles’ preaching. And finally, there were Gentiles all over the Roman Empire who believed the gospel. To all those and to all who will believe through all of history, there is blessing promised in this world and the world to come. 4. The Revelation of the Lord Savior and Sacrifice for Sin This is the heart of both the OT, which Jesus said spoke of him in type and prophecy, and the NT, which gives the biblical record of his coming. The promise of blessing is dependent on grace and mercy given to the sinner. Grace means that sin is not held against the sinner. Such forgiveness is dependent on a payment of sin’s penalty to satisfy holy justice. That requires a substitute—one to die in the sinner’s place. God’s chosen substitute—the only one who qualified—was Jesus. Salvation is always by the same gracious means, whether during OT or NT times. When any sinner comes to God, repentant and convinced he has no power to save himself from the deserved judgment of divine wrath, and pleads for mercy, God’s promise of forgiveness is granted. God then declares him righteous because the sacrifice and obedience of Christ is put to his account. In the OT, God justified sinners that same way, in anticipation of Christ’s atoning work. There is, therefore, a continuity of grace and salvation through all of redemptive history. Various covenants, promises, and epochs do not alter that fundamental continuity, nor does the discontinuity between the OT witness nation, Israel, and the NT witness people, the church. A fundamental continuity is centered in the cross, which was no interruption in the plan of God, but is the very thing to which all else points. Throughout the OT, the Savior and sacrifice are promised. In Genesis, he is the seed of the woman who will destroy Satan. In Zechariah, he is the pierced one to whom Israel turns and by whom God opens the fountain of forgiveness to all who mourn over their sin. He is the very One symbolized in the sacrificial system of the Mosaic law. He is the suffering substitute spoken of by the prophets. Throughout the OT, he is the Messiah who would die for the transgressions of his people; from beginning to end in the OT, the theme of the Lord Savior as a sacrifice for sin is presented. It is solely because of his perfect sacrifice for sin that God graciously forgives repentant believers. In the NT, the Lord Savior came and actually provided the promised sacrifice for sin on the cross. Having fulfilled all righteousness by his perfect life, he fulfilled justice by his death. Thus God himself atoned for sin, at a cost too great for the human mind to fathom. Now he graciously supplies on their behalf all the merit necessary for his people to be the objects of his favor. That is what Scripture means when it speaks of salvation by grace. 5. The Revelation of the Kingdom and Glory of the Lord Savior This crucial component of Scripture brings the whole story to its God-ordained consummation. Redemptive history is controlled by God, so as to culminate in his eternal glory. Redemptive history will end with the same precision and exactness with which it began. The truths of eschatology are neither vague nor unclear—nor are they unimportant. As in any book, how the story ends is the most crucial and compelling part—so with the Bible. Scripture notes several very specific features of the end planned by God. In the OT, there is repeated mention of an earthly kingdom ruled by the Messiah, Lord Savior, who will come to reign. Associated with that kingdom will be the salvation of Israel, the salvation of Gentiles, the renewal of the earth from the effects of the curse, and the bodily resurrection of God’s people who have died. Finally, the OT predicts that there will be the “uncreation” or dissolution of the universe, and the creation of a new heaven and new earth—which will be the eternal state of the godly—and a final hell for the ungodly. In the NT, these features are clarified and expanded. The King was rejected and executed, but he promised to come back in glory, bringing judgment, resurrection, and his kingdom for all who believe. Innumerable Gentiles from every nation will be included among the redeemed. Israel will be saved and grafted back into the root of blessing from which the nation had been temporarily excised. Israel’s promised kingdom will be enjoyed, with the Lord Savior reigning on the throne, in the renewed earth, exercising power over the whole world, having taken back his rightful authority, and receiving due honor and worship. Following that kingdom will come the dissolution of the renewed, but still sin-stained creation, and the subsequent creation of a new heaven and new earth—which will be the eternal state, separate forever from the ungodly in hell. Those are the five topics that fill up the Bible. To understand them at the start is to know the answer to the question that continually arises—Why does the Bible tell us this? Everything fits into this glorious pattern. As you read, hang the truth on these five hooks and the Bible will unfold, not as 66 separate documents, or even two separate testaments—but one book, by one divine Author, who wrote it all with one overarching theme. My prayer is that the magnificent and overwhelming theme of the redemption of sinners for the glory of God will carry every reader with captivating interest from beginning to end of the story. Christian—this is your story. It is from God for you—about you. It tells what he planned for you, why he made you, what you were, what you have become in Christ, and what he has prepared for you in eternal glory. John MacArthur",

    "content": "How We Got The Bible Ever since Eve encountered Satan’s barrage of doubt and denial ( <a ref='Genesis 3:1–7'>Gen. 3:1–7</a> ), humankind has continued to question God’s Word. Unfortunately, Eve had little or no help in sorting through her intellectual obstacles to full faith in God’s self-disclosure ( <a ref='Genesis 2:16'>Gen. 2:16</a> , <a ref='Genesis 2:17'>17</a> ). Now the Scripture certainly has more than enough content to be interrogated, considering that it’s comprised of 66 books, 1,189 chapters, 31,173 verses, and 757,444 words. When you open your English translation to read or study, you might have asked in the past or are currently asking, “How can I be sure this is the pure and true Word of God?” A question of this kind is not altogether bad, especially when one seeks to learn with a teachable mind ( <a ref='Acts 17:11'>Acts 17:11</a> ). The Scripture invites the kinds of queries that a sincere student asks. A whole host of questions can flood the mind, such as the following: • • Whose thinking does it reflect? • • Did any books of the Bible get lost in time past? • • What does the Scripture claim for itself? • • Does it live up to its claims? • • Who wrote the Bible—God or man? • • Has Scripture been protected from human tampering over the centuries? • • How close to the original manuscripts are today’s translations? • • How did the Bible get to our time and in our language? • • Is there more Scripture to come, beyond the current 66 books? • • Who determined, and on what basis, that the Bible would be composed of the traditional list of 66 books? • • If the Scriptures were written over a period of 1,500 years (c. 1405 bc to ad 95), passed down since then for almost 2,000 years, and translated into several thousand languages, what prevented the Bible from being changed by the carelessness or ill motives of men? • • Where did the Bible come from? • • Does today’s Bible really deserve the title “The Word of God”? Undoubtedly, these questions have bombarded the minds of many. A study of the Scriptures alone settles all questions to the extent that there is no need to be bothered by them again. Scripture gives this assurance. Scripture’s Self-Claims Take the Bible and let it speak for itself. Does it claim to be God’s Word? Yes! Over 2,000 times in the Old Testament alone, the Bible asserts that God spoke what is written within its pages. From the beginning ( <a ref='Genesis 1:3'>Gen. 1:3</a> ) to the end ( <a ref='Malachi 4:3'>Mal. 4:3</a> ) and continually throughout, this is what Scripture claims. The phrase “the word of God” occurs 40 times in the New Testament. It is equated with the Old Testament ( <a ref='Mark 7:13'>Mark 7:13</a> ). It is what Jesus preached ( <a ref='Luke 5:1'>Luke 5:1</a> ). It was the message the apostles taught ( <a ref='Acts 4:31'>Acts 4:31</a> ; <a ref='Acts 6:2'>6:2</a> ). It was the word the Samaritans received ( <a ref='Acts 8:14'>Acts 8:14</a> ) as given by the apostles ( <a ref='Acts 8:25'>Acts 8:25</a> ). It was the message the Gentiles received as preached by Peter ( <a ref='Acts 11:1'>Acts 11:1</a> ). It was the word Paul preached on his first missionary journey ( <a ref='Acts 13:5'>Acts 13:5</a> , <a ref='Acts 13:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Acts 13:44'>44</a> , <a ref='Acts 13:48–49'>48–49</a> ; <a ref='Acts 15:35–36'>15:35–36</a> ). It was the message preached on Paul’s second missionary journey ( <a ref='Acts 16:32'>Acts 16:32</a> ; <a ref='Acts 17:13'>17:13</a> ; <a ref='Acts 18:11'>18:11</a> ). It was the message Paul preached on his third missionary journey ( <a ref='Acts 19:10'>Acts 19:10</a> ). It was the focus of Luke in the book of Acts in that it spread rapidly and widely ( <a ref='Acts 6:7'>Acts 6:7</a> ; <a ref='Acts 12:24'>12:24</a> ; <a ref='Acts 19:20'>19:20</a> ). Paul was careful to tell the Corinthians that he spoke the word as it was given from God, that it had not been adulterated, and that it was a manifestation of truth ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 2:17'>2 Cor. 2:17</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:2'>4:2</a> ). Paul acknowledged that it was the source of his preaching ( <a ref='Colossians 1:25'>Col. 1:25</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 2:13'>1 Thess. 2:13</a> ). <a ref='Ps 19'>Psalms 19</a> and <a ref='Ps 119'>119</a> , plus <a ref='Proverbs 30:5–6'>Proverbs 30:5–6</a> , make powerful statements about God’s word that set it apart from any other religious instruction ever known in the history of humankind. These passages make the case for the Bible being called “sacred” ( <a ref='2 Timothy 3:15'>2 Tim. 3:15</a> ) and “holy” ( <a ref='Romans 1:2'>Rom. 1:2</a> ). The Bible claims ultimate spiritual authority in doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness because it represents the inspired word of Almighty God ( <a ref='2 Timothy 3:16–17'>2 Tim. 3:16–17</a> ). Scripture asserts its spiritual sufficiency, so much so that it claims exclusivity for its teaching (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 55:11'>Isa. 55:11</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 1:3–4'>2 Pet. 1:3–4</a> ). God’s Word declares that it is <i>inerrant</i> ( <a ref='Psalms 12:6'>Ps. 12:6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 119:140'>119:140</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 30:5'>Prov. 30:5a</a> ; <a ref='John 10:35'>John 10:35</a> ) and <i>infallible</i> ( <a ref='2 Timothy 3:16–17'>2 Tim. 3:16–17</a> ). In other words, it is true and therefore trustworthy. All of these qualities are dependent on the fact that Scripture is God-given ( <a ref='2 Timothy 3:16'>2 Tim. 3:16</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 1:20–21'>2 Pet. 1:20–21</a> ), which guarantees its quality at the Source and at its original writing. In Scripture, the person of God and the Word of God are everywhere interrelated, so much so that whatever is true about the character of God is true about the nature of God’s Word. God is true, impeccable, and reliable; therefore, so is his Word. What a person thinks about God’s Word, in reality, reflects what a person thinks about God. Thus, the Scripture can make these demands on its readers. <i>And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.</i> <i><a ref='Deuteronomy 8:3'>Deuteronomy 8:3</a></i> <i>I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my portion of food.</i> <i><a ref='Job 23:12'>Job 23:12</a></i> The Publishing Process The Bible does not expect its reader to speculate on how these divine qualities were transferred from God to his Word, but rather anticipates the questions with convincing answers. Every generation of skeptics has assailed the self-claims of the Bible, but its own explanations and answers have been more than equal to the challenge. The Bible has gone through God’s publishing process in being given to and distributed among the human race. Its several features are discussed below. Revelation God took the initiative to disclose or reveal himself to humankind ( <a ref='Hebrews 1:1'>Heb. 1:1</a> ). The vehicles varied; sometimes it was through the created order, at other times through visions/dreams or speaking prophets. However, the most complete and understandable self-disclosures were through the propositions of Scripture ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:6–16'>1 Cor. 2:6–16</a> ). The revealed and written Word of God is unique in that it is the only revelation of God that is complete and that so clearly declares humanity’s sinfulness and God’s provision of the Savior. Inspiration The revelation of God was captured in the writings of Scripture by means of “inspiration.” This has more to do with the process by which God revealed himself than the fact of his self-revelation. “All Scripture is breathed out by God” ( <a ref='2 Timothy 3:16'>2 Tim. 3:16</a> ) makes the claim. Peter explains the process: “No prophecy of Scripture comes from someone’s own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit” ( <a ref='2 Peter 1:20–21'>2 Pet. 1:20–21</a> ). By this means, the Word of God was protected from human error in its original record by the ministry of the Holy Spirit (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:18'>Deut. 18:18</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 1:22'>Matt. 1:22</a> ). A section of <a ref='Zechariah 7:12'>Zech. 7:12</a> describes it most clearly: “The law and the words that the Lord of hosts had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets.” This ministry of the Spirit extended to both the part (the words) and to the whole in the original writings. Canonicity We must understand that the Bible is actually one book with one Divine Author, though it was written over a period of 1,500 years through the pens of almost 40 human writers. The Bible began with the creation account of <a ref='Ge 1-2'>Genesis 1–2</a> , written by Moses about 1405 bc , and extends to the eternity future account of <a ref='Rev 21-22'>Revelation 21–22</a> , written by the Apostle John about ad 95. During this time, God progressively revealed himself and his purposes in the inspired Scriptures. But this raises a significant question: “How do we know what supposed sacred writings were to be included in the canon of Scripture and which ones were to be excluded?” Over the centuries, three widely recognized principles were used to validate those writings that came as a result of divine revelation and inspiration. First, the writing had to have a recognized prophet or apostle as its author (or one associated with them, as in the case of Mark, Luke, Hebrews, James, and Jude). Second, the writing could not disagree with or contradict previous Scripture. Third, the writing had to have general consensus by the church as an inspired book. Thus, when various councils met in church history to consider the canon, they did not vote for the canonicity of a book but rather recognized, after the fact, what God had already written. With regard to the Old Testament, by the time of Christ all of the Old Testament had been written and accepted in the Jewish community. The last book, Malachi, had been completed about 430 bc . Not only does the Old Testament canon of Christ’s day conform to the Old Testament that has since been used throughout the centuries, but it does not contain the uninspired and spurious Apocrypha, that group of 14 rogue writings that were written after Malachi and attached to the Old Testament about 200–150 bc in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament called the Septuagint (LXX), appearing to this very day in some versions of the Bible. However, not one passage from the Apocrypha is cited by any New Testament writer, nor did Jesus affirm any of it as he recognized the Old Testament canon of his era (cf. <a ref='Luke 24:27'>Luke 24:27</a> , <a ref='Luke 24:44'>44</a> ). By Christ’s time, the Old Testament canon had been divided up into two lists of 22 or 24 books respectively, each of which contained all the same material as the 39 books of our modern versions. In the 22-book canon, Jeremiah and Lamentations were considered as one, as were Judges and Ruth. Here is how the 24-book format was divided. The Hebrew Old Testament Law | Prophets | Writings 1. Genesis | A. Former Prophets | A. Poetical Books | A. Former Prophets | A. Poetical Books | 1. Genesis 2. Exodus | 6. Joshua | 14. Psalms | 2. Exodus | 6. Joshua | 14. Psalms 3. Leviticus | 7. Judges | 15. Proverbs | 3. Leviticus | 7. Judges | 15. Proverbs 4. Numbers | 8. Samuel (1 & 2) | 16. Job | 4. Numbers | 8. Samuel (1 & 2) | 16. Job 5. Deuteronomy | 9. Kings (1 & 2) | B. Five Rolls (Megilloth) | B. Five Rolls (Megilloth) | 5. Deuteronomy | 9. Kings (1 & 2) B. Latter Prophets | 17. Song of Solomon | B. Latter Prophets | 17. Song of Solomon 10. Isaiah | 18. Ruth | 10. Isaiah | 18. Ruth 11. Jeremiah | 19. Lamentations | 11. Jeremiah | 19. Lamentations 12. Ezekiel | 20. Ecclesiastes | 12. Ezekiel | 20. Ecclesiastes 13. The Twelve (minor prophets) | 21. Esther | 13. The Twelve (minor prophets) | 21. Esther C. Historical Books | C. Historical Books 22. Daniel | 22. Daniel 23. Ezra-Nehemiah | 23. Ezra-Nehemiah 24. Chronicles (1 & 2) | 24. Chronicles (1 & 2) The same three key tests of canonicity that applied to the Old Testament also applied to the New Testament. In the case of Mark and Luke/Acts, the authors were considered to be, in effect, the penmen for Peter and Paul, respectively. James and Jude were written by Christ’s half brothers. While Hebrews is the only New Testament book whose authorship is unknown for certain, its content is so in line with both the Old Testament and New Testament that the early church concluded it must have been written by an apostolic associate. The 27 books of the New Testament have been universally accepted since c. ad 350–400 as inspired by God. Preservation How can one be sure that the revealed and inspired, written Word of God, which was recognized as canonical by the early church, has been handed down to this day without any loss of material? Furthermore, since one of the Devil’s prime concerns is to undermine the Bible, have the Scriptures survived this destructive onslaught? In the beginning, he denied God’s Word to Eve ( <a ref='Genesis 3:4'>Gen. 3:4</a> ). Satan later attempted to distort the Scripture in his wilderness encounter with Christ ( <a ref='Matthew 4:6–7'>Matt. 4:6–7</a> ). Through King Jehoiakim, he even attempted to literally destroy the Word ( <a ref='Jeremiah 36:23'>Jer. 36:23</a> ). The battle for the Bible rages, but Scripture has and will continue to outlast its enemies. God anticipated humanity’s and Satan’s malice toward the Scripture with divine promises to preserve his Word. The very continued existence of Scripture is guaranteed in <a ref='Isaiah 40:8'>Isaiah 40:8</a> , “The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever” (cf. <a ref='1 Peter 1:25'>1 Pet. 1:25</a> ). This even means that no inspired Scripture has been lost in the past and still awaits rediscovery. The actual content of Scripture will be perpetuated, both in heaven ( <a ref='Psalms 119:89'>Ps. 119:89</a> ) and on earth ( <a ref='Isaiah 59:21'>Isa. 59:21</a> ). Thus the purposes of God, as published in the sacred writings, will never be thwarted, even in the least detail (cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:18'>Matt. 5:18</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:25'>24:25</a> ; <a ref='Mark 13:31'>Mark 13:31</a> ; <a ref='Luke 16:17'>Luke 16:17</a> ). <i>So shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.</i> <i><a ref='Isaiah 55:11'>Isaiah 55:11</a></i> Transmission Since the Bible has frequently been translated into multiple languages and distributed throughout the world, how can we be sure that error has not crept in, even if it was unintentional? As Christianity spread, it is certainly true that people desired to have the Bible in their own language, which required translations from the original Hebrew and Aramaic languages of the Old Testament and the Greek of the New Testament. Not only did the work of translators provide an opportunity for error, but publication, which was done by hand copying until the printing press arrived c. ad 1450, also afforded continual possibilities of error. Through the centuries, the practitioners of textual criticism, a precise science, have discovered, preserved, catalogued, evaluated, and published an amazing array of biblical manuscripts from both the Old and New Testaments. In fact, the number of existing biblical manuscripts dramatically outdistances the existing fragments of any other ancient literature. By comparing text with text, the textual critic can confidently determine what the original prophetic/apostolic, inspired writing contained. Although existing copies of the main, ancient Hebrew text (Masoretic) date back only to the tenth century ad , two other important lines of textual evidence bolster the confidence of textual critics that they have reclaimed the originals. First, the tenth-century ad Hebrew Old Testament can be compared to the Greek translation called the Septuagint or LXX (written c. 200–150 bc ; the oldest existing manuscripts date to c. ad 325). There is amazing consistency between the two, which speaks of the accuracy in copying the Hebrew text for centuries. Second, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947–1956 (manuscripts that are dated c. 200–100 bc ) proved to be monumentally important. After comparing the earlier Hebrew texts with the later ones, only a few slight variants were discovered, none of which changed the meaning of any passage. Although the Old Testament had been translated and copied for centuries, the latest version was essentially the same as the earlier ones. The New Testament findings are even more decisive because a much larger amount of material is available for study; there are over 5,000 Greek New Testament manuscripts that range from the whole testament to scraps of papyri which contain as little as part of one verse. A few existing fragments date back to within 25–50 years of the original writing. New Testament textual scholars have generally concluded that (1) 99.99 percent of the original writings have been reclaimed, and (2) of the remaining one hundredth of one percent, there are no variants substantially affecting any Christian doctrine. With this wealth of biblical manuscripts in the original languages and with the disciplined activity of textual critics to establish with almost perfect accuracy the content of the autographs, any errors that have been introduced and/or perpetuated by the thousands of translations over the centuries can be identified and corrected by comparing the translation or copy with the reassembled original. By this providential means, God has made good his promise to preserve the Scriptures. We can rest assured that there are translations available today that indeed are worthy of the title, The Word of God. The history of a full, English translation Bible essentially began with John Wycliffe (c. ad 1330–1384), who made the first English translation of the whole Bible. Later, William Tyndale was associated with the first complete, printed New Testament in English, c. ad 1526. Myles Coverdale followed in ad 1535 by delivering the first complete Bible printed in English. By ad 1611, the King James Version ( kjv ) had been completed. Since then, hundreds of translations have been made. Summing It Up God intended his Word to abide forever (preservation). Therefore his written, propositional, self disclosure (revelation) was protected from error in its original writing (inspiration) and collected in 66 books of the Old and New Testaments (canonicity). Through the centuries, tens of thousands of copies and thousands of translations have been made (transmission), which did introduce some error. Because there is an abundance of existing ancient Old Testament and New Testament manuscripts, however, the exacting science of textual criticism has been able to reclaim the content of the original writings (revelation and inspiration) to the extreme degree of 99.99 percent, with the remaining one hundredth of one percent having no effect on its content (preservation). The sacred book that we read, study, obey, and preach deserves to unreservedly be called The Bible or “The Book without peer,” since its author is God and it bears the qualities of total truth and complete trustworthiness, as also characterizes its divine source. Is There More to Come? How do we know that God will not amend our current Bible with a 67th inspired book? Or, in other words, “Is the canon forever closed?” Scripture texts warn that no one should delete from or add to Scripture ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:2'>Deut. 4:2</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:32'>12:32</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 30:6'>Prov. 30:6</a> ). Realizing that additional canonical books actually came after these words of warning, we can only conclude that while no deletions whatsoever were permitted, in fact, authorized, inspired writings were permitted to be added in order to complete the canon protected by those passages. The most compelling text on the closed canon is the Scripture to which nothing has been added for 1,900 years. <i>I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.</i> <i><a ref='Revelation 22:18–19'>Revelation 22:18–19</a></i> Several significant observations, when taken together, have convinced the church over the centuries that the canon of Scripture is actually closed, never to be reopened. So we can conclude, based on solid biblical reasoning, that the canon is and will remain closed. There will be no future 67th book of the Bible. Where Do We Stand? In April, 1521, Martin Luther appeared before his ecclesiastical accusers at the Diet of Worms. They had given him the ultimatum to repudiate his unwavering faith in the sufficiency and perspicuity of the Scriptures. Luther is said to have responded, “Unless I am convicted by Scripture and plain reason—I do not accept the authority of popes and councils, for they have contradicted each other—my conscience is captive to the Word of God. . . . God help me! Here I stand.” Like Martin Luther, may we rise above the doubts within and confront the threats without when God’s Word is assailed. God help us to be loyal contenders of the faith. Let us stand with God and the Scripture alone—for this book contains the mind of God, the state of man, the way of salvation, the doom of sinners, and the happiness of believers. Its doctrine is holy, its precepts are binding, its histories are true, and its decisions are immutable. Read it to be wise, believe it to be saved, and practice it to be holy. It contains light to direct you, food to support you, and comfort to cheer you. It is the traveler’s map, the pilgrim’s staff, the pilot’s compass, the soldier’s sword, and the Christian’s charter. Here heaven is open, and the gates of hell are disclosed. Christ is the grand subject, our good its design, and the glory of God its end. It should fill the memory, rule the heart, and guide the feet. Read it slowly, frequently, and prayerfully. It is a mine of wealth, health to the soul, and a river of pleasure. It is given to you here in this life, will be opened at the judgment, and is established forever. It involves the highest responsibility, will reward the greatest labor, and condemn all who trifle with its contents. <i>And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.</i> <i><a ref='1 Thessalonians 2:13'>1 Thessalonians 2:13</a></i>",

    "content": "How to Study The Bible Here are tips on how to get the most out of the study of this “divine handbook.” These pointers will help answer the most crucial question of all, “How can a young man keep his way pure?” The psalmist responds, “By guarding it according to your word” ( <a ref='Psalms 119:9'>Ps. 119:9</a> ). Why Is It Important to Study the Bible? Why is God’s Word so important? Because it contains God’s mind and will for your life ( <a ref='2 Timothy 3:16–17'>2 Tim. 3:16–17</a> ). It is the only source of absolute divine authority for you as a servant of Jesus Christ. How Will I Benefit from Studying the Bible? Millions of pages of material are printed every week. Thousands of new books are published each month. This would not be surprising to Solomon, who said, “Beware of anything beyond these. Of making many books there is no end” ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:12'>Eccles. 12:12</a> ). Even with today’s wealth of books and computer helps, the Bible remains the only source of divine revelation and power that can sustain Christians in their “daily walk with God.” Note these significant promises in the Scripture. What Should Be My Response to the Bible? Because the Bible is so important and because it provides unparalleled eternal benefits, then these should be your responses: • • Honor it ( <a ref='Job 23:12'>Job 23:12</a> ) • • Love it ( <a ref='Psalms 119:97'>Ps. 119:97</a> ) • • Obey it ( <a ref='1 John 2:5'>1 John 2:5</a> ) • • Guard it ( <a ref='1 Timothy 6:20'>1 Tim. 6:20</a> ) • • Fight for it ( <a ref='Jude 1:3'>Jude 3</a> ) • • Preach it ( <a ref='2 Timothy 4:2'>2 Tim. 4:2</a> ) • • Study it ( <a ref='Ezra 7:10'>Ezra 7:10</a> ) • • Believe it ( <a ref='John 6:68–69'>John 6:68–69</a> ) Who Can Study the Bible? Not everyone can be a Bible student. Check yourself on these necessary qualifications for studying the Word with blessing: • • Are you hungering for God’s Word ( <a ref='1 Peter 2:2'>1 Pet. 2:2</a> )? • • Are you searching God’s Word with diligence ( <a ref='Acts 17:11'>Acts 17:11</a> )? • • Are you seeking holiness ( <a ref='1 Peter 1:14–16'>1 Pet. 1:14–16</a> )? • • Are you saved by faith in Jesus Christ ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:14–16'>1 Cor. 2:14–16</a> )? • • Are you Spirit-filled ( <a ref='Ephesians 5:18'>Eph. 5:18</a> )? The most important question is the first. If you have never invited Jesus Christ to be your personal Savior and the Lord of your life, then your mind is blinded by Satan to God’s truth ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:4'>2 Cor. 4:4</a> ). If Christ is your need, stop reading right now and, in your own words with prayer, turn away from sin and turn toward God: “For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast” ( <a ref='Ephesians 2:8–9'>Eph. 2:8–9</a> ). What Are the Basics of Bible Study? Personal Bible study, in precept, is simple. I want to share with you five steps to Bible study that will give you a pattern to follow. STEP 1—Reading Read a passage of Scripture repeatedly until you understand its theme, meaning the main truth of the passage. Isaiah said, “To whom will he teach knowledge, and to whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, those taken from the breast? For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little” ( <a ref='Isaiah 28:9–10'>Isa. 28:9–10</a> ). Develop a plan on how you will approach reading through the Bible. You will probably not read it straight through from cover to cover, like you would for most books. There are many good Bible reading plans available, but here is one that I have found helpful. Read through the Old Testament at least once a year. As you read, note in the margins any truths you particularly want to remember, and write down separately anything you do not immediately understand. Often as you read you will find that many questions are answered by the text itself. The questions to which you cannot find answers become the starting points for more in-depth study using commentaries or other reference tools. Follow a different plan for reading the New Testament. Read one book at a time repetitiously for a month or more. This will help you to retain what is in the New Testament and not always have to depend on a concordance to find things. If you want to try this, begin with a short book, such as 1 John, and read it through in one sitting every day for 30 days. At the end of that time, you will know what is in the book. Write on index cards the major theme of each chapter. By referring to the cards as you do your daily reading, you will begin to remember the content of each chapter. In fact, you will develop a visual perception of the book in your mind. Divide longer books into short sections and read each section daily for 30 days. For example, the Gospel of John contains 21 chapters. Divide it into three sections of seven chapters. At the end of 90 days, you will finish John. For variety, alternate short and long books, and in less than three years you will have finished the entire New Testament—and you will really know it! STEP 2—Interpreting In <a ref='Acts 8:30'>Acts 8:30</a> , Philip asked the Ethiopian eunuch, “Do you understand what you are reading?” Or put another way, “What does the Bible mean by what it says?” It is not enough to read the text and jump directly to the application. We must first determine what it means; otherwise the application may be incorrect. As you read Scripture, always keep in mind one simple question: “What does this mean?” To answer that question requires the use of the most basic principle of interpretation, called the analogy of faith, which tells the reader to “interpret the Bible with the Bible.” Letting the Holy Spirit be your teacher ( <a ref='1 John 2:27'>1 John 2:27</a> ), search the Scripture he has authored, using cross-references, comparative passages, concordances, indexes, and other helps. For those passages that yet remain unclear, consult your pastor or godly men who have written in that particular area. Errors to Avoid As you interpret Scripture, several common errors should be avoided. Gaps to Bridge The books of the Bible were written many centuries ago. For us to understand today what God was communicating then, there are several gaps that need to be bridged: the language gap, the cultural gap, the geographical gap, and the historical gap. Proper interpretation, therefore, takes time and disciplined effort. Principles to Understand Four principles should guide us as we interpret the Bible: literal, historical, grammatical, and synthesis. STEP 3—Evaluating You have been reading and asking the question, “What does the Bible say?” Then you have interpreted, asking the question, “What does the Bible mean?” Now it is time to consult others to insure that you have the proper interpretation. Remember, the Bible will never contradict itself. Read Bible introductions, commentaries, and background books that will enrich your thinking through that illumination that God has given to other men and to you through their books. In your evaluation, be a true seeker. Be one who accepts the truth of God’s Word even though it may cause you to change what you always have believed, or cause you to alter your life pattern. STEP 4—Applying. The next question is this: “How does God’s truth penetrate and change my own life?” Studying Scripture without allowing it to penetrate to the depths of your soul would be like preparing a banquet without eating it. The bottom-line question to ask is, “How do the divine truths and principles contained in any passage apply to me in terms of my attitude and actions?” Jesus made this promise to those who would carry their personal Bible study through to this point: “If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them” ( <a ref='John 13:17'>John 13:17</a> ). Having read and interpreted the Bible, you should have a basic understanding of what the Bible says, and what it means by what it says. But studying the Bible does not stop there. The ultimate goal should be to let it speak to you and enable you to grow spiritually. That requires personal application. Bible study is not complete until we ask ourselves, “What does this mean for my life, and how can I practically apply it?” We must take the knowledge we have gained from our reading and interpretation and draw out the practical principles that apply to our personal lives. If there is a command to be obeyed, we obey it. If there is a promise to be embraced, we claim it. If there is a warning to be followed, we heed it. This is the ultimate step: we submit to Scripture and let it transform our lives. If you skip this step, you will never enjoy your Bible study and the Bible will never change your life. STEP 5—Correlating. This last stage connects the doctrine you have learned in a particular passage or book with divine truths and principles taught elsewhere in the Bible to form the big picture. Always keep in mind that the Bible is one book in 66 parts, and it contains a number of truths and principles, taught over and over again in a variety of ways and circumstances. By correlating and cross-referencing, you will begin to build a sound doctrinal foundation by which to live. What Now? The psalmist said, “Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the Lord , and on his law he meditates day and night” ( <a ref='Psalms 1:1–2'>Ps. 1:1–2</a> ). It is not enough just to study the Bible. We must meditate upon it. In a very real sense we are giving our brain a bath; we are washing it in the purifying solution of God’s Word. <i>This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.</i> <i><a ref='Joshua 1:8'>Joshua 1:8</a></i> Here is the spring where waters flow, To quench our heat of sin: Here is the tree where truth doth grow, To lead our lives therein: Here is the judge that stints the strife, When men’s devices fail: Here is the bread that feeds the life That death cannot assail. The tidings of salvation dear, Comes to our ears from hence: The fortress of our faith is here, And shield of our defense. Then be not like the swine that hath A pearl at his desire, And takes more pleasure from the trough And wallowing in the mire. Read not this book in any case, But with a single eye: Read not but first desire God’s grace, To understand thereby. Pray still in faith with this respect, To bear good fruit therein, That knowledge may bring this effect, To mortify your sin. Then happy you shall be in all your life, What so to you befalls: Yes, double happy you shall be, When God by death you calls. (From the first Bible printed in Scotland—1576)",

    "content": "Preface to the English Standard Version® The Bible “This Book [is] the most valuable thing that this world affords. Here is Wisdom; this is the royal Law; these are the lively Oracles of God.” With these words the Moderator of the Church of Scotland hands a Bible to the new monarch in Britain’s coronation service. These words echo the King James Bible translators, who wrote in 1611, “God’s sacred Word . . . is that inestimable treasure that excelleth all the riches of the earth.” This assessment of the Bible is the motivating force behind the publication of the English Standard Version. Translation Legacy The English Standard Version ( esv ) stands in the classic mainstream of English Bible translations over the past half-millennium. The fountainhead of that stream was William Tyndale’s New Testament of 1526; marking its course were the King James Version of 1611 (KJV), the English Revised Version of 1885 (RV), the American Standard Version of 1901 (ASV), and the Revised Standard Version of 1952 and 1971 (RSV). In that stream, faithfulness to the text and vigorous pursuit of precision were combined with simplicity, beauty, and dignity of expression. Our goal has been to carry forward this legacy for this generation and generations to come. To this end each word and phrase in the ESV has been carefully weighed against the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, to ensure the fullest accuracy and clarity and to avoid under-translating or overlooking any nuance of the original text. The words and phrases themselves grow out of the Tyndale-King James legacy, and most recently out of the RSV, with the 1971 RSV text providing the starting point for our work. Archaic language has been brought into line with current usage and significant corrections have been made in the translation of key texts. But throughout, our goal has been to retain the depth of meaning and enduring quality of language that have made their indelible mark on the English-speaking world and have defined the life and doctrine of its church over the last five centuries. Translation Philosophy The ESV is an “essentially literal” translation that seeks as far as possible to reproduce the precise wording of the original text and the personal style of each Bible writer. As such, its emphasis is on “word-for-word” correspondence, at the same time taking full account of differences in grammar, syntax, and idiom between current literary English and the original languages. Thus it seeks to be transparent to the original text, letting the reader see as directly as possible the structure and exact force of the original. In contrast to the ESV, some Bible versions have followed a “thought-for-thought” rather than “word-for-word” translation philosophy, emphasizing “dynamic equivalence” rather than the “essentially literal” meaning of the original. A “thought-for-thought” translation is of necessity more inclined to reflect the interpretive views of the translator and the influences of contemporary culture. Every translation is at many points a trade-off between literal precision and readability, between “formal equivalence” in expression and “functional equivalence” in communication, and the ESV is no exception. Within this framework we have sought to be “as literal as possible” while maintaining clarity of expression and literary excellence. Therefore, to the extent that plain English permits and the meaning in each case allows, we have sought to use the same English word for important recurring words in the original; and, as far as grammar and syntax allow, we have rendered Old Testament passages cited in the New in ways that show their correspondence. Thus in each of these areas, as well as throughout the Bible as a whole, we have sought to capture all the echoes and overtones of meaning that are so abundantly present in the original texts. As an essentially literal translation, taking into account grammar and syntax, the ESV thus seeks to carry over every possible nuance of meaning in the original words of Scripture into our own language. As such, the ESV is ideally suited for in-depth study of the Bible. Indeed, with its commitment to literary excellence, the ESV is equally well suited for public reading and preaching, for private reading and reflection, for both academic and devotional study, and for Scripture memorization. Translation Principles and Style The ESV also carries forward classic translation principles in its literary style. Accordingly it retains theological terminology—words such as grace, faith, justification, sanctification, redemption, regeneration, reconciliation, propitiation—because of their central importance for Christian doctrine and also because the underlying Greek words were already becoming key words and technical terms among Christians in New Testament times. The ESV lets the stylistic variety of the biblical writers fully express itself—from the exalted prose that opens Genesis, to the flowing narratives of the historical books, to the rich metaphors and dramatic imagery of the poetic books, to the ringing rhetoric in the prophetic books, to the smooth elegance of Luke, to the profound simplicities of John, and the closely reasoned logic of Paul. In punctuating, paragraphing, dividing long sentences, and rendering connectives, the ESV follows the path that seems to make the ongoing flow of thought clearest in English. The biblical languages regularly connect sentences by frequent repetition of words such as “and,” “but,” and “for,” in a way that goes beyond the conventions of current literary English. Effective translation, however, requires that these links in the original be reproduced so that the flow of the argument will be transparent to the reader. We have therefore normally translated these connectives, though occasionally we have varied the rendering by using alternatives (such as “also,” “however,” “now,” “so,” “then,” or “thus”) when they better express the linkage in specific instances. In the area of gender language, the goal of the ESV is to render literally what is in the original. For example, “anyone” replaces “any man” where there is no word corresponding to “man” in the original languages, and “people” rather than “men” is regularly used where the original languages refer to both men and women. But the words “man” and “men” are retained where a male meaning component is part of the original Greek or Hebrew. Likewise, the word “man” has been retained where the original text intends to convey a clear contrast between “God” on the one hand and “man” on the other hand, with “man” being used in the collective sense of the whole human race (see <a ref='Luke 2:52'>Luke 2:52</a> ). Similarly, the English word “brothers” (translating the Greek word <i>adelphoi</i> ) is retained as an important familial form of address between fellow-Jews and fellow-Christians in the first century. A recurring note is included to indicate that the term “brothers” ( <i>adelphoi</i> ) was often used in Greek to refer to both men and women, and to indicate the specific instances in the text where this is the case. In addition, the English word “sons” (translating the Greek word <i>huioi</i> ) is retained in specific instances because the underlying Greek term usually includes a male meaning component and it was used as a legal term in the adoption and inheritance laws of first-century Rome. As used by the apostle Paul, this term refers to the status of all Christians, both men and women, who, having been adopted into God’s family, now enjoy all the privileges, obligations, and inheritance rights of God’s children. The inclusive use of the generic “he” has also regularly been retained, because this is consistent with similar usage in the original languages and because an essentially literal translation would be impossible without it. In each case the objective has been transparency to the original text, allowing the reader to understand the original on its own terms rather than in the terms of our present-day Western culture. The Translation of Specialized Terms In the translation of biblical terms referring to God, the ESV takes great care to convey the specific nuances of meaning of the original Hebrew and Greek words. First, concerning terms that refer to God in the Old Testament: God, the Maker of heaven and earth, introduced himself to the people of Israel with a special personal name, the consonants for which are YHWH (see <a ref='Exodus 3:14–15'>Exodus 3:14–15</a> ). Scholars call this the “Tetragrammaton,” a Greek term referring to the four Hebrew letters YHWH. The exact pronunciation of YHWH is uncertain, because the Jewish people considered the personal name of God to be so holy that it should never be spoken aloud. Instead of reading the word YHWH, therefore, they would normally read the Hebrew word <i>’adonay</i> (“Lord”), and the ancient translations into Greek, Syriac, and Aramaic also followed this practice. When the vowels of the word <i>’adonay</i> are placed with the consonants of YHWH, this results in the familiar word <i>Jehovah</i> that was used in some earlier English Bible translations. As is common among English translations today, the ESV usually renders the personal name of God (YHWH) by the word Lord (printed in small capitals). An exception to this is when the Hebrew word <i>’adonay</i> appears together with YHWH, in which case the two words are rendered together as “the Lord [in lowercase] God [in small capitals].” In contrast to the personal name for God (YHWH), the more general name for God in Old Testament Hebrew is <i>’elohim</i> and its related forms of <i>’el</i> or <i>’eloah</i> , all of which are normally translated “God” (in lowercase letters). The use of these different ways to translate the Hebrew words for God is especially beneficial to English readers, enabling them to see and understand the different ways that the <i>personal</i> name and the <i>general</i> name for God are both used to refer to the <i>One True God</i> of the Old Testament. Second, in the New Testament, the Greek word <i>Christos</i> has been translated consistently as “Christ.” Although the term originally meant simply “anointed,” among Jews in New Testament times it had specifically come to designate the Messiah, the great Savior that God had promised to raise up. In other New Testament contexts, however, especially among Gentiles, <i>Christos</i> (“Christ”) was on its way to becoming a proper name. It is important, therefore, to keep the context in mind in understanding the various ways that <i>Christos</i> (“Christ”) is used in the New Testament. At the same time, in accord with its “essentially literal” translation philosophy, the ESV has retained consistency and concordance in the translation of <i>Christos</i> (“Christ”) throughout the New Testament. Third, a particular difficulty is presented when words in biblical Hebrew and Greek refer to ancient practices and institutions that do not correspond directly to those in the modern world. Such is the case in the translation of <i>‘ebed</i> (Hebrew) and <i>doulos</i> (Greek), terms which are often rendered “slave.” These terms, however, actually cover a range of relationships that requires a range of renderings—“slave,” “bondservant,” or “servant”—depending on the context. Further, the word “slave” currently carries associations with the often brutal and dehumanizing institution of slavery particularly in nineteenth-century America. For this reason, the ESV translation of the words <i>‘ebed</i> and <i>doulos</i> has been undertaken with particular attention to their meaning in each specific context. Thus in Old Testament times, one might enter slavery either voluntarily (e.g., to escape poverty or to pay off a debt) or involuntarily (e.g., by birth, by being captured in battle, or by judicial sentence). Protection for all in servitude in ancient Israel was provided by the Mosaic Law, including specific provisions for release from slavery. In New Testament times, a <i>doulos</i> is often best described as a “bondservant”—that is, someone in the Roman Empire officially bound under contract to serve his master for seven years (except for those in Caesar’s household in Rome who were contracted for fourteen years). When the contract expired, the person was freed, given his wage that had been saved by the master, and officially declared a freedman. The ESV usage thus seeks to express the most fitting nuance of meaning in each context. Where absolute ownership by a master is envisaged (as in <a ref='Ro 6'>Romans 6</a> ), “slave” is used; where a more limited form of servitude is in view, “bondservant” is used (as in <a ref='1 Corinthians 7:21–24'>1 Corinthians 7:21–24</a> ); where the context indicates a wide range of freedom (as in <a ref='John 4:51'>John 4:51</a> ), “servant” is preferred. Footnotes are generally provided to identify the Hebrew or Greek and the range of meaning that these terms may carry in each case. The issues involved in translating the Greek word <i>doulos</i> apply also to the Greek word <i>sundoulos</i> , translated in the text as “fellow servant.” Fourth, it is sometimes suggested that Bible translations should capitalize pronouns referring to deity. It has seemed best not to capitalize deity pronouns in the ESV, however, for the following reasons: first, there is nothing in the original Hebrew and Greek manuscripts that corresponds to such capitalization; second, the practice of capitalizing deity pronouns in English Bible translations is a recent innovation, which began only in the mid-twentieth century; and, third, such capitalization is absent from the KJV Bible and the whole stream of Bible translations that the ESV carries forward. A fifth specialized term, the word “behold,” usually has been retained as the most common translation for the Hebrew word <i>hinneh</i> and the Greek word <i>idou</i> . Both of these words mean something like “Pay careful attention to what follows! This is important!” Other than the word “behold,” there is no single word in English that fits well in most contexts. Although “Look!” and “See!” and “Listen!” would be workable in some contexts, in many others these words lack sufficient weight and dignity. Given the principles of “essentially literal” translation, it is important not to leave <i>hinneh</i> and <i>idou</i> completely untranslated and so to lose the intended emphasis in the original languages. The older and more formal word “behold” has usually been retained, therefore, as the best available option for conveying the original weight of meaning. Textual Basis and Resources The ESV is based on the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible as found in <i>Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</i> (5th ed., 1997), and on the Greek text in the 2014 editions of the <i>Greek New Testament</i> (5th corrected ed.), published by the United Bible Societies (UBS), and <i>Novum Testamentum Graece</i> (28th ed., 2012), edited by Nestle and Aland. The currently renewed respect among Old Testament scholars for the Masoretic text is reflected in the ESV’s attempt, wherever possible, to translate difficult Hebrew passages as they stand in the Masoretic text rather than resorting to emendations or to finding an alternative reading in the ancient versions. In exceptional, difficult cases, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Septuagint, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Syriac Peshitta, the Latin Vulgate, and other sources were consulted to shed possible light on the text, or, if necessary, to support a divergence from the Masoretic text. Similarly, in a few difficult cases in the New Testament, the ESV has followed a Greek text different from the text given preference in the UBS/Nestle-Aland 28th edition. Throughout, the translation team has benefited greatly from the massive textual resources that have become readily available recently, from new insights into biblical laws and culture, and from current advances in Hebrew and Greek lexicography and grammatical understanding. Textual Footnotes The footnotes that are included in most editions of the ESV are therefore an integral part of the ESV translation, informing the reader of textual variations and difficulties and showing how these have been resolved by the ESV translation team. In addition to this, the footnotes indicate significant alternative readings and occasionally provide an explanation for technical terms or for a difficult reading in the text. Publishing Team The ESV publishing team has included more than a hundred people. The fourteen-member Translation Oversight Committee benefited from the work of more than fifty biblical experts serving as Translation Review Scholars and from the comments of the more than fifty members of the Advisory Council, all of which was carried out under the auspices of the Crossway Board of Directors. This hundred-plus-member team shares a common commitment to the truth of God’s Word and to historic Christian orthodoxy and is international in scope, including leaders in many denominations. To God’s Honor and Praise We know that no Bible translation is perfect; but we also know that God uses imperfect and inadequate things to his honor and praise. So to our triune God and to his people we offer what we have done, with our prayers that it may prove useful, with gratitude for much help given, and with ongoing wonder that our God should ever have entrusted to us so momentous a task. <i>Soli Deo Gloria!</i> —To God alone be the glory! <i>The Translation Oversight Committee</i>",

    "content": "Explanation of Features Included in this Edition The MacArthur Study Bible, Second Edition, ESV includes a number of valuable features to encourage the reading and study of the Bible. A brief description is provided below explaining the purpose and use of these features. Section Headings Section headings have been included throughout the text of the MacArthur Study Bible, Second Edition, ESV. While the headings are not part of the Bible text itself, they have been provided to help identify and locate important themes and topics throughout the Bible. Cross-Reference System The MacArthur Study Bible, Second Edition, ESV includes one of the most extensive and useful cross-reference systems available. The ESV cross-reference system is based on a comprehensive system developed more than a hundred years ago by a team of Bible scholars from Oxford and Cambridge Universities. As far as possible this system also included the cross-references used in the original King James Version of 1611. The resulting cross-reference system was first used in the English Revised Version (RV) and has been highly regarded around the world for its effectiveness in showing the internal interrelationship of the text throughout the Bible. The cross-reference system as it appears in The MacArthur Study Bible, ESV, Second Edition has been adapted from the RV system for use with the ESV. In some cases, therefore, the specific wording of the reference passage may differ, although the underlying meaning and relationship to the referenced text is normally the same. Because the ESV is an essentially literal, word-for-word translation, the ESV is especially suited for cross-reference study of key words and concepts throughout the Bible. Using the ESV Cross-Reference System If there is a cross-reference for a portion of Bible text, this is indicated by a <i>letter</i> superscript. These always <i>precede</i> the text to which they apply. <i>Number</i> superscripts, which always <i>follow</i> the words to which they apply, indicate textual footnotes. For example, in the phrase “ a from faith for faith 1 ” the superscripted letter “a” preceding the phrase refers to a cross-reference while the superscripted number “1” at the end refers to a footnote. Types of Cross-References The ESV cross-reference system includes several types of cross-references, some of which are illustrated here from <a ref='Romans 3:3–4'>Romans 3:3–4</a> . These include: The notations “(Heb.)” and “(Gk.)” indicate that the reference is clearer in Hebrew or Greek than in English. “(Gk.)” in New Testament citations of the Old Testament indicates that the reference is most clear in the Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Old Testament. Footnotes Several kinds of footnotes related to the ESV text are provided throughout the ESV Bible to assist the reader. These footnotes are indicated in the ESV text by a superscript <i>number</i> that <i>follows</i> the word or phrase to which the footnote applies (e.g., “Isaac 2 ”). Superscript <i>letters</i> that <i>precede</i> a word (e.g., “ c Isaac”) are used to indicate cross-references (see cross-reference explanation above). The footnotes included in the ESV Bible are an integral part of the text and provide important information concerning the understanding and translation of the text. The footnotes fall mainly into four categories, as illustrated in the examples below. Types of Footnotes",

Coupled with this were ambitious building and commercial projects throughout his expanding kingdom. As a result, Solomon faced an urgent need for ever-increasing revenues. To address this need, Solomon divided Israel into 12 districts and appointed governors over each district. These governors were responsible for levying and collecting taxes to provide for the needs of Jerusalem and the royal palace. The increasingly heavy taxes upon Israel created major dissension because the region of Judah was exempted. Furthermore, the divisions of the districts violated the old tribal boundaries.

    "content": "The Chronicles’ Sources The inspiration of Scripture ( <a ref='2 Timothy 3:16'>2 Tim. 3:16</a> ) was sometimes accomplished through direct revelation from God without a human writer, e.g., the Mosaic law. At other times, God used human sources, as mentioned in <a ref='Luke 1:1–4'>Luke 1:1–4</a> . Such was the experience of the chronicler as evidenced by the many contributing sources. Whether the material came through direct revelation or by existing resources, God’s inspiration through the Holy Spirit prevented the original human authors of Scripture from any error ( <a ref='2 Peter 1:19–21'>2 Pet. 1:19–21</a> ). Although relatively few scribal errors have been made in copying Scripture, they can be identified and corrected. Thus, the original, inerrant content of the Bible has been preserved. 1.

At Shechem the people, with Jeroboam as their leader, asked for change. Rehoboam’s harsh rejection of their demands led to the people’s rebellious response: “To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David” ( <a ref='1 Kings 12:16'>1 Kings 12:16</a> ). The kingdom split, Rehoboam reigned over Judah in the south, and Jeroboam became king of Israel in the north.

    "content": "Events of Holy Week The Gospel writers devoted much of their material to the events leading up to the crucifixion of Jesus. The final week of his earthly ministry began with the Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem and the “Hosannas” from the crowd that changed to cries of “Crucify him” before the week was over. Jesus apparently spent most of the week teaching in the temple area during the day. His evenings were spent in the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus in Bethany. Significant events during this week included the plot of the Sanhedrin, Jesus’ betrayal and arrest, the trials of Jesus, his journey to Golgotha down the Jerusalem street known today as the Via Dolorosa (“Way of Suffering”), and the resurrection. After his resurrection, Jesus ministered another forty days before his ascension.

We teach that the Word of God is an objective, propositional revelation ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:13'>1 Cor. 2:13</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 2:13'>1 Thess. 2:13</a> ), verbally inspired in every word ( <a ref='2 Timothy 3:16'>2 Tim. 3:16</a> ), absolutely inerrant in the original documents, infallible, and God-breathed. We teach the literal, grammatical-historical interpretation of Scripture, which affirms the belief that the opening chapters of Genesis present creation in six literal days ( <a ref='Genesis 1:31'>Gen. 1:31</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 31:17'>Ex. 31:17</a> ). We teach that the Bible constitutes the only infallible rule of faith and practice ( <a ref='Matthew 5:18'>Matt. 5:18</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:35'>24:35</a> ; <a ref='John 10:35'>John 10:35</a> ; <a ref='John 16:12–13'>16:12–13</a> ; <a ref='John 17:17'>17:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:13'>1 Cor. 2:13</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 3:15–17'>2 Tim. 3:15–17</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 4:12'>Heb. 4:12</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 1:20–21'>2 Pet. 1:20–21</a> ). We teach that God spoke in his written Word by a process of dual authorship. The Holy Spirit so superintended the human authors that, through their individual personalities and different styles of writing, they composed and recorded God’s Word to humanity ( <a ref='2 Peter 1:20–21'>2 Pet. 1:20–21</a> ) without error in the whole or in the part ( <a ref='Matthew 5:18'>Matt. 5:18</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 3:16'>2 Tim. 3:16</a> ). We teach that, whereas there may be several applications of any given passage of Scripture, there is but one true interpretation. The meaning of Scripture is to be found as one diligently applies the literal, grammatical-historical method of interpretation under the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit ( <a ref='John 7:17'>John 7:17</a> ; <a ref='John 16:12–15'>16:12–15</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:7–15'>1 Cor. 2:7–15</a> ; <a ref='1 John 2:20'>1 John 2:20</a> ). It is the responsibility of believers to ascertain carefully the true intent and meaning of Scripture, recognizing that proper application is binding on all generations. Yet the truth of Scripture stands in judgment of men; never do men stand in judgment of it. God We teach that there is but one living and true God ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:4'>Deut. 6:4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 45:5–7'>Isa. 45:5–7</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 8:4'>1 Cor. 8:4</a> ), an infinite, all-knowing Spirit ( <a ref='John 4:24'>John 4:24</a> ), perfect in all his attributes, one in essence, eternally existing in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit ( <a ref='Matthew 28:19'>Matt. 28:19</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 13:14'>2 Cor. 13:14</a> )—each equally deserving worship and obedience. God the Father We teach that God the Father, the first person of the Trinity, orders and disposes all things according to his own purpose and grace ( <a ref='Psalms 145:8–9'>Ps. 145:8–9</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 8:6'>1 Cor. 8:6</a> ). He is the Creator of all things ( <a ref='Genesis 1:1–31'>Gen. 1:1–31</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 3:9'>Eph. 3:9</a> ). As the only absolute and omnipotent ruler in the universe, he is sovereign in creation, providence, and redemption ( <a ref='Psalms 103:19'>Ps. 103:19</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:36'>Rom. 11:36</a> ). His fatherhood involves both his designation within the Trinity and his relationship with humankind. As Creator he is Father to all people ( <a ref='Ephesians 4:6'>Eph. 4:6</a> ), but he is Spiritual Father only to believers ( <a ref='Romans 8:14'>Rom. 8:14</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:18'>2 Cor. 6:18</a> ). He has decreed for his own glory all things that come to pass ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:11'>Eph. 1:11</a> ). He continually upholds, directs, and governs all creatures and events ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 29:11'>1 Chron. 29:11</a> ). In his sovereignty he is neither author nor approver of sin ( <a ref='Habakkuk 1:13'>Hab. 1:13</a> ), nor does he abridge the accountability of moral, intelligent creatures ( <a ref='1 Peter 1:17'>1 Pet. 1:17</a> ). He has graciously chosen from eternity past those whom he would have as his own ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:4–6'>Eph. 1:4–6</a> ); he saves from sin all those who come to him through Jesus Christ; he adopts as his own all those who come to him; and he becomes, upon adoption, Father to his own ( <a ref='John 1:12'>John 1:12</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:15'>Rom. 8:15</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 4:5'>Gal. 4:5</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 12:5–9'>Heb. 12:5–9</a> ). God the Son We teach that Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, possesses all the divine excellencies, and in these he is coequal, consubstantial, and coeternal with the Father ( <a ref='John 10:30'>John 10:30</a> ; <a ref='John 14:9'>14:9</a> ). We teach that God the Father created “the heavens and the earth, and all that is in them” ( <a ref='Jeremiah 51:48'>Jer. 51:48</a> ) according to his own will, through his Son, Jesus Christ, by whom all things continue in existence and in operations ( <a ref='John 1:3'>John 1:3</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:15–17'>Col. 1:15–17</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 1:2'>Heb. 1:2</a> ). We teach that in the incarnation (God becoming man) Christ surrendered only the prerogatives of deity but nothing of the divine essence, either in degree or kind. In his incarnation, the eternally existing second person of the Trinity accepted all the essential characteristics of humanity and so became the God-man ( <a ref='Philippians 2:5–8'>Phil. 2:5–8</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:9'>Col. 2:9</a> ). We teach that Jesus Christ represents humanity and deity in indivisible oneness ( <a ref='Micah 5:2'>Mic. 5:2</a> ; <a ref='John 5:23'>John 5:23</a> ; <a ref='John 14:9–10'>14:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:9'>Col. 2:9</a> ). We teach that our Lord Jesus Christ was virgin born ( <a ref='Isaiah 7:14'>Isa. 7:14</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 1:23'>Matt. 1:23</a> , <a ref='Matthew 1:25'>25</a> ; <a ref='Luke 1:26–35'>Luke 1:26–35</a> ); that he was God incarnate ( <a ref='John 1:1'>John 1:1</a> , <a ref='John 1:14'>14</a> ); and that the purpose of the incarnation was to reveal God, redeem men, and rule over God’s kingdom ( <a ref='Psalms 2:7–9'>Ps. 2:7–9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 9:6'>Isa. 9:6</a> ; <a ref='John 1:29'>John 1:29</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 2:9–11'>Phil. 2:9–11</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 7:25–26'>Heb. 7:25–26</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:18–19'>1 Pet. 1:18–19</a> ). We teach that, in the incarnation, the second person of the Trinity laid aside his right to the full prerogatives of coexistence with God, assumed the place of a Son, and took on an existence appropriate to a servant while never divesting himself of his divine attributes ( <a ref='Philippians 2:5–8'>Phil. 2:5–8</a> ). We teach that our Lord Jesus Christ accomplished our redemption through the shedding of his blood and sacrificial death on the cross and that his death was voluntary, vicarious, substitutionary, propitiatory, and redemptive ( <a ref='John 10:15'>John 10:15</a> ; <a ref='Romans 3:24–25'>Rom. 3:24–25</a> ; <a ref='Romans 5:8'>5:8</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:24'>1 Pet. 2:24</a> ). We teach that on the basis of the efficacy of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, the believing sinner is freed from the punishment, the penalty, the power, and one day the very presence of sin; and that he is declared righteous, given eternal life, and adopted into the family of God ( <a ref='Romans 3:25'>Rom. 3:25</a> ; <a ref='Romans 5:8–9'>5:8–9</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:14–15'>2 Cor. 5:14–15</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:24'>1 Pet. 2:24</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 3:18'>3:18</a> ). We teach that our justification is made sure by his literal, physical resurrection from the dead and that he is now ascended to the right hand of the Father, where he now mediates as our Advocate and High Priest ( <a ref='Matthew 28:6'>Matt. 28:6</a> ; <a ref='Luke 24:38'>Luke 24:38</a> , <a ref='Luke 24:39'>39</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:30'>Acts 2:30</a> , <a ref='Acts 2:31'>31</a> ; <a ref='Romans 4:25'>Rom. 4:25</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:34'>8:34</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 7:25'>Heb. 7:25</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:24'>9:24</a> ; <a ref='1 John 2:1'>1 John 2:1</a> ). We teach that in the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the grave, God confirmed the deity of his Son and gave proof that God has accepted the atoning work of Christ on the cross. Jesus’ bodily resurrection is also the guarantee of a future resurrection life for all believers ( <a ref='John 5:26–29'>John 5:26–29</a> ; <a ref='John 14:19'>14:19</a> ; <a ref='Romans 4:25'>Rom. 4:25</a> ; <a ref='Romans 6:5–10'>6:5–10</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:20'>1 Cor. 15:20</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:23'>23</a> ). We teach that Jesus Christ will return to receive the church, which is his body, unto himself at the rapture and, returning with his church in glory, will establish his millennial kingdom on earth ( <a ref='Acts 1:9–11'>Acts 1:9–11</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:13–18'>1 Thess. 4:13–18</a> ; <a ref='Rev 20'>Rev. 20</a> ). We teach that the Lord Jesus Christ is the one through whom God will judge all humankind ( <a ref='John 5:22–23'>John 5:22–23</a> ): As the mediator between God and man ( <a ref='1 Timothy 2:5'>1 Tim. 2:5</a> ), the head of his body, the church ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:22'>Eph. 1:22</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:23'>5:23</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:18'>Col. 1:18</a> ), and the coming universal King who will reign on the throne of David ( <a ref='Isaiah 9:6'>Isa. 9:6</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 9:7'>7</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 37:24–28'>Ezek. 37:24–28</a> ; <a ref='Luke 1:31–33'>Luke 1:31–33</a> ), he is the final judge of all who fail to place their trust in him as Lord and Savior ( <a ref='Matthew 25:14–46'>Matt. 25:14–46</a> ; <a ref='Acts 17:30–31'>Acts 17:30–31</a> ). God the Holy Spirit We teach that the Holy Spirit is a divine person, eternal, underived, possessing all the attributes of personality and deity, including intellect ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:10–13'>1 Cor. 2:10–13</a> ), emotions ( <a ref='Ephesians 4:30'>Eph. 4:30</a> ), will ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:11'>1 Cor. 12:11</a> ), eternality ( <a ref='Hebrews 9:14'>Heb. 9:14</a> ), omnipresence ( <a ref='Psalms 139:7–10'>Ps. 139:7–10</a> ), omniscience ( <a ref='Isaiah 40:13–14'>Isa. 40:13–14</a> ), omnipotence ( <a ref='Romans 15:13'>Rom. 15:13</a> ), and truthfulness ( <a ref='John 16:13'>John 16:13</a> ). In all the divine attributes he is coequal and consubstantial with the Father and the Son ( <a ref='Matthew 28:19'>Matt. 28:19</a> ; <a ref='Acts 5:3–4'>Acts 5:3–4</a> ; <a ref='Acts 28:25–26'>28:25–26</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:4–6'>1 Cor. 12:4–6</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 13:14'>2 Cor. 13:14</a> ; and <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer. 31:31–34</a> with <a ref='Hebrews 10:15–17'>Heb. 10:15–17</a> ). We teach that it is the work of the Holy Spirit to execute the divine will with relation to all humankind. We recognize his sovereign activity in the creation ( <a ref='Genesis 1:2'>Gen. 1:2</a> ), the incarnation ( <a ref='Matthew 1:18'>Matt. 1:18</a> ), the written revelation ( <a ref='2 Peter 1:20–21'>2 Pet. 1:20–21</a> ), and the work of salvation ( <a ref='John 3:5–7'>John 3:5–7</a> ). We teach that a unique work of the Holy Spirit in this age began at Pentecost when he came from the Father as promised by Christ ( <a ref='John 14:16–17'>John 14:16–17</a> ; <a ref='John 15:26'>15:26</a> ) to initiate and complete the building of the body of Christ. His activity includes convicting the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment; glorifying the Lord Jesus Christ; and transforming believers into the image of Christ ( <a ref='John 16:7–9'>John 16:7–9</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:5'>Acts 1:5</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:4'>2:4</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:29'>Rom. 8:29</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 3:18'>2 Cor. 3:18</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:22'>Eph. 2:22</a> ). We teach that the Holy Spirit is the supernatural and sovereign agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers into the body of Christ ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:13'>1 Cor. 12:13</a> ). The Holy Spirit also indwells, sanctifies, instructs, empowers them for service, and seals them unto the day of redemption ( <a ref='Romans 8:9–11'>Rom. 8:9–11</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 3:6'>2 Cor. 3:6</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:13'>Eph. 1:13</a> ). We teach that the Holy Spirit is the divine teacher who guided the apostles and prophets into all truth as they committed to writing God’s revelation, the Bible ( <a ref='2 Peter 1:19–21'>2 Pet. 1:19–21</a> ). Every believer possesses the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit from the moment of salvation, and it is the duty of all those born of the Spirit to be filled with (controlled by) the Spirit ( <a ref='Romans 8:9–11'>Rom. 8:9–11</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:18'>Eph. 5:18</a> ; <a ref='1 John 2:20'>1 John 2:20</a> , <a ref='1 John 2:27'>27</a> ). We teach that the Holy Spirit administers spiritual gifts to the church. The Holy Spirit glorifies neither himself nor his gifts by ostentatious displays, but he does glorify Christ by implementing his work of redeeming the lost and building up believers in the most holy faith ( <a ref='John 16:13–14'>John 16:13–14</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:8'>Acts 1:8</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:4–11'>1 Cor. 12:4–11</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 3:18'>2 Cor. 3:18</a> ). We teach, in this respect, that God the Holy Spirit is sovereign in the bestowing of all his gifts for the perfecting of the saints today and that speaking in tongues and the working of sign miracles in the beginning days of the church were for the purpose of pointing to and authenticating the apostles as revealers of divine truth, and were never intended to be characteristic of the lives of believers ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:4–11'>1 Cor. 12:4–11</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 13:8–10'>13:8–10</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 12:12'>2 Cor. 12:12</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 4:7–12'>Eph. 4:7–12</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 2:1–4'>Heb. 2:1–4</a> ). Man We teach that man was directly and immediately created by God in his image and likeness. Man was created free of sin with a rational nature, intelligence, volition, self-determination, and moral responsibility to God ( <a ref='Genesis 2:7'>Gen. 2:7</a> , <a ref='Genesis 2:15–25'>15–25</a> ; <a ref='James 3:9'>James 3:9</a> ). We teach that God’s intention in the creation of man was that man should glorify God, enjoy God’s fellowship, live his life in the will of God, and by this accomplish God’s purpose for man in the world ( <a ref='Isaiah 43:7'>Isa. 43:7</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:16'>Col. 1:16</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 4:11'>Rev. 4:11</a> ). We teach that in Adam’s sin of disobedience to the revealed will and Word of God, man lost his innocence, incurred the penalty of spiritual and physical death, became subject to the wrath of God, and became inherently corrupt and utterly incapable of choosing or doing that which is acceptable to God apart from divine grace. With no recuperative powers to enable him to recover himself, man is hopelessly lost. Man’s salvation is thereby wholly of God’s grace through the redemptive work of our Lord Jesus Christ ( <a ref='Genesis 2:16–17'>Gen. 2:16–17</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 3:1–19'>3:1–19</a> ; <a ref='John 3:36'>John 3:36</a> ; <a ref='Romans 3:23'>Rom. 3:23</a> ; <a ref='Romans 6:23'>6:23</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:14'>1 Cor. 2:14</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:1–3'>Eph. 2:1–3</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 2:13–14'>1 Tim. 2:13–14</a> ; <a ref='1 John 1:8'>1 John 1:8</a> ). We teach that because all men were in Adam, a nature corrupted by Adam’s sin has been transmitted to all men of all ages, Jesus Christ being the only exception. All men are thus sinners by nature, by choice, and by divine declaration ( <a ref='Psalms 14:1–3'>Ps. 14:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 17:9'>Jer. 17:9</a> ; <a ref='Romans 3:9–18'>Rom. 3:9–18</a> , <a ref='Romans 3:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Romans 5:10–12'>5:10–12</a> ). Salvation We teach that salvation is wholly of God by grace on the basis of the redemption of Jesus Christ, the merit of his shed blood, and not on the basis of human merit or works ( <a ref='John 1:12'>John 1:12</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:4–7'>Eph. 1:4–7</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 2:8–10'>2:8–10</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:18–19'>1 Pet. 1:18–19</a> ). Election We teach that election is the act of God by which, before the foundation of the world, he chose in Christ those whom he graciously regenerates, saves, and sanctifies ( <a ref='Romans 8:28–30'>Rom. 8:28–30</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:4–11'>Eph. 1:4–11</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:13'>2 Thess. 2:13</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 2:10'>2 Tim. 2:10</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:1–2'>1 Pet. 1:1–2</a> ). We teach that sovereign election does not contradict or negate the responsibility of man to repent and trust Christ as Savior and Lord ( <a ref='Ezekiel 18:23'>Ezek. 18:23</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 18:32'>32</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 33:11'>33:11</a> ; <a ref='John 3:18–19'>John 3:18–19</a> , <a ref='John 3:36'>36</a> ; <a ref='John 5:40'>5:40</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:10–12'>2 Thess. 2:10–12</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 22:17'>Rev. 22:17</a> ). Nevertheless, since sovereign grace includes the means of receiving the gift of salvation as well as the gift itself, sovereign election will result in what God determines. All whom the Father calls to himself will come in faith, and all who come in faith the Father will receive ( <a ref='John 6:37–40'>John 6:37–40</a> , <a ref='John 6:44'>44</a> ; <a ref='Acts 13:48'>Acts 13:48</a> ; <a ref='James 4:8'>James 4:8</a> ). We teach that the unmerited favor that God grants to totally depraved sinners is not related to any initiative of their own part nor to God’s anticipation of what they might do by their own will, but is solely of his sovereign grace and mercy ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:4–7'>Eph. 1:4–7</a> ; <a ref='Titus 3:4–7'>Titus 3:4–7</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:2'>1 Pet. 1:2</a> ). We teach that election should not be looked upon as based merely on abstract sovereignty. God is truly sovereign, but he exercises this sovereignty in harmony with his other attributes, especially his omniscience, justice, holiness, wisdom, grace, and love ( <a ref='Romans 9:11–16'>Rom. 9:11–16</a> ). This sovereignty will always exalt the will of God in a manner totally consistent with his character as revealed in the life of our Lord Jesus Christ ( <a ref='Matthew 11:25–28'>Matt. 11:25–28</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 1:9'>2 Tim. 1:9</a> ). Regeneration We teach that regeneration is a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit by which the divine nature and divine life are given ( <a ref='John 3:3–8'>John 3:3–8</a> ; <a ref='Titus 3:5'>Titus 3:5</a> ). It is instantaneous and is accomplished solely by the power of the Holy Spirit through the instrumentality of the Word of God ( <a ref='John 5:24'>John 5:24</a> ), when the repentant sinner, as enabled by the Holy Spirit, responds in faith to the divine provision of salvation. Genuine regeneration is manifested by fruits worthy of repentance as demonstrated in righteous attitudes and conduct. Good works will be its proper evidence and fruit ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:19'>1 Cor. 6:19</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:17–21'>Eph. 5:17–21</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 2:12'>Phil. 2:12b</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 3:12–17'>Col. 3:12–17</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 1:4–11'>2 Pet. 1:4–11</a> ). This obedience causes the believer to be increasingly conformed to the image of our Lord Jesus Christ ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 3:18'>2 Cor. 3:18</a> ). Such a conformity is climaxed in the believer’s glorification at Christ’s coming ( <a ref='Romans 8:16–17'>Rom. 8:16–17</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 1:4'>2 Pet. 1:4</a> ; <a ref='1 John 3:2–3'>1 John 3:2–3</a> ). Justification We teach that justification before God is an act of God ( <a ref='Romans 8:30'>Rom. 8:30</a> , <a ref='Romans 8:33'>33</a> ) by which he declares righteous those who, through faith in Christ, repent of their sins ( <a ref='Luke 13:3'>Luke 13:3</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:38'>Acts 2:38</a> ; <a ref='Acts 3:19'>3:19</a> ; <a ref='Acts 11:18'>11:18</a> ; <a ref='Romans 2:4'>Rom. 2:4</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 7:10'>2 Cor. 7:10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 55:6–7'>Isa. 55:6–7</a> ) and confess him as sovereign Lord ( <a ref='Romans 10:9–10'>Rom. 10:9–10</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:3'>1 Cor. 12:3</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:5'>2 Cor. 4:5</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 2:11'>Phil. 2:11</a> ). This righteousness is apart from any virtue or work of man ( <a ref='Romans 3:20'>Rom. 3:20</a> ; <a ref='Romans 4:6'>4:6</a> ) and involves the placing of our sins on Christ ( <a ref='Colossians 2:14'>Col. 2:14</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:24'>1 Pet. 2:24</a> ) and the imputation of Christ’s righteousness to us ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:2'>1 Cor. 1:2</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:30'>30</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:11'>6:11</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2 Cor. 5:21</a> ). By this means God is enabled to “be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus” ( <a ref='Romans 3:26'>Rom. 3:26</a> ). Sanctification We teach that every believer is sanctified (set apart) unto God by justification and is therefore declared to be holy and is therefore identified as a saint. This sanctification is positional and instantaneous and should not be confused with progressive sanctification. This sanctification has to do with the believer’s standing, not his present walk or condition ( <a ref='Acts 20:32'>Acts 20:32</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:2'>1 Cor. 1:2</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:30'>30</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:11'>6:11</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:13'>2 Thess. 2:13</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 2:11'>Heb. 2:11</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 3:1'>3:1</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:10'>10:10</a> , <a ref='Hebrews 10:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 13:12'>13:12</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:2'>1 Pet. 1:2</a> ). We teach that there is also by the work of the Holy Spirit a progressive sanctification by which the state of the believer is brought closer to the likeness of Christ through obedience to the Word of God and the empowering of the Holy Spirit. The believer is able to live a life of increasing holiness in conformity to the will of God, becoming more and more like our Lord Jesus Christ ( <a ref='John 17:17'>John 17:17</a> , <a ref='John 17:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Romans 6:1–22'>Rom. 6:1–22</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 3:18'>2 Cor. 3:18</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:3–4'>1 Thess. 4:3–4</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:23'>5:23</a> ). In this respect, we teach that every saved person is involved in a daily conflict—the new creation in Christ doing battle against the flesh—but adequate provision is made for victory through the power of the indwelling Holy Spirit. The struggle nevertheless stays with the believer all through this earthly life and is never completely ended. All claims to the eradication of sin in this life are unscriptural. Eradication of sin is not possible, but the Holy Spirit does provide for victory over sin ( <a ref='Galatians 5:16–25'>Gal. 5:16–25</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:12'>Phil. 3:12</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 3:9–10'>Col. 3:9–10</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:14–16'>1 Pet. 1:14–16</a> ; <a ref='1 John 3:5–9'>1 John 3:5–9</a> ). Security We teach that all the redeemed once saved are kept by God’s power and are thus secure in Christ forever ( <a ref='John 5:24'>John 5:24</a> ; <a ref='John 6:37–40'>6:37–40</a> ; <a ref='John 10:27–30'>10:27–30</a> ; <a ref='Romans 5:9–10'>Rom. 5:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:1'>8:1</a> , <a ref='Romans 8:31–39'>31–39</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:4–9'>1 Cor. 1:4–9</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 4:30'>Eph. 4:30</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 7:25'>Heb. 7:25</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 13:5'>13:5</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:4–5'>1 Pet. 1:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Jude 1:24'>Jude 24</a> ). We teach that it is the privilege of believers to rejoice in the assurance of their salvation through the testimony of God’s Word, which, however, clearly forbids the use of Christian liberty as an excuse for sinful living and carnality ( <a ref='Romans 6:15–22'>Rom. 6:15–22</a> ; <a ref='Romans 13:13–14'>13:13–14</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 5:13'>Gal. 5:13</a> , <a ref='Galatians 5:16–17'>16–17</a> , <a ref='Galatians 5:25–26'>25–26</a> ; <a ref='Titus 2:11–14'>Titus 2:11–14</a> ). Separation We teach that separation from sin is clearly called for throughout the Old and New Testaments, and that the Scriptures clearly indicate that in the last days apostasy and worldliness shall increase ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:14–7:1'>2 Cor. 6:14—7:1</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 3:1–5'>2 Tim. 3:1–5</a> ). We teach that out of deep gratitude for the undeserved grace of God granted to us and because our glorious God is so worthy of our total consecration, all the saved should live in such a manner as to demonstrate our adoring love to God and so as not to bring reproach upon our Lord and Savior. We also teach that separation from any association with religious apostasy, and worldly and sinful practices, is commanded of us by God ( <a ref='Romans 12:1–2'>Rom. 12:1–2</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 5:9–13'>1 Cor. 5:9–13</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:14–7:1'>2 Cor. 6:14—7:1</a> ; <a ref='1 John 2:15–17'>1 John 2:15–17</a> ; <a ref='2 John 1:9–11'>2 John 9–11</a> ). We teach that believers should be separated unto our Lord Jesus Christ ( <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:11'>2 Thess. 1:11</a> , <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 12:1–2'>Heb. 12:1–2</a> ) and affirm that the Christian life is a life of obedient righteousness demonstrated by a beatitude attitude ( <a ref='Matthew 5:2–12'>Matt. 5:2–12</a> ) and a continual pursuit of holiness ( <a ref='Romans 12:1–2'>Rom. 12:1–2</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 7:1'>2 Cor. 7:1</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 12:14'>Heb. 12:14</a> ; <a ref='Titus 2:11–14'>Titus 2:11–14</a> ; <a ref='1 John 3:1–10'>1 John 3:1–10</a> ). The Church We teach that all who place their faith in Jesus Christ are immediately placed by the Holy Spirit into one united spiritual body, the church ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:12–13'>1 Cor. 12:12–13</a> ), the bride of Christ ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 11:2'>2 Cor. 11:2</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:23–32'>Eph. 5:23–32</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:7–8'>Rev. 19:7–8</a> ), of which Christ is the head ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:22'>Eph. 1:22</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 4:15'>4:15</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:18'>Col. 1:18</a> ). We teach that the formation of the church, the body of Christ, began on the day of Pentecost ( <a ref='Acts 2:1–21'>Acts 2:1–21</a> , <a ref='Acts 2:38–47'>38–47</a> ) and will be completed at the coming of Christ for his own at the rapture ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:51–52'>1 Cor. 15:51–52</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:13–18'>1 Thess. 4:13–18</a> ). We teach that the church is thus a unique spiritual organism designed by Christ, made up of all born-again believers in this present age ( <a ref='Ephesians 2:11–3:6'>Eph. 2:11—3:6</a> ). The church is distinct from Israel ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:32'>1 Cor. 10:32</a> ), a mystery not revealed until this age ( <a ref='Ephesians 3:1–6'>Eph. 3:1–6</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:32'>5:32</a> ). We teach that the establishment and continuity of local churches is clearly taught and defined in the New Testament Scriptures ( <a ref='Acts 14:23'>Acts 14:23</a> , <a ref='Acts 14:27'>27</a> ; <a ref='Acts 20:17'>20:17</a> , <a ref='Acts 20:28'>28</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 1:2'>Gal. 1:2</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 1:1'>Phil. 1:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 1:1'>1 Thess. 1:1</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:1'>2 Thess. 1:1</a> ) and that the members of the one spiritual body are directed to associate themselves together in local assemblies ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 11:18–20'>1 Cor. 11:18–20</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:25'>Heb. 10:25</a> ). We teach that the one supreme authority for the church is Christ ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:22'>Eph. 1:22</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:18'>Col. 1:18</a> ) and that church leadership, gifts, order, discipline, and worship are all appointed through his sovereignty as found in the Scriptures. The biblically designated officers serving under Christ and over the assembly are elders (males, who are also called bishops, pastors, and pastor-teachers; <a ref='Acts 20:28'>Acts 20:28</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 4:11'>Eph. 4:11</a> ) and deacons, both of whom must meet biblical qualifications ( <a ref='1 Timothy 3:1–13'>1 Tim. 3:1–13</a> ; <a ref='Titus 1:5–9'>Titus 1:5–9</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 5:1–5'>1 Pet. 5:1–5</a> ). We teach that these leaders lead or rule as servants of Christ ( <a ref='1 Timothy 5:17–22'>1 Tim. 5:17–22</a> ) and have his authority in directing the church. The congregation is to submit to their leadership ( <a ref='Hebrews 13:7'>Heb. 13:7</a> , <a ref='Hebrews 13:17'>17</a> ). We teach the importance of discipleship ( <a ref='Matthew 28:19–20'>Matt. 28:19–20</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 2:2'>2 Tim. 2:2</a> ), mutual accountability of all believers to each other ( <a ref='Matthew 18:15–17'>Matt. 18:15–17</a> ), as well as the need for discipline for sinning members of the congregation in accord with the standards of Scripture ( <a ref='Matthew 18:15–22'>Matt. 18:15–22</a> ; <a ref='Acts 5:1–11'>Acts 5:1–11</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 5:1–13'>1 Cor. 5:1–13</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 3:6–15'>2 Thess. 3:6–15</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 1:19–20'>1 Tim. 1:19–20</a> ; <a ref='Titus 1:10–16'>Titus 1:10–16</a> ). We teach the autonomy of the local church, free from any external authority or control, with the right of self-government and freedom from the interference of any hierarchy of individuals or organizations ( <a ref='Titus 1:5'>Titus 1:5</a> ). We teach that it is scriptural for true churches to cooperate with each other for the presentation and propagation of the faith. Local churches, however, through their pastors and their interpretation and application of Scripture, should be the sole judges of the measure and method of their cooperation ( <a ref='Acts 15:19–31'>Acts 15:19–31</a> ; <a ref='Acts 20:28'>20:28</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 5:4–7'>1 Cor. 5:4–7</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 5:13'>13</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 5:1–4'>1 Pet. 5:1–4</a> ). We teach that the purpose of the church is to glorify God ( <a ref='Ephesians 3:21'>Eph. 3:21</a> ) by building itself up in the faith ( <a ref='Ephesians 4:13–16'>Eph. 4:13–16</a> ), by instruction of the Word ( <a ref='2 Timothy 2:2'>2 Tim. 2:2</a> , <a ref='2 Timothy 2:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 3:16–17'>3:16–17</a> ), by fellowship ( <a ref='Acts 2:47'>Acts 2:47</a> ; <a ref='1 John 1:3'>1 John 1:3</a> ), by keeping the ordinances ( <a ref='Luke 22:19'>Luke 22:19</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:38–42'>Acts 2:38–42</a> ), and by advancing and communicating the gospel to the entire world ( <a ref='Matthew 28:19'>Matt. 28:19</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:8'>Acts 1:8</a> ). We teach the calling of all saints to the work of service ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:58'>1 Cor. 15:58</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 4:12'>Eph. 4:12</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 22:12'>Rev. 22:12</a> ). We teach the need of the church to cooperate with God as he accomplishes his purpose in the world. To that end, he gives the church spiritual gifts. First, he gives men chosen for the purpose of equipping the saints for the work of the ministry ( <a ref='Ephesians 4:7–12'>Eph. 4:7–12</a> ), and he also gives unique and special spiritual abilities to each member of the body of Christ ( <a ref='Romans 12:5–8'>Rom. 12:5–8</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:4–31'>1 Cor. 12:4–31</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 4:10–11'>1 Pet. 4:10–11</a> ). We teach that there were two kinds of gifts given the early church: miraculous gifts of divine revelation and healing, given temporarily in the apostolic era for the purpose of confirming the authenticity of the apostles’ message ( <a ref='Hebrews 2:3–4'>Heb. 2:3–4</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 12:12'>2 Cor. 12:12</a> ); and ministering gifts, given to equip believers for edifying one another. With the New Testament revelation now complete, Scripture becomes the sole test of the authenticity of a man’s message, and confirming gifts of a miraculous nature are no longer necessary to validate a man or his message ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 13:8–12'>1 Cor. 13:8–12</a> ). Miraculous gifts can even be counterfeited by Satan so as to deceive even believers ( <a ref='Matthew 24:24'>Matt. 24:24</a> ). The only gifts in operation today are those non-revelatory equipping gifts given for edification ( <a ref='Romans 12:6–8'>Rom. 12:6–8</a> ). We teach that no one possesses the gift of healing today but that God does hear and answer the prayer of faith and will answer in accordance with his own perfect will for the sick, suffering, and afflicted ( <a ref='Luke 18:1–8'>Luke 18:1–8</a> ; <a ref='John 5:7–9'>John 5:7–9</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 12:6–10'>2 Cor. 12:6–10</a> ; <a ref='James 5:13–16'>James 5:13–16</a> ; <a ref='1 John 5:14'>1 John 5:14</a> , <a ref='1 John 5:15'>15</a> ). We teach that two ordinances have been committed to the local church: baptism and the Lord’s Supper ( <a ref='Acts 2:38–42'>Acts 2:38–42</a> ). Christian baptism by immersion ( <a ref='Acts 8:36–39'>Acts 8:36–39</a> ) is the solemn and beautiful testimony of a believer showing forth his faith in the crucified, buried, and risen Savior, and his union with him in death to sin and resurrection to a new life ( <a ref='Romans 6:1–11'>Rom. 6:1–11</a> ). It is also a sign of fellowship and identification with the visible body of Christ ( <a ref='Acts 2:41–42'>Acts 2:41–42</a> ). We teach that the Lord’s Supper is the commemoration and proclamation of his death until he comes, and should be always preceded by solemn self-examination ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 11:23–32'>1 Cor. 11:23–32</a> ). We also teach that whereas the elements of Communion are only representative of the flesh and blood of Christ, the Lord’s Supper is nevertheless an actual Communion with the risen Christ who is present in a unique way, fellowshiping with his people ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:16'>1 Cor. 10:16</a> ). Angels Holy Angels We teach that angels are created beings and are therefore not to be worshiped. Although they are a higher order of creation than man, they are created to serve God and to worship him ( <a ref='Luke 2:9–14'>Luke 2:9–14</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 1:6–7'>Heb. 1:6–7</a> , <a ref='Hebrews 1:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 2:6–7'>2:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 5:11–14'>Rev. 5:11–14</a> ). Fallen Angels We teach that Satan is a created angel and the author of sin. He incurred the judgment of God by rebelling against his Creator ( <a ref='Isaiah 14:12–17'>Isa. 14:12–17</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 28:11–19'>Ezek. 28:11–19</a> ), by taking numerous angels with him in his fall ( <a ref='Matthew 25:41'>Matt. 25:41</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:1–14'>Rev. 12:1–14</a> ), and by introducing sin into the human race by his temptation of Eve ( <a ref='Genesis 3:1–15'>Gen. 3:1–15</a> ). We teach that Satan is the open and declared enemy of God and man ( <a ref='Isaiah 14:13–14'>Isa. 14:13–14</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 4:1–11'>Matt. 4:1–11</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:9–10'>Rev. 12:9–10</a> ), that he is the prince of this world who has been defeated through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ ( <a ref='Romans 16:20'>Rom. 16:20</a> ), and that he shall be eternally punished in the lake of fire ( <a ref='Isaiah 14:12–17'>Isa. 14:12–17</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 28:11–19'>Ezek. 28:11–19</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 25:41'>Matt. 25:41</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:10'>Rev. 20:10</a> ). Last Things (Eschatology) Death We teach that physical death involves no loss of our immaterial consciousness ( <a ref='Revelation 6:9–11'>Rev. 6:9–11</a> ), that there is a separation of soul and body ( <a ref='James 2:26'>James 2:26</a> ), that the soul of the redeemed passes immediately into the presence of Christ ( <a ref='Luke 23:43'>Luke 23:43</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:8'>2 Cor. 5:8</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 1:23'>Phil. 1:23</a> ), and that, for the redeemed, such separation will continue until the rapture ( <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:13–17'>1 Thess. 4:13–17</a> ), which initiates the first resurrection ( <a ref='Revelation 20:4–6'>Rev. 20:4–6</a> ), when our soul and body will be reunited to be glorified forever with our Lord ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:35–44'>1 Cor. 15:35–44</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:50–54'>50–54</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:21'>Phil. 3:21</a> ). Until that time, the souls of the redeemed in Christ remain in joyful fellowship with our Lord Jesus Christ ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:8'>2 Cor. 5:8</a> ). We teach the bodily resurrection of all people—the saved to eternal life ( <a ref='John 6:39'>John 6:39</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:10–11'>Rom. 8:10–11</a> , <a ref='Romans 8:19–23'>19–23</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:14'>2 Cor. 4:14</a> ) and the unsaved to judgment and everlasting punishment ( <a ref='Daniel 12:2'>Dan. 12:2</a> ; <a ref='John 5:29'>John 5:29</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:13–15'>Rev. 20:13–15</a> ). We teach that the souls of the unsaved at death are kept under punishment until the final resurrection ( <a ref='Luke 16:19–26'>Luke 16:19–26</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:13–15'>Rev. 20:13–15</a> ), when the soul and the resurrection body will be united ( <a ref='John 5:28–29'>John 5:28–29</a> ). They shall then appear at the great white throne judgment ( <a ref='Revelation 20:11–15'>Rev. 20:11–15</a> ) and shall be cast into hell, the lake of fire ( <a ref='Matthew 25:41–46'>Matt. 25:41–46</a> ), cut off from the life of God forever ( <a ref='Daniel 12:2'>Dan. 12:2</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 25:41–46'>Matt. 25:41–46</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:7–9'>2 Thess. 1:7–9</a> ). The Rapture of the Church We teach the personal, bodily return of our Lord Jesus Christ before the seven-year tribulation ( <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:16'>1 Thess. 4:16</a> ; <a ref='Titus 2:13'>Titus 2:13</a> ) to translate his church from this earth ( <a ref='John 14:1–3'>John 14:1–3</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:51–53'>1 Cor. 15:51–53</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:15–5:11'>1 Thess. 4:15—5:11</a> ) and, between this event and his glorious return with his saints, to reward believers according to their works ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:11–15'>1 Cor. 3:11–15</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:10'>2 Cor. 5:10</a> ). The Tribulation Period We teach that immediately following the removal of the church from the earth ( <a ref='John 14:1–3'>John 14:1–3</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:13–18'>1 Thess. 4:13–18</a> ) the righteous judgments of God will be poured out upon an unbelieving world ( <a ref='Jeremiah 30:7'>Jer. 30:7</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>Dan. 9:27</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 12:1'>12:1</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:7–12'>2 Thess. 2:7–12</a> ; <a ref='Rev 16'>Rev. 16</a> ), and that these judgments will be climaxed by the return of Christ in glory to the earth ( <a ref='Matthew 24:27–31'>Matt. 24:27–31</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 25:31–46'>25:31–46</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:7–12'>2 Thess. 2:7–12</a> ). At that time the Old Testament and tribulation saints will be raised and the living will be judged ( <a ref='Daniel 12:2'>Dan. 12:2</a> , <a ref='Daniel 12:3'>3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:4–6'>Rev. 20:4–6</a> ). This period includes the seventieth week of Daniel’s prophecy ( <a ref='Daniel 9:24–27'>Dan. 9:24–27</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:15–31'>Matt. 24:15–31</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 25:31–46'>25:31–46</a> ). The Second Coming and the Millennial Reign We teach that after the tribulation period, Christ will come to earth to occupy the throne of David ( <a ref='Matthew 25:31'>Matt. 25:31</a> ; <a ref='Luke 1:32–33'>Luke 1:32–33</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:10–11'>Acts 1:10–11</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:29–30'>2:29–30</a> ) and establish his messianic kingdom for a thousand \\\\years on the earth ( <a ref='Revelation 20:1–7'>Rev. 20:1–7</a> ). During this time the resurrected saints will reign with him over Israel and all the nations of the earth ( <a ref='Ezekiel 37:21–28'>Ezek. 37:21–28</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 7:17–22'>Dan. 7:17–22</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:11–16'>Rev. 19:11–16</a> ). This reign will be preceded by the overthrow of the Antichrist and the false prophet, and by the removal of Satan from the world ( <a ref='Daniel 7:17–27'>Dan. 7:17–27</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:1–6'>Rev. 20:1–6</a> ). We teach that the kingdom itself will be the fulfillment of God’s promise to Israel ( <a ref='Isaiah 65:17–25'>Isa. 65:17–25</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 37:21–28'>Ezek. 37:21–28</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 8:1–17'>Zech. 8:1–17</a> ) to restore them to the land which they forfeited through their disobedience ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:15–68'>Deut. 28:15–68</a> ). The result of their disobedience was that Israel was temporarily set aside ( <a ref='Matthew 21:43'>Matt. 21:43</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:1–26'>Rom. 11:1–26</a> ) but will again be awakened through repentance to enter into the land of blessing ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–34'>Jer. 31:31–34</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 36:22–32'>Ezek. 36:22–32</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:25–29'>Rom. 11:25–29</a> ). We teach that this time of our Lord’s reign will be characterized by harmony, justice, peace, righteousness, and long life ( <a ref='Is 11'>Isa. 11</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 65:17–25'>65:17–25</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 36:33–38'>Ezek. 36:33–38</a> ), and will be brought to an end with the release of Satan ( <a ref='Revelation 20:7'>Rev. 20:7</a> ). The Judgment of the Lost We teach that following the release of Satan after the thousand-year reign of Christ ( <a ref='Revelation 20:7'>Rev. 20:7</a> ), Satan will deceive the nations of the earth and gather them to battle against the saints and the beloved city, at which time Satan and his army will be devoured by fire from heaven ( <a ref='Revelation 20:9'>Rev. 20:9</a> ). Following this, Satan will be thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur ( <a ref='Matthew 25:41'>Matt. 25:41</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:10'>Rev. 20:10</a> ) whereupon Christ, who is the judge of all people ( <a ref='John 5:22'>John 5:22</a> ), will resurrect and judge the great and small at the great white throne judgment. We teach that this resurrection of the unsaved dead to judgment will be a physical resurrection, whereupon receiving their judgment ( <a ref='John 5:28–29'>John 5:28–29</a> ), they will be committed to an eternal conscious punishment in the lake of fire ( <a ref='Matthew 25:41'>Matt. 25:41</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:11–15'>Rev. 20:11–15</a> ). Eternity We teach that after the closing of the millennium, the temporary release of Satan, and the judgment of unbelievers ( <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:9'>2 Thess. 1:9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:7–15'>Rev. 20:7–15</a> ), the saved will enter the eternal state of glory with God, after which the elements of this earth are to be dissolved ( <a ref='2 Peter 3:10'>2 Pet. 3:10</a> ) and replaced with a new earth wherein only righteousness dwells ( <a ref='Ephesians 5:5'>Eph. 5:5</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:15'>Rev. 20:15</a> ; <a ref='Rev 21-22'>21–22</a> ). Following this, the heavenly city will come down out of heaven ( <a ref='Revelation 21:2'>Rev. 21:2</a> ) and will be the dwelling place of the saints, where they will enjoy forever fellowship with God and one another ( <a ref='John 17:3'>John 17:3</a> ; <a ref='Rev 21-22'>Rev. 21–22</a> ). Our Lord Jesus Christ, having fulfilled his redemptive mission, will then deliver up the kingdom to God the Father ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:23–28'>1 Cor. 15:23–28</a> ) that in all spheres the triune God may reign forever and ever ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:28'>1 Cor. 15:28</a> ).",
