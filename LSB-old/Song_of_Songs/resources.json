    "content": "The Song of Songs Title The Greek Septuagint (LXX) and Latin Vulgate (Vg.) versions follow the Hebrew (Masoretic Text) with literal translations of the first two words in <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:1'>1:1</a> —“Song of Songs.” Several English versions read “The Song of Songs,” thus giving the fuller sense of <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:1'>1:1</a> . The superlative, “Song of Songs” (cf. “Holy of Holies” in <a ref='Exodus 26:33–34'>Ex 26:33–34</a> and “King of kings” in <a ref='Revelation 19:16'>Rev 19:16</a> ), indicates that this song is the best among Solomon’s 1,005 musical works ( <a ref='1 Kings 4:32'>1Ki 4:32</a> ). The word translated “song” frequently refers to music that honors the Lord (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:31–32'>1Chr 6:31–32</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 33:3'>Pss 33:3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 40:3'>40:3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 144:9'>144:9</a> ). Author and Date Solomon, who reigned over the united kingdom 40 years (971–931 BC), appears 7 times by name in this book ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:1'>1:1</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:5'>5</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:7'>3:7</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:11–12'>8:11–12</a> ). In view of his writing skills, musical giftedness ( <a ref='1 Kings 4:32'>1Ki 4:32</a> ), and the authorial, not dedicatory, sense of <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:1'>1:1</a> , this piece of Scripture could have been penned at any time during Solomon’s reign. Since cities to the north and to the south are spoken of in Solomon’s descriptions and travels, both the period depicted and the time of actual writing point to the united kingdom before it divided after Solomon’s reign ended. Knowing that this portion of Scripture comprises one song by one author, it is best taken as a unified piece of poetic, Wisdom literature rather than a series of love poems without a common theme or author. Background and Setting Two people dominate this true-life, dramatic love song. Solomon, whose kingship is mentioned 5 times ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:4'>1:4</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:9'>3:9</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:5'>7:5</a> ), appears as “the beloved.” The Shulammite maiden ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:13'>6:13</a> ) remains obscure; most likely she was a resident of Shunem, 3 mi. north of Jezreel in lower Galilee. Some suggest she is Pharaoh’s daughter ( <a ref='1 Kings 3:1'>1Ki 3:1</a> ), although the Song provides no evidence for this conclusion. Others favor Abishag, the Shunammite who cared for King David ( <a ref='1 Kings 1:1–4'>1Ki 1:1–4</a> , <a ref='1 Kings 1:15'>15</a> ). An unknown maiden from Shunem, whose family had possibly been employed by Solomon ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:11'>8:11</a> ), seems most reasonable. She would have been Solomon’s first wife ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:9'>Ecc 9:9</a> ), before he sinned by adding 699 other wives and 300 concubines ( <a ref='1 Kings 11:3'>1Ki 11:3</a> ). Minor roles feature several different groups in this book. First, note the not-infrequent commentary by “the daughters of Jerusalem” ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:4'>1:4b</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:8'>8</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:6–11'>3:6–11</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:9'>5:9</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:1'>6:1</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:13'>13a</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:1–5'>7:1–5</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:5'>8:5a</a> ), who might be part of Solomon’s household staff (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:10'>3:10</a> ). Second, the affirmation of <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:1'>5:1b</a> would most likely be God’s blessing on the couple’s union. Third, the Shulammite’s brothers speak ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:8–9'>8:8–9</a> ). The setting combines both rural and urban scenes. Portions take place in the hill country north of Jerusalem, where the Shulammite lived ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:13'>6:13</a> ) and where Solomon enjoyed prominence as a vinegrower and shepherd ( <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:4–7'>Ecc 2:4–7</a> ). The city section includes the wedding and time afterward at Solomon’s abode in Jerusalem ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:6–7:13'>3:6—7:13</a> ). The first spring appears in <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:11–13'>2:11–13</a> and the second in <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:12'>7:12</a> . Assuming a chronology without gaps, the Song of Songs took place over a period of time at least one year in length, but probably no longer than two years. Historical and Theological Themes All 117 verses in Solomon’s Song have been recognized by the Jews as a part of their sacred writings. Along with Ruth, Esther, Ecclesiastes, and Lamentations, it is included among the OT books of the Megilloth, or “five scrolls.” The Jews read this song at Passover, calling it “the Holy of Holies.” Surprisingly, God is not mentioned explicitly except possibly in <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:6'>8:6</a> . No formal theological themes emerge. The NT never quotes Solomon’s Song directly (nor Esther, Obadiah, and Nahum). In contrast to the two distorted extremes of ascetic abstinence and lustful perversion outside of marriage, Solomon’s ancient love song exalts the purity of marital affection and romance. It parallels and enhances other portions of Scripture which portray God’s plan for marriage, including the beauty and sanctity of sexual intimacy between husband and wife. The Song rightfully stands alongside other classic Scripture passages which expand on this theme, e.g., <a ref='Genesis 2:24'>Ge 2:24</a> ; <a ref='Ps 45'>Ps 45</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 5:15–23'>Pr 5:15–23</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 7:1–5'>1Co 7:1–5</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 13:1–8'>13:1–8</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:18–33'>Eph 5:18–33</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 3:18–19'>Col 3:18–19</a> ; and <a ref='1 Peter 3:1–7'>1Pe 3:1–7</a> . <a ref='Hebrews 13:4'>Hebrews 13:4</a> captures the heart of this song, “Marriage <i>is to be held</i> in honor among all, and the <i>marriage</i> bed <i>is to be</i> undefiled, for the sexually immoral and adulterers God will judge.” Interpretive Challenges The Song has suffered strained interpretations over the centuries by those who use the “allegorical” method of interpretation, claiming that this song has no actual historical basis, but rather that it depicts God’s love for Israel and/or Christ’s love for the church. The misleading idea from hymnology that Christ is the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys results from this method ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:1'>2:1</a> ). The “typological” variation admits the historical reality, but concludes that it ultimately pictures Christ’s bridegroom love for His bride the church. A more satisfying way to approach Solomon’s Song is to take it at face value and interpret it in the normal historical sense, understanding the frequent use of poetic imagery to depict reality. To do so understands that Solomon recounts 1) his own days of courtship, 2) the early days of his first marriage, followed by 3) the maturing of this royal couple through the good and bad days of life. The Song of Songs expands on the ancient marriage instructions of <a ref='Genesis 2:24'>Ge 2:24</a> , thus providing spiritual music for a lifetime of marital harmony. It is given by God to demonstrate His intention for the romance and loveliness of marriage, the most precious of human relations and “the grace of life” ( <a ref='1 Peter 3:7'>1Pe 3:7</a> ). The metaphoric and euphemistic nature of this book is designed by God to veil the private intimacy of marriage. Its beautiful expressions of romantic love are purposefully shrouded in poetic language—intended only to give general insight into the joys of passion, desire, and romance. In this way, the Song expresses the wonders of marital love while distancing itself from anything crass or explicitly sensual. Interpreters of this book must be careful to maintain the dignified character of the book and must not read anything into it that is not actually there. Outline I.

This portion most likely represents her remembrances of past events combined with the desires of her heart to marry the king, as she anticipates his arrival to take her to Jerusalem for the wedding in <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:6'>3:6ff.</a> <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:2–3'>1:2–3</a> Four features of Solomon attracted the beloved: 1) his lips, 2) his love, 3) his lotion, and 4) his pure lifestyle.

Rather, she would go as a shepherdess to a shepherd. <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:8'>1:8</a> This could have been spoken by the daughters of Jerusalem. <b>Most beautiful among women.</b> The Shulammite received accolades as the best (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:9'>5:9</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:1'>6:1</a> ). This is reminiscent of the <a ref='Pr 31'>Pr 31</a> woman (v. <a ref='Proverbs 31:29'>29</a> ). Places Named in the Song of Songs Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>my darling.</b> The first of 9 uses ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:15'>1:15</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:2'>2:2</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:13'>13</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:1'>4:1</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:7'>7</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:2'>5:2</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:4'>6:4</a> ) <b>mare of mine.</b> Coming from an accomplished horseman ( <a ref='1 Kings 10:26–29'>1Ki 10:26–29</a> ), this speech figure makes perfect sense as a striking compliment of her dazzling beauty. <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>My beloved.</b> The first of 24 appearances. <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:15'>1:15</a> <b>Behold, you are beautiful!</b> Verbal affirmation fueled this romance. He used “beautiful” at least 10 times ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:15'>1:15</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:10'>2:10</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:13'>13</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:1'>4:1</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:7'>7</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:4'>6:4</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:10'>10</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:6'>7:6</a> ). <b>eyes …</b> like <b>doves.</b> She returned the compliment in <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:12'>5:12</a> , which is best understood as beautiful eyes representing a beautiful personality. <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:16–17'>1:16–17</a> Actually an outdoor setting in the forest. <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:3–6'>2:3–6</a> This scene pictures the loving desire of the Shulammite rather than her actual experience. <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:4'>2:4</a> <b>house of banqueting.</b> The scene continues in the outdoors. This “house of wine” symbolizes the vineyard, just as the beams and rafters of <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:17'>1:17</a> refer to the forest. <b>his banner.</b> As a military flag indicates location or possession, so Solomon’s love flew over his beloved one (cf. <a ref='Numbers 1:52'>Nu 1:52</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 20:5'>Ps 20:5</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>I call you.</b> This refrain, which is repeated before the wedding ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:5'>3:5</a> ) and also afterward ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:4'>8:4</a> ), explicitly expresses her commitment to a chaste life before and during marriage. She invites accountability to the daughters of Jerusalem. <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:11–13'>2:11–13</a> Winter past, rains over, flowers appearing, and vines blooming use springtime as a picture of their robust, growing love for one another. <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:14'>2:14</a> This is best taken as a continuation of what Solomon said as quoted by the Shulammite (vv. <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:10–15'>10–15</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:15'>2:15</a> <b>Seize the foxes.</b> Perhaps, as she literally did in the vineyards, Solomon wanted her to do by analogy in their relationship, i.e., to remove those things in their relationship that would spoil their blossoming love. It could also be thought of as “Let us. …” <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:16'>2:16</a> <b>My beloved is mine, and I am his.</b> This clearly expresses the sanctity of a monogamous relationship that is built on mutual love (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:3'>6:3</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:10'>7:10</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:1–4'>3:1–4</a> As the wedding time approaches, the Shulammite’s expectations grew more intense. It’s best to understand this as her dream, rather than a historical remembrance. <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:1'>3:1</a> <b>whom my soul loves.</b> She repeated this phrase once in each of the first 4 verses, expressing her exclusive love for Solomon. <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:3'>3:3</a> <b>watchmen.</b> This imagined encounter resembles a later real experience (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:6–8'>5:6–8</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:4'>3:4</a> The Shulammite finds Solomon in her dreams and brings him to where she actually resides—her mother’s house. <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:5'>3:5</a> As in <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:7'>2:7</a> , the beloved knows that the intensity of her love for Solomon cannot yet be experienced until the wedding, so she invites the daughters of Jerusalem to keep her accountable regarding sexual purity. Up to this point, the escalating desire of the Shulammite for Solomon has been expressed in veiled and delicate ways as compared to the explicit and open expressions which follow, as would be totally appropriate for a married couple (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:1'>4:1ff.</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:6–5:1'>3:6—5:1</a> This second major section portrays the king actually coming for his bride and their return to Jerusalem ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:6–11'>3:6–11</a> ), the wedding ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:1–7'>4:1–7</a> ), and the couple’s consummation of their union ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:8–5:1'>4:8—5:1</a> ). Unlike the previous section, Solomon does a majority of the speaking (15 of 23 verses). <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:6–11'>3:6–11</a> This narrative would be better understood as spoken by the daughters of Jerusalem who are also called the “daughters of Zion” (v. <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:11'>11</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:1–5:1'>4:1—5:1</a> Until <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:11'>3:11</a> , there has been no hint of a wedding or marriage; thus the scenario of events support the idea that <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:2–3:5'>1:2—3:5</a> refers to premarital days, while <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:1'>4:1ff.</a> rehearses the wedding and their love life that followed. Several reasons support this explanation: 1) “wedding” is not mentioned before <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:11'>3:11</a> ; 2) “bride” does not appear until <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:8'>4:8</a> , and then it is mentioned 6 times from <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:8'>4:8</a> to <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:1'>5:1</a> ; and 3) prior to <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:1'>4:1</a> the beloved has a holy preoccupation with sexual restraint (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:7'>2:7</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:5'>3:5</a> ), but not afterwards in the holy bonds of matrimony. <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:1–15'>4:1–15</a> Possibly Solomon speaks vv. <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:1–7'>1–7</a> in public and the far more intimate words of vv. <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:8–15'>8–15</a> in private as they prepare to consummate their marriage in v. <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:16'>16</a> and <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:1'>5:1</a> . <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:1–7'>4:1–7</a> For other specific descriptions of the Shulammite’s beauty, see <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:4–9'>6:4–9</a> and <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:1–7'>7:1–7</a> . He begins v. <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:1'>1</a> and closes v. <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:7'>7</a> with the same refrain, “you are … beautiful, my darling.” <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:1'>4:1</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:3'>3</a> <b>veil.</b> Not the veil of a prostitute ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:7'>1:7</a> ), but rather the bride. <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:8'>4:8</a> <b>from Lebanon.</b> This figuratively describes the distance that the couple had kept sexually, which is further described in v. <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:12'>12</a> as a locked garden and a sealed spring. <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:9'>4:9</a> <b>my sister.</b> A common ancient Near Eastern term of endearment by a husband for his wife, which expresses closeness and permanence of relationship (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:10'>4:10</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:1–2'>5:1–2</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:15'>4:15</a> <b>a well of fresh water.</b> Solomon testified that whereas she was closed to his physical love before marriage (vv. <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:8'>8</a> , <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:12'>12</a> ), now she is appropriately open to it (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 5:15–20'>Pr 5:15–20</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:16'>4:16</a> The Shulammite then portrays herself as an open garden, whereas before she was closed ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:12'>4:12</a> ). She describes herself as “his garden” signifying voluntary sexual surrender (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 7:3–5'>1Co 7:3–5</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:1'>5:1</a> <b>I have.</b> While the guests feasted, the couple consummated their marriage (cf. <a ref='Genesis 29:23'>Ge 29:23</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 22:13–21'>Dt 22:13–21</a> ) and Solomon announced the blessing (cf. <a ref='Genesis 2:25'>Ge 2:25</a> ). <b>Eat, friends.</b> Given the intimate and private nature of sexual union, it seems difficult to understand anyone but God speaking these words (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 5:21'>Pr 5:21</a> ). This is the divine affirmation of sexual love between husband and wife as holy and beautiful. <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:2–8:14'>5:2—8:14</a> This third major section features the couple’s first argument ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:2–6:3'>5:2—6:3</a> ) and their reconciliation ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:4–8:14'>6:4—8:14</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:2–6:3'>5:2—6:3</a> Inevitable discord comes to even the most idyllic marriage. The “little foxes” of <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:15'>2:15</a> have visited the home in this segment. <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:2'>5:2</a> <b>I was asleep but my heart was awake.</b> Some have suggested the beloved dreams here, as in <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:1–4'>3:1–4</a> . However, she acknowledges “my heart was awake,” indicating that she was not sound asleep. To make this a dream would make the rest of the book a dream, which is highly unlikely. <b>Open to me.</b> It appears that Solomon returned home earlier than expected and wanted to give his bride a romantic surprise. <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:3'>5:3</a> <b>How can I…?</b> Her groggy response to Solomon. <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:4–6'>5:4–6</a> By the time she awakens fully and opens the door, Solomon has departed. <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:7'>5:7</a> Unlike what happened in her dream ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:3'>3:3</a> ), the watchmen treat her badly. Between the darkness and the unfamiliar features of the new bride, this could easily have happened. <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:9'>5:9</a> The wise daughters of Jerusalem twice ask a question that prompts this bride to recall the superlative features of her new husband in vv. <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:10–16'>10–16</a> . <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:10–16'>5:10–16</a> She responds that he is “Lifted up as a banner among ten thousand” which is another way to say, “He is the best of the best.” <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:1'>6:1</a> Having established why they should look ( <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:9'>5:9</a> ), the daughters ask where they should look. <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:2–3'>6:2–3</a> She believed Solomon had gone back to the garden and reaffirmed her exclusive love (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:16'>2:16</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:10'>7:10</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:4–8:4'>6:4—8:4</a> The couple works through their difficulties and rekindles their love. <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:4–9'>6:4–9</a> Apparently a reunion has occurred, and Solomon once again assured her of his love. <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:4'>6:4</a> <b>lovely as Jerusalem.</b> The nation’s capital city was known as “the perfection of beauty, a joy to all the earth” (cf. <a ref='Psalms 48:1–2'>Ps 48:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 2:15'>Lam 2:15</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:8–9'>6:8–9</a> Solomon reaches new heights in telling his bride she remains the best of the best (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:2'>2:2</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 4:7'>4:7</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:2'>5:2</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:8'>6:8</a> <b>queens … concubines … maidens.</b> Are these Solomon’s other women? There is no language of ownership or relationship. The numerical progression from 60 to 80 to “without number” points to the use of various categories for effect only. Solomon tells his beloved that she stands above all women. <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:10'>6:10</a> This is better understood as being said by the daughters of Jerusalem as the third question in a series of 3 (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:9'>5:9</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:1'>6:1</a> ). This time they exalt the Shulammite as one who ranks with the great beauties of God’s creation. <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:11–13'>6:11–13</a> This represents the most difficult portion to interpret in the entire song. <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:11–12'>6:11–12</a> This is best understood as being spoken by the beloved. Solomon acknowledges that when he left home hastily (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:2–6'>5:2–6</a> ), he returned to agricultural (v. <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:11'>11</a> ) and military (v. <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:12'>12</a> ) matters. <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:13'>6:13</a> <b>Come back, come back.</b> This is best understood as being spoken by the daughters of Jerusalem. In effect, they beckon the bride back to the royal palace. <b>Shulammite.</b> A resident of Shunem, a part of the Land allotted to Issachar (cf. <a ref='Joshua 19:18'>Jos 19:18</a> ). <b>Why should you behold.</b> This is best understood as being spoken by the beloved. This probably refers to some form of marital dance associated with the city of Mahanaim which would be inappropriate for anyone other than Solomon to witness. <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:1–5'>7:1–5</a> It is better to understand this as the friends answering Solomon. Verses <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:1'>1</a> and <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:5'>5</a> fit far better this way. <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:1'>7:1</a> <b>O noble’s daughter!</b> She appeared by beauty and dress to be of royal lineage, although she really came from a humble background. <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:6–9'>7:6–9a</a> Solomon and his bride start all over again. He picked up where he left off at <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:2'>5:2</a> . <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:9–8:4'>7:9b–8:4</a> Unlike the response in <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:3'>5:3</a> , this time Solomon’s beloved one responded with reciprocal love. <a ref='Song of Solomon 7:10'>7:10</a> <b>I am my beloved’s.</b> She expressed her loyal love for the third time (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:16'>2:16</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:3'>6:3</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:1'>8:1</a> <b>like a brother to me.</b> This way she could have publicly bestowed her affection without embarrassment. <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:3–4'>8:3–4</a> It will be just as it was when they courted (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 2:6–7'>2:6–7</a> ). This time the restraint involves waiting for lovemaking until they are in private circumstances rather than public. <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:5–14'>8:5–14</a> This final scene portrays the original “marriage encounter” where they reaffirm their love for each other. <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:5'>8:5b</a> <b>I awakened you.</b> This is better understood as being spoken by Solomon. The Shulammite’s dream of <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:4'>3:4</a> has actually been realized now in their marriage. <b>mother.</b> This is the sixth reference to the Shulammite’s mother (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:6'>1:6</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:4'>3:4</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:9'>6:9</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:1'>8:1</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:2'>8:2</a> ). In contrast, Solomon’s mother Bathsheba is mentioned only once (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:11'>3:11</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:6'>8:6</a> <b>seal.</b> The Shulammite is the seal, and Solomon would do the sealing. This represents their publicly declared mutual love for each other. <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:6–7'>8:6–7</a> <b>For love.</b> This represents the <a ref='1 Corinthians 13:1–8'>1Co 13:1–8</a> of the OT. Four qualities of love appear: 1) love is unyielding in marriage, as death is to life; 2) love is intense like the brightest flame, perhaps as bright as the glory of Yahweh; 3) love is invincible or unquenchable, even when flooded by difficulty; and 4) love is so priceless that it cannot be bought, only given away. <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:8–9'>8:8–9</a> The bride’s brothers reminded everyone that they did their brotherly duty of keeping their sister pure before marriage (cf. the brothers of Rebekah in <a ref='Genesis 24:50–60'>Ge 24:50–60</a> ; Dinah in <a ref='Genesis 34:13–27'>Ge 34:13–27</a> ; and Tamar in <a ref='2 Samuel 13:1–22'>2Sa 13:1–22</a> ). The same standard of purity is taught in the NT (cf. <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:1–8'>1Th 4:1–8</a> ). <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:9'>8:9</a> <b>wall … door.</b> Wall represents sexual purity; door portrays an openness to immorality. <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:10'>8:10</a> <b>wall.</b> She reaffirmed that she lived a premarital life of a wall, successfully rebuffing all attempts on her honor. Thus her husband took great delight and contentment in her moral purity. <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:11–12'>8:11–12</a> While Solomon might have leased out his real vineyard for profit, she gave the vineyard of her love to Solomon. <a ref='Song of Solomon 8:13'>8:13</a> My <b>companions.</b> These could be 1) Solomon’s shepherd companions (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 1:7'>1:7</a> ), 2) the daughters of Jerusalem (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 6:13'>6:13</a> ), or 3) those who escorted the bride to Jerusalem (cf. <a ref='Song of Solomon 3:7'>3:7</a> ).",
