That Solomon acquired much through trade is suggested by the response of the queen of Sheba on her visit to Solomon, and by the mention of traders and merchants ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 9:14'>9:14</a> ) in the account of his wealth. Solomon may have fortified Tadmor ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 8:4'>8:4</a> ) in order to have a safe and direct trade route from Asia Minor to Damascus.",

    "content": "The glory of the united kingdom faded after the death of Solomon. Bitter feelings had been aroused by some of the harsh policies of Solomon’s rule. The system of forced labor for building projects ( <a ref='1 Kings 5:13'>1Ki 5:13</a> ) and the administrative districts which cut across old tribal boundaries ( <a ref='1 Kings 4:7–19'>1Ki 4:7–19</a> ) were not popular with the people. When Solomon’s son Rehoboam ascended the throne, he inherited the tension between north and south that had to be addressed if the kingdom was to remain united. At Shechem the people, with Jeroboam as their leader, asked for change. Rehoboam’s harsh rejection of their demands led to the people’s rebellious response: “To your tents, O Israel! Now see to your own house, David!” ( <a ref='1 Kings 12:16'>1Ki 12:16</a> ). The kingdom split, Rehoboam reigned over Judah in the south, and Jeroboam became king of Israel in the north.",

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='2 Chronicles 1:1–9:31'>1:1—9:31</a> This section continues from 1 Chronicles and covers the rule of Solomon (ca. 971–931 BC; cf. <a ref='1Ki 3-11'>1Ki 3–11</a> ). The major theme is Solomon’s building God’s temple in Jerusalem for the purpose of centralizing and unifying the nation in the worship of God. <a ref='2 Chronicles 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>Gibeon.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Chronicles 16:39'>1Chr 16:39</a> and <a ref='1 Chronicles 21:29'>21:29</a> .</i> The tabernacle remained at Gibeon while the ark resided in Jerusalem, waiting for the temple to be built. <b>tent of meeting.</b> Built in the days of Moses, this tent was where God met with the people (cf. <a ref='Exodus 25:22'>Ex 25:22</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 29:42–43'>29:42–43</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 40:34–38'>40:34–38</a> ). The center of worship was there until the temple was built (cf. v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 1:6'>6</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>Kiriath-jearim.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='1 Chronicles 13:5'>1Chr 13:5</a> .</i> <a ref='2 Chronicles 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>Bezalel.</b> The Spirit-enabled craftsman who built the bronze altar for the tabernacle (cf. <a ref='Exodus 31:1–11'>Ex 31:1–11</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 38:1–2'>38:1–2</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 1:7–13'>1:7–13</a> The account is paralleled in <a ref='1 Kings 3:5–15'>1Ki 3:5–15</a> . Every king of Israel needed to heed God’s instructions recorded in <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:14–20'>Dt 17:14–20</a> .

Assuming a shekel weighs .4 oz., this represents 15 lbs. of silver for one chariot. <b>a horse for 150.</b> Assuming the weight is in shekels, this would be about 3.75 lbs. of silver. <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:16'>Deuteronomy 17:16</a> warned against the king’s amassing horses. <b>the Hittites.</b> People, once expelled from Israel, who lived north of Israel and northwest of Syria. <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:1–18'>2:1–18</a> This section reports how Solomon selected men to gather building materials for the temple. This was in addition to the massive supplies stockpiled by David (cf. <a ref='1Ch 22'>1Chr 22</a> , <a ref='1Ch 29'>29</a> ). This section parallels <a ref='1 Kings 5:1–16'>1Ki 5:1–16</a> . <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>house for the name of Yahweh.</b> God’s covenant name, Yahweh or Jehovah (cf. <a ref='Exodus 3:14'>Ex 3:14</a> ), is in mind. David wanted to do this, but was not allowed to do any more than plan and prepare ( <a ref='1Ch 23-26'>1Chr 23–26</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 28:11–13'>28:11–13</a> ), purchase the land ( <a ref='2 Samuel 24:18–25'>2Sa 24:18–25</a> ; <a ref='1Ch 22'>1Chr 22</a> ), and gather the materials ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 22:14–16'>1Chr 22:14–16</a> ). <b>royal palace.</b> See <a ref='1 Kings 7:1–12'>1Ki 7:1–12</a> for details (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 7:11'>2Chr 7:11</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 8:1'>8:1</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:2'>2:2</a> These numbers are repeated in <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:17–18'>2:17–18</a> . <a ref='1 Kings 5:16'>First Kings 5:16</a> records 3,300 overseers, compared to 3,600 in <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:18'>2:18</a> . If, however, the additional supervisors (250 in <a ref='2 Chronicles 8:10'>2Chr 8:10</a> , but 550 in <a ref='1 Kings 9:23'>1Ki 9:23</a> ) are added, then both 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles agree that a total of 3,850 men worked. David had done similarly at an earlier date ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 22:2'>1Chr 22:2</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:3–10'>2:3–10</a> Compare with the contents of <a ref='1 Kings 5:3–6'>1Ki 5:3–6</a> . The differences can be accounted for in much the same way as in the Gospels, by combining the narratives of <a ref='1 Kings 5:3–6'>1Ki 5:3–6</a> and <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:3–10'>2Chr 2:3–10</a> to complete the entire correspondence. <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>send me a wise man.</b> The Israelites were familiar with agriculture, but not metalworking. They needed experts for that. <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:8'>2:8</a> <b>algum.</b> A coniferous tree native to Lebanon. Some identify it as sandalwood, a smooth, expensive red wood that could be polished to a high gloss. <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:10'>2:10</a> This listing of goods is more complete than that of <a ref='1 Kings 5:11'>1Ki 5:11</a> . Lebanon traded with Israel regularly for food. <b>give … 20,000 kors.</b> A kor is the same as a homer and could have measured as much as 7.5 bu., making this amount about 150,000 bu. <b>and 20,000 baths.</b> A bath measured about 6 gal. This would be about 120,000 gal. The 20 kors of “beaten oil” in <a ref='1 Kings 5:11'>1Ki 5:11</a> is most likely not a scribal error but rather a finer grade of oil. <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:11–16'>2:11–16</a> Compare with the context of <a ref='1 Kings 5:7–9'>1Ki 5:7–9</a> . <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:12'>2:12</a> <b>God … who has made heaven and earth.</b> This was the common identification of the true God when pagans spoke of or were told of Him (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:23'>2Chr 36:23</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 1:2'>Ezr 1:2</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 5:11–12'>5:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 6:10'>6:10</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 7:12'>7:12</a> , <a ref='Ezra 7:21'>21</a> , <a ref='Ezra 7:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 10:11–12'>Jer 10:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Acts 4:24'>Ac 4:24</a> ; <a ref='Acts 14:15'>14:15</a> ; <a ref='Acts 17:24–26'>17:24–26</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:16–17'>Col 1:16–17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:1'>Rev 11:1</a> , <a ref='Revelation 11:6'>6</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:13–14'>2:13–14</a> <b>Huram-abi.</b> <a ref='1 Kings 7:14'>First Kings 7:14</a> states that his mother was of the tribe of Naphtali, not Dan, as reported here. This is resolved if she was of Naphtali by birth, but living in the territory of Dan. Or, if his parents were originally from the two tribes, then he could legitimately claim either. He was the parallel to Bezalel, who constructed the tabernacle. <i>See note on <a ref='2 Chronicles 1:5'>2Chr 1:5</a> .</i> <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:16'>2:16</a> <b>Joppa.</b> A major coastal port of Israel. Later, Jonah would sail from Joppa ( <a ref='Jonah 1:3'>Jon 1:3</a> ), and much later Peter would be there to receive God’s call in a vision ( <a ref='Acts 10:5'>Ac 10:5ff.</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:17–18'>2:17–18</a> <i>See note on <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:2'>2Chr 2:2</a> .</i> <a ref='2 Chronicles 3:1–17'>3:1–17</a> Cf. <a ref='1 Kings 6:1–38'>1Ki 6:1–38</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 7:15–22'>7:15–22</a> for amplification and additional material on the building of the temple. <a ref='2 Chronicles 3:1'>3:1</a> <b>threshing floor.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Genesis 22:1–18'>Ge 22:1–18</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 24:18–25'>2Sa 24:18–25</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 21:20–30'>1Chr 21:20–30</a> .</i> <a ref='2 Chronicles 3:2'>3:2</a> <b>second month … fourth year.</b> Ca. Apr.–May, 966 BC (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 6:1'>1Ki 6:1</a> ). The project took 7 years, 6 months to complete ca. Oct.–Nov. 959 BC (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 6:37–38'>1Ki 6:37–38</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 3:3'>3:3</a> <b>cubits … old standard.</b> About 18 in. or possibly the royal cubit of 21 in. (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:5'>Eze 40:5</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 3:6'>3:6</a> <b>Parvaim.</b> An unknown location. <a ref='2 Chronicles 3:8'>3:8</a> <b>gold … 600 talents.</b> Equal to almost 23 tons of gold. <a ref='2 Chronicles 3:9'>3:9</a> <b>fifty shekels.</b> Equal to 1.25 lbs. Most likely, this small amount gilded only the spike heads. <a ref='2 Chronicles 3:10–13'>3:10–13</a> <b>two cherubim of fashioned work.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='1 Kings 6:23'>1Ki 6:23</a> .</i> This free-standing set of cherubim was in addition to the more diminutive set on the ark itself. <a ref='2 Chronicles 3:14'>3:14</a> <b>veil.</b> Cf. <a ref='Exodus 26:31–35'>Ex 26:31–35</a> on the veil of the tabernacle. The veil separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies, which was entered once annually by the High Priest on the Day of Atonement (cf. <a ref='Le 16'>Lv 16</a> ). This highly limited access to the presence of God was eliminated by the death of Christ, when the veil in Herod’s temple was torn in two from top to bottom ( <a ref='Matthew 27:51'>Mt 27:51</a> ). It signified that believers had immediate, full access to God’s presence through their Mediator and High Priest Jesus Christ, who was the perfect, once-for-all sacrifice (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 3:14–16'>Heb 3:14–16</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:19–22'>9:19–22</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 3:15'>3:15</a> <b>thirty-five cubits.</b> <a ref='1 Kings 7:15'>First Kings 7:15</a> , <a ref='2 Kings 25:17'>2Ki 25:17</a> , and <a ref='Jeremiah 52:21'>Jer 52:21</a> uniformly describe these cast-bronze pillars as 18 cubits high (about 27 ft.). Most likely this is accounted for because the chronicler gave the combined height of both as they were lying in their molds (cf. v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 3:17'>17</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 3:17'>3:17</a> <b>Jachin … Boaz.</b> Most likely these were so named because of the names’ meaning rather than in honor of particular people. Jachin means “He shall establish” and Boaz means “In it is strength” (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 7:21'>1Ki 7:21</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 4:1–5:1'>4:1—5:1</a> See <a ref='1 Kings 7:23–51'>1Ki 7:23–51</a> for amplification and additional details. <a ref='2 Chronicles 4:1'>4:1</a> <b>bronze altar.</b> This is the main altar on which sacrifices were offered (cf. the millennial temple altar, <a ref='Ezekiel 43:13–17'>Eze 43:13–17</a> ). For comparison to the tabernacle’s altar, see <a ref='Exodus 27:1–8'>Ex 27:1–8</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 38:1–7'>38:1–7</a> . If the cubit of 18 in. was used rather than the royal cubit of 21 in., it would make the altar 30 ft. by 30 ft. by 15 ft. high. <a ref='2 Chronicles 4:2'>4:2</a> <b>made the sea.</b> This large laver was used for ritual cleansing (cf. <a ref='Exodus 30:17–21'>Ex 30:17–21</a> as it relates to the tabernacle). In Ezekiel’s millennial temple, the laver will apparently be replaced by the waters that flow through the temple ( <a ref='Ezekiel 47:1–12'>Eze 47:1–12</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 4:3'>4:3</a> <b>oxen.</b> <a ref='1 Kings 7:24'>First Kings 7:24</a> reports “gourds,” which is the more likely translation. These were also around the laver, which was set on top of the twelve oxen. <a ref='2 Chronicles 4:4'>4:4</a> <b>twelve oxen.</b> Very likely the twelve oxen represent the twelve tribes who were similarly arrayed around the tabernacle as they set out on their journey in the wilderness (cf. <a ref='Numbers 2:1–34'>Nu 2:1–34</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 4:5'>4:5</a> <b>could hold 3,000 baths.</b> A bath equaled almost 6 gal. <a ref='1 Kings 7:26'>First Kings 7:26</a> reads 2,000 baths. This discrepancy has been reconciled by accounting here not only for the water the basin held, but also the water source that was necessary to keep it flowing as a fountain. <a ref='2 Chronicles 4:6'>4:6</a> <b>ten lavers.</b> There were no such corresponding lavers in the tabernacle. <a ref='2 Chronicles 4:7–8'>4:7–8</a> <b>ten golden lampstands … ten tables.</b> The tabernacle had one of each. Everything was large because of the crowds of thousands that came on a daily basis and for special occasions. <a ref='2 Chronicles 4:11–5:1'>4:11—5:1</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Kings 7:40–51'>1Ki 7:40–51</a> .</i> All these details emphasize the great care and concern for worship, and served as a manual for the new temple being built by Zerubbabel after the Jews returned from Babylon. <a ref='2 Chronicles 4:11'>4:11</a> <b>Huram.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:13–14'>2:13–14</a> .</i> He led the actual work which Solomon directed. <a ref='2 Chronicles 5:1'>5:1</a> The temple took 7 years, 6 months to build and was completed in Solomon’s 11th year (959 BC) in the eighth month (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 6:38'>1Ki 6:38</a> ). Since it was dedicated in the seventh month ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 5:3'>5:3</a> ), its dedication occurred 11 months later to coincide with the Feast of Booths, or Tabernacles. <i>See note on <a ref='1 Kings 8:2'>1Ki 8:2</a> .</i> Why is there so much emphasis in the OT on the temple? 1) It was the center of worship that called people to correct belief through the generations. 2) It was the symbol of God’s presence with His people. 3) It was the symbol of forgiveness and grace, reminding the people of the seriousness of sin and the availability of mercy. 4) It prepared the people for the true Lamb of God, Jesus Christ, who would take away sin. 5) It was a place of prayer. Cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 7:12–17'>7:12–17</a> . <a ref='2 Chronicles 5:2–10'>5:2–10</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Kings 8:1–9'>1Ki 8:1–9</a> .</i> <a ref='2 Chronicles 5:2'>5:2</a> The ark was in Jerusalem in a temporary tent ( <a ref='2 Samuel 6:17'>2Sa 6:17</a> ), not the original tabernacle, which was still at Gibeon ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 16:39'>1Chr 16:39</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 5:11'>5:11</a> <b>the holy place.</b> This was to be the last time anyone but the High Priest went in, and then only once a year. It took several priests to place the ark in its new home. <a ref='2 Chronicles 5:12'>5:12</a> <b>Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='1Ch 25'>1Chr 25</a> .</i> <a ref='2 Chronicles 5:13–14'>5:13–14</a> <b>the glory of Yahweh.</b> Yahweh’s presence indwelt the temple and the first service of worship was held. In the same manner He descended on the tabernacle ( <a ref='Exodus 40:34–38'>Ex 40:34–38</a> ). He will do likewise on the millennial temple ( <a ref='Ezekiel 43:1–5'>Eze 43:1–5</a> ). His glory is representative of His person (cf. <a ref='Ex 33'>Ex 33</a> ), and entering the temple signified His presence. <a ref='2 Chronicles 6:1–11'>6:1–11</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Kings 8:12–21'>1Ki 8:12–21</a> .</i> <a ref='2 Chronicles 6:11'>6:11</a> <b>the covenant of Yahweh.</b> The Mosaic law written on tablets of stone (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 5:10'>5:10</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 6:12–40'>6:12–40</a> <i>See note on <a ref='1 Kings 8:22–53'>1Ki 8:22–53</a> .</i> As Solomon led his people in prayer, he asked God to help them in many situations: 1) crime (vv. <a ref='2 Chronicles 6:22–23'>22–23</a> ); 2) enemy attacks (vv. <a ref='2 Chronicles 6:24–25'>24–25</a> ); 3) drought (vv. <a ref='2 Chronicles 6:26–27'>26–27</a> ); 4) famine (vv. <a ref='2 Chronicles 6:28–31'>28–31</a> ); 5) foreigners (vv. <a ref='2 Chronicles 6:32–33'>32–33</a> ); 6) war (vv. <a ref='2 Chronicles 6:34–35'>34–35</a> ); and 7) sin (vv. <a ref='2 Chronicles 6:36–39'>36–39</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 6:13'>6:13</a> <b>knelt.</b> Solomon, in an unusually humbling act for a king, acknowledged God’s sovereignty. <a ref='2 Chronicles 6:18'>6:18</a> Solomon marveled that God would condescend to live there.

Rehoboam followed foolish and bad advice from novices rather than the good counsel of wise, seasoned men. The result was the division of the nation. Amazingly, with all the strength of Solomon’s reign, unity was fragile, and one fool in the place of leadership ended it. Rehoboam tried to unite the people by force, but was not allowed to by God ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 11:1–4'>11:1–4</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 10:2'>10:2</a> <b>Jeroboam.</b> He became the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel (ca. 931–910 BC).

Ten tribes followed Jeroboam and were called Israel. The other two tribes, Benjamin and Judah, stayed loyal to David’s line, accepted Rehoboam’s rule, and were called Judah. However, Benjamin at times demonstrated split loyalties ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 Kings 12:21'>1Ki 12:21</a></i> ).

He appointed his own idol priests and all true priests moved south and found refuge in Judah with Rehoboam. <a ref='2 Chronicles 11:15'>11:15</a> <b>he set up.</b> This is in reference to Jeroboam (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 12:25–33'>1Ki 12:25–33</a> ), who established idolatry in the north. “Satyrs” is another term for idols (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 17:7'>Lv 17:7</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 11:16–17'>11:16–17</a> God’s blessing rested on Rehoboam for 3 years because the people’s commitment to the ways of God was patterned after David and Solomon. <a ref='2 Chronicles 11:18–23'>11:18–23</a> A summary of Rehoboam’s life is given with special emphasis on succession to the throne. This is not a commendation of polygamy or concubinage, which violated God’s law for marriage (cf. <a ref='Genesis 2:24–25'>Ge 2:24–25</a> ) and resulted in severe trouble and disaffection toward God. Never is polygamy commended in Scripture, and usually its tragic results are recorded. <a ref='2 Chronicles 11:21'>11:21</a> The chronicler did not include the similar summary of Solomon’s wives (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 11:3'>1Ki 11:3</a> ), but clearly Rehoboam learned this disastrous marital style from his father Solomon. Even David was a polygamist. Polygamy was often practiced by the kings to secure alliances with nearby nations. <a ref='2 Chronicles 12:1–2'>12:1–2</a> <b>fifth year.</b> Ca. 926 BC.

An Egyptian record of this invasion written on stone has been found, recording that Shishak’s army penetrated all the way north to the Sea of Galilee. He wanted to restore Egypt’s once-great power, but was unable to conquer both Israel and Judah. However, he was able to destroy cities in Judah and gain some control of trade routes. Judah came under Egyptian control. <a ref='2 Chronicles 12:6–7'>12:6–7</a> <b>humbled themselves.</b> In the face of the Egyptian conqueror, the leaders responded to the Word of God through the prophet (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 12:5'>5</a> ) and repented, so that God would end His wrath worked through Shishak. <a ref='2 Chronicles 12:8'>12:8</a> <b>But.</b> A fitting punishment arose to remind the Jews of their heritage in relationship to Egypt. This was the first major military encounter with Egypt since the Exodus had ended hundreds of years of slavery there. A taste of being enslaved again to a people from whom God had given liberation was bitter. The message was crystal clear—if the Jews would forsake the true worship of God, they would also lose His protective hand of blessing. It was much better to serve God than to have to serve “kingdoms of the countries.” <a ref='2 Chronicles 12:9'>12:9</a> <b>against Jerusalem.</b> After the parenthetical section (vv. <a ref='2 Chronicles 12:5–8'>5–8</a> ) describing the state of the beleaguered court, the historian returns to discuss the attack on Jerusalem and the pillage of the temple and palace. <a ref='2 Chronicles 12:9–16'>12:9–16</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Kings 14:25–30'>1Ki 14:25–30</a> .</i> <a ref='2 Chronicles 12:10–11'>12:10–11</a> <b>bronze.</b> The pure gold was replaced by bronze, which was carefully guarded. <a ref='2 Chronicles 12:12'>12:12</a> Cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 12:7'>12:7</a> .

By the general revival of true worship, Rehoboam’s reign acquired new life and continued many years after the departure of Shishak. Sadly he faltered (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 12:14'>14</a> ), probably due largely to his heathen mother (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 12:13'>13</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 12:16'>12:16</a> <b>Abijah.</b> Cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 11:20'>11:20</a> , <a ref='2 Chronicles 11:22'>22</a> .

But consistent with his pattern, the writer of the Chronicles highlights the little good he did to indicate that he was still in line with God’s covenant promise to David. <a ref='2 Chronicles 13:1–22'>13:1–22</a> In the succession of Judah’s kings, the reign of Abijah/Abijam is next (ca. 913–911 BC; cf. <a ref='1 Kings 15:1–8'>1Ki 15:1–8</a> ). The disobedient nature of Abijah’s reign is mentioned in <a ref='1 Kings 15:3'>1Ki 15:3</a> , as is his faithless treaty with Syria ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 16:3'>2Chr 16:3</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 13:3'>13:3</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Kings 15:1–8'>1Ki 15:1–8</a> .</i> These numbers are large, but not surprising, given the immense number of capable men who could fight, as counted in David’s census (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 21:5'>1Chr 21:5</a> ). Both armies were set for civil war. <a ref='2 Chronicles 13:4'>13:4</a> <b>Mount Zemaraim.</b> The exact location is unknown, but it is likely near Bethel ( <a ref='Joshua 18:22'>Jos 18:22</a> ) inside Israel’s territory. <a ref='2 Chronicles 13:5'>13:5</a> <b>covenant of salt.</b> Salt is associated elsewhere with the Mosaic Covenant sacrifices ( <a ref='Leviticus 2:13'>Lv 2:13</a> ), the Priestly Covenant ( <a ref='Numbers 18:19'>Nu 18:19</a> ), and the New Covenant symbolic sacrifices in the millennial kingdom ( <a ref='Ezekiel 43:24'>Eze 43:24</a> ). The preservative quality of salt represents the fidelity or loyalty intended in keeping the covenant. Here it would refer to God’s irrevocable pledge and intended loyalty in fulfilling the Davidic Covenant and God’s desire for the loyalty of David’s lineage to Him if the people are to enjoy the blessings of the covenant. <a ref='2 Chronicles 13:6'>13:6</a> For the story of Jeroboam, read <a ref='1 Kings 11:26–40'>1Ki 11:26–40</a> and <a ref='2Ch 10'>2Chr 10</a> .

Israel was full of idols and false priests, having driven out all the Levitical priests and, with them, the true worship of God. <a ref='2 Chronicles 13:10–12'>13:10–12</a> Abijah confessed a national commitment to pure worship and thus confidence in God’s favor in battle. <a ref='2 Chronicles 13:15'>13:15</a> <b>God smote Jeroboam and all Israel.</b> At the time of certain defeat, with 400,000 troops behind and the same number in front, Judah was saved by divine intervention. What God did is unknown, but the army of Israel began to flee (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 13:16'>16</a> ), and the soldiers of Judah massacred 500,000 of them in an unimaginable blood bath (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 13:17'>17</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 13:17'>13:17</a> Before the battle, Jeroboam outnumbered Abijah two to one ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 13:3'>13:3</a> ).

Times of peace were used for strengthening. <a ref='2 Chronicles 14:3–5'>14:3–5</a> He removed elements of false worship that had accumulated over the years of Solomon, Rehoboam, and Abijah (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 15:12–13'>1Ki 15:12–13</a> ). Apparently, he did not remove all the high places or, once removed, they reappeared (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 15:17'>15:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 15:14'>1Ki 15:14</a> ). His son Jehoshaphat later had to remove them (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 17:6'>2Chr 17:6</a> ), although not completely (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:33'>20:33</a> ). This was done in an effort to comply with <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:2–3'>Dt 12:2–3</a> . <a ref='2 Chronicles 14:8'>14:8</a> Asa had an army of 580,000 compared to Abijah’s 400,000 ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 13:3'>2Chr 13:3</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 14:9–15'>14:9–15</a> A major threat developed from Zerah, the Ethiopian, probably on behalf of the Egyptian Pharaoh, who was attempting to regain control as Shishak had during the days of Rehoboam (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 12:7–8'>2Chr 12:7–8</a> ), ca. 901–900 BC. <a ref='2 Chronicles 14:9'>14:9</a> <b>Mareshah.</b> Located about 8 mi. southeast of Gath and 25 mi. southwest of Jerusalem.

However, if the time reference was to the 35th year since the kingdom was divided, then the year is ca. 896 BC in the 14th year of Baasha’s reign and the 16th of Asa’s reign. This manner of reckoning was generally followed in the book of the record of the kings of Judah and Israel, the public annals of that time, from which the inspired writer drew his account (cf. v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 16:11'>11</a> ). This could be a cause for the defections of people from Israel to Judah as described in <a ref='2 Chronicles 15:9'>2Chr 15:9</a> .

It should be noted that the Jews needed animals for extensive sacrificial uses, as much as for food and clothing. <a ref='2 Chronicles 17:12–13'>17:12–13</a> These verses indicate the massive wealth that developed under divine blessing (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 18:1'>18:1</a> ), as well as formidable military power (vv. <a ref='2 Chronicles 17:14–19'>14–19</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 18:1–34'>18:1–34</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Kings 22:1–39'>1Ki 22:1–39</a> .</i> Ahab was king in Israel. Jehoshaphat arranged for his son (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 21:6'>21:6</a> ) to marry Athaliah, daughter of wicked Ahab, then made a military alliance with him. This folly had tragic results: 1) Jehoshaphat drew God’s wrath ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 19:2'>19:2</a> ); 2) after Jehoshaphat died and Athaliah became queen, she seized the throne and almost killed all of David’s descendants ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 22:10'>22:10ff.</a> ); and 3) she brought the wicked idols of Israel into Judah, which eventually led to the nation’s destruction and captivity in Babylon. Jehoshaphat had a tendency to rely on other kings as evidenced by this unique report of a marriage alliance with Ahab (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 18:1'>1</a> ). See also <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:35–37'>2Chr 20:35–37</a> concerning an alliance with Ahaziah (ca. 853–852 BC). <a ref='2 Chronicles 18:5'>18:5</a> Evil kings had false prophets who told them what they wanted to hear (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 30:10–11'>Is 30:10–11</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 14:13–16'>Jer 14:13–16</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:16'>23:16</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 23:21'>21</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 23:30–36'>30–36</a> ).

The prophet condemned the king’s alliance with God’s enemy, Ahab ( <a ref='1 Kings 22:2'>1Ki 22:2</a> ), yet there was mercy mingled with wrath because of the king’s concern personally and nationally for the true worship of God. <a ref='2 Chronicles 19:2'>19:2</a> <b>Hanani.</b> This same prophet had earlier given Jehoshaphat’s father, Asa, a similar warning ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 16:7–9'>2Chr 16:7–9</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 19:4–11'>19:4–11</a> Jehoshaphat put God’s kingdom in greater spiritual order than at any time since Solomon. To ensure this order, he set “judges” (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 19:5'>5</a> ) in place and gave them principles to rule by: 1) accountability to God (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 19:6'>6</a> ); 2) integrity and honesty (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 19:7'>7</a> ); 3) loyalty to God (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 19:9'>9</a> ); 4) concern for righteousness (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 19:10'>10</a> ); and 5) courage (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 19:11'>11</a> ). All are essentials to spiritual leadership. <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:1–2'>20:1–2</a> The offspring of Lot, i.e., Moab and Ammon, located east of the Jordan, and those from Edom to the south (the offspring of Esau), had intentions of dethroning Jehoshaphat. They had come around the south end of the Dead Sea as far north as Engedi, at the middle of the western shore. This was a common route for enemies since they were invisible to the people on the other side of the mountains to the west. <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:3–4'>20:3–4</a> Jehoshaphat made the appropriate spiritual response, i.e., the king and the nation appealed to God in prayer and fasting. The fast was national, including even the children (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:13'>13</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Joel 2:12–17'>Joel 2:12–17</a> ; <a ref='Jonah 3:7'>Jon 3:7</a> . <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:5–12'>20:5–12</a> Jehoshaphat stood in the redecorated center court praying for the nation, appealing to the promises, the glory, and the reputation of God which were at stake since He was identified with Judah. In his prayer he acknowledged God’s sovereignty (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:6'>6</a> ), God’s covenant (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:7'>7</a> ), God’s presence (vv. <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:8–9'>8–9</a> ), God’s goodness (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:10'>10</a> ), God’s possession (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:11'>11</a> ), and their utter dependence on Him (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:12'>12</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:10'>20:10</a> <b>Mount Seir.</b> A prominent landmark in Edom. <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:14–17'>20:14–17</a> Yahweh responded immediately, sending a message of confidence through the prophet Jahaziel. <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:16'>20:16</a> <b>ascent of Ziz … wilderness of Jeruel.</b> These areas lie between Engedi on the Dead Sea and Tekoa, which is 10 mi. south of Jerusalem and 17 mi. northwest of Engedi.

Some think this may have been done by angels who appeared and set off this uncontrolled and deadly panic. The destruction was complete before Jehoshaphat and his army ever met the enemy (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:24'>24</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:25–28'>20:25–28</a> They went back just as they had gone out—with music (cf. vv. <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:21–22'>21–22</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:29'>20:29</a> This is the second time in Jehoshaphat’s reign that fear came on the nations (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 17:10'>2Chr 17:10</a> ), which was similar to that when Israel came out of Egypt ( <a ref='Exodus 23:27'>Ex 23:27</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 22:3'>Nu 22:3</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 2:9–11'>Jos 2:9–11</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 9:9–10'>9:9–10</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:31–21:3'>20:31—21:3</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Kings 22:41–49'>1Ki 22:41–49</a> .</i> <a ref='2 Chronicles 21:2–5'>21:2–5</a> When the co-regency with his father ended at his father’s death, Jehoram killed all who might have threatened his throne. <a ref='2 Chronicles 21:4–20'>21:4–20</a> The reign of Jehoram (ca. 853–841 BC).

They had not learned from Solomon’s sinful example (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 11:3–4'>1Ki 11:3–4</a> ). His wicked wife, Athaliah, later became ruler over Judah and tried to wipe out David’s royal line ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 22:10'>2Chr 22:10</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 21:12–15'>21:12–15</a> Elijah, best known for his confrontations with Israel’s Ahab and Jezebel ( <a ref='1Ki 17-2Ki 2:11'>1Ki 17-2Ki 2:11</a> ), confronted prophetically Jehoram’s sins of idolatry and murder ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 21:13'>21:13</a> ). The consequences from God’s judgment extended beyond himself to his family and the nation ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 21:14–15'>21:14–15</a> ). This event undoubtedly occurred in the early years of Jehoram’s co-regency with his father Jehoshaphat and shortly before Elijah’s departure to heaven, ca. 848 BC (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 2:11–12'>2Ki 2:11–12</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 21:16–20'>21:16–20</a> The consequences of his sin were far-reaching.

Disobedience to God’s requirements in this matter surely contributed to the decline under the next king, Amon (vv. <a ref='2 Chronicles 33:21–25'>21–25</a> ), whose corruption his successor, Josiah, had to eliminate ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 34:3–7'>34:3–7</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 33:14'>33:14</a> A wall running from south of the temple and Ophel (west of the Kidron Valley) southeast/northwest reaching to the Fish Gate, northwest of the temple. <a ref='2 Chronicles 33:18–20'>33:18–20</a> See <a ref='2 Kings 21:17–18'>2Ki 21:17–18</a> . <a ref='2 Chronicles 33:21–25'>33:21–25</a> The reign of Amon (ca. 642–640 BC).

Cf. <a ref='2 Kings 22:1–23:30'>2Ki 22:1—23:30</a> . Jeremiah prophesied during this reign ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:24'>2Chr 35:24</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 1:2'>Jer 1:2</a> ) as did Habakkuk, Zephaniah ( <a ref='Zephaniah 1:1'>Zep 1:1</a> ), and Nahum. <a ref='2 Chronicles 34:1–2'>34:1–2</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='2 Kings 22:1–2'>2Ki 22:1–2</a> .</i> At the age of 16, Josiah began to cultivate a love for God in his heart, and by age 20 his character was strong enough in devotion to Him that he went into action to purge his nation. <a ref='2 Chronicles 34:3–7'>34:3–7</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='2 Kings 23:4–20'>2Ki 23:4–20</a> .</i> <a ref='2 Chronicles 34:8'>34:8</a> <b>repair the house of Yahweh.</b> During the 55-year reign of Manasseh ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 33:1'>33:1</a> ) and the two-year reign of Amon ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 33:21'>33:21</a> ), the work of Hezekiah on the temple restoration was undone, which called for another extensive enterprise to “restore and repair” it (vv. <a ref='2 Chronicles 34:9–13'>9–13</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 34:8–13'>34:8–13</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='2 Kings 22:3–7'>2Ki 22:3–7</a> .</i> <a ref='2 Chronicles 34:8–33'>34:8–33</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='2 Kings 22:8–23:20'>2Ki 22:8—23:20</a> .</i> <a ref='2 Chronicles 34:33'>34:33</a> <b>Throughout his lifetime.</b> This noble king had a life-long influence by the power of his godly life and firm devotion to God and His Word. The strength of his character held the nation together serving Yahweh. It started because as a young man he “began to seek … God” (cf. v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 34:3'>3</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:1–19'>35:1–19</a> The chronicler, probably Ezra, gave much more attention to this Passover celebration than does <a ref='2 Kings 23:21–23'>2Ki 23:21–23</a> . <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:1–2'>35:1–2</a> Obviously, the temple’s contents had been disturbed and the sacrifices/festivals interrupted by lack of attention, idolatrous practices, and foreign intervention. As Hezekiah had restored the Passover in his time ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 30:1'>30:1ff.</a> ), so did Josiah. This was the central feast in devotion to Yahweh ( <a ref='Ex 12-13'>Ex 12–13</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:3'>35:3</a> <b>the holy ark.</b> The ark of the covenant which was to remain in the Most Holy Place had been removed, probably by Manasseh, who set a carved image in its place (cf. <a ref='2 Chronicles 33:7'>33:7</a> ). The law for the carrying of the ark during the tabernacle days, when it was portable, called for poles to be placed through rings on the sides, and Levites (Kohathites) to carry it by the poles without touching it (cf. <a ref='Exodus 25:14–15'>Ex 25:14–15</a> ). Uzza(h) died for touching the ark while he was improperly transporting the ark on a cart ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 13:6–10'>1Chr 13:6–10</a> ). Now that the temple was built and the ark had a permanent place, it no longer needed to be transported in the old way. <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:6'>35:6</a> <b>Moses.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Ex 12-13'>Ex 12–13</a> .</i> The prescribed pattern for the Passover in the temple was followed (vv. <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:7–17'>7–17</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:18'>35:18</a> <b>not. … Passover like it.</b> Hezekiah’s Passover (cf. <a ref='2Ch 30'>2Chr 30</a> ) differed. It was not celebrated strictly according to Mosaic law in that: 1) it was celebrated in the second month ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 30:2'>2Chr 30:2</a> ); 2) not all the people were purified ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 30:18'>2Chr 30:18</a> ); and 3) not all of the people came ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 30:10'>2Chr 30:10</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:18–19'>35:18–19</a> <b>from … Samuel.</b> Ca. 1100–1015 BC. It had been over 400 years, since before all the kings of Israel and Judah. <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:20–27'>35:20–27</a> The details of Josiah’s tragic death are given. When compared with the account in <a ref='2 Kings 23:28–30'>2Ki 23:28–30</a> , the events become clearer. Toward the end of Josiah’s reign, the Egyptian Pharaoh Neco (ca. 609–594 BC) set out on a military expedition to aid the king of Assyria in a war at Carchemish, Assyria’s latest capital, 250 mi. northeast of Damascus on the bank of the Euphrates River. Fearing such an alliance would present future danger to Israel, Josiah decided to intercept Pharaoh Neco’s army and fight to protect his nation. Coming from Egypt, likely by ship to Acco, a northern seaport in Israel, and by land up the coastal plain of Israel, the Egyptian army had landed and proceeded east to the plain of Megiddo (v. <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:22'>22</a> ), i.e., Jezreel on the plain of Esdraelon. This was the most direct way to Carchemish. There Josiah met him for battle and was wounded by an arrow. He made it back to Jerusalem (60 mi. south), where he died. <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:21'>35:21</a> <b>God has said for me.</b> He is referring to the true God; whether he had a true revelation or not is unknown. Josiah had no way to know either, and it is apparent he did not believe that Neco spoke the Word of God. There is no reason to assume his death was punishment for refusing to believe. He probably thought Neco was lying and, once victorious with Assyria over Babylon, they would together be back to assault Israel. <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:25'>35:25</a> There is no record of Jeremiah’s elegy. The people continued to mourn the loss of Josiah up to the writing of the Chronicles in 450–430 BC, nearly 200 years after the event. In fact, the location of the battle, the town of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo, was part of a proverb lamenting Josiah’s death even in Zechariah’s day ( <a ref='Zechariah 12:11'>Zec 12:11</a> ), 90 years later. <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:1–4'>36:1–4</a> The reign of Joahaz (ca. 609 BC). Cf. <a ref='2 Kings 23:31–33'>2Ki 23:31–33</a> . Jeremiah continued to prophesy during this reign ( <a ref='Jeremiah 1:3'>Jer 1:3</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:5–8'>36:5–8</a> The reign of Jehoiakim, a.k.a. Eliakim (ca. 609–597 BC; cf. <a ref='2 Kings 23:34–24:7'>2Ki 23:34—24:7</a> ). <i>See notes on <a ref='2 Kings 23:34–24:7'>2Ki 23:34—24:7</a> .</i> Daniel was taken captive to Babylon in 605 BC.

Ezekiel received his commission during this reign ( <a ref='Ezekiel 1:1'>Eze 1:1</a> ) and prophesied from 592 BC to his death in 560 BC. <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:11–20'>36:11–20</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='2 Kings 24:17–25:21'>2Ki 24:17—25:21</a> .</i> <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:20'>36:20</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='2 Kings 25:22–30'>2Ki 25:22–30</a></i> for the fate of those who remained behind in Jerusalem. <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:21'>36:21</a> <b>sabbaths.</b> This suggests that the every seventh year Sabbath which God required for the land ( <a ref='Leviticus 25:1–7'>Lv 25:1–7</a> ) had not been kept for 490 years dating back to the days of Eli, ca. 1107–1067 BC (cf. <a ref='1Sa 1-4'>1Sa 1–4</a> ). <a ref='Leviticus 26:27–46'>Leviticus 26:27–46</a> warns of God’s judgment in general if this law were to be violated. <a ref='Jeremiah 25:1–11'>Jeremiah 25:1–11</a> applied this judgment to Judah from 605 BC at the time of the first Babylonian deportation until 536 BC when the first Jews returned to Jerusalem and started to rebuild the temple (cf. <a ref='Ezra 3:8'>Ezr 3:8</a> ). <a ref='2 Chronicles 36:22–23'>36:22–23</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Ezra 1:1–3'>Ezr 1:1–3</a> .</i> The chronicler ended with a ray of hope because the 70 years were completed (cf. <a ref='Daniel 9:1–2'>Da 9:1–2</a> ) and Abraham’s offspring were returning to the Land to rebuild the temple.",
