    "content": "The Acts of the Apostles Title As the second book Luke addressed to Theophilus (see <a ref='Luke 1:3'>Lk 1:3</a> ), Acts may originally have had no title. The Greek manuscripts title it “Acts,” and many add “of the Apostles.” The Greek word translated “Acts” ( <i>praxeis</i> ) was often used to describe the achievements of great men. Acts does feature the notable figures in the early years of the church, especially Peter (chaps. <a ref='Ac 1-12'>1–12</a> ) and Paul (chaps. <a ref='Ac 13-28'>13–28</a> ). But the book could more properly be called “The Acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles,” since His sovereign, superintending work was far more significant than that of any man. It was the Spirit’s directing, controlling, and empowering ministry that strengthened the church and caused it to grow in numbers, spiritual power, and influence. Author and Date Since Luke’s Gospel was the first book addressed to Theophilus ( <a ref='Luke 1:3'>Lk 1:3</a> ), it is logical to conclude that Luke is also the author of Acts, although he is not named in either book. The writings of the early church fathers such as Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen, Eusebius, and Jerome affirm Luke’s authorship, and so does the Muratorian Canon (ca. AD 170). Because he is a relatively obscure figure, mentioned only 3 times in the NT ( <a ref='Colossians 4:14'>Col 4:14</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 4:11'>2Ti 4:11</a> , <a ref='Philemon 1:24'>Phm 24</a> ), it is unlikely that anyone would have forged a work to make it appear to be Luke’s. A forger surely would have attributed his work to a more prominent person. Luke was Paul’s close friend, traveling companion, and personal physician ( <a ref='Colossians 4:14'>Col 4:14</a> ). He was a careful researcher ( <a ref='Luke 1:1–4'>Lk 1:1–4</a> ) and an accurate historian, displaying an intimate knowledge of Roman laws and customs, as well as the geography of Israel, Asia Minor, and Italy. In writing Acts, Luke drew on written sources ( <a ref='Acts 15:23–29'>15:23–29</a> ; <a ref='Acts 23:26–30'>23:26–30</a> ), and also no doubt interviewed key figures, such as Peter, John, and others in the Jerusalem church. Paul’s two-year imprisonment at Caesarea ( <a ref='Acts 24:27'>24:27</a> ) gave Luke ample opportunity to interview Philip and his daughters (who were considered important sources of information on the early days of the church). Finally, Luke’s frequent use of the first person plural pronouns “we” and “us” ( <a ref='Acts 16:10–17'>16:10–17</a> ; <a ref='Acts 20:5–21:18'>20:5—21:18</a> ; <a ref='Acts 27:1–28:16'>27:1—28:16</a> ) reveals that he was an eyewitness to many of the events recorded in Acts. Some believe Luke wrote Acts after the fall of Jerusalem (AD 70; his death was probably in the mid-eighties). It is more likely, however, that he wrote much earlier, before the end of Paul’s first Roman imprisonment (ca. AD 60–62). That date is the most natural explanation for the abrupt ending of Acts—which leaves Paul awaiting trial before Caesar. Surely Luke, who devoted more than half of Acts to Paul’s ministry, would have given the outcome of that trial, and described Paul’s subsequent ministry, second imprisonment (cf. <a ref='2 Timothy 4:11'>2Ti 4:11</a> ), and death, if those events had happened before he wrote Acts. Luke’s silence about such notable events as the martyrdom of James, head of the Jerusalem church (AD 62 according to the Jewish historian Josephus), the persecution under Nero (AD 64), and the fall of Jerusalem (AD 70) also suggests he wrote Acts before those events transpired. Background and Setting As Luke makes clear in the prologue to his Gospel, he wrote to give Theophilus (and the others who would read his work) an “account of the things” ( <a ref='Luke 1:1'>Lk 1:1</a> ) which Jesus had accomplished during His earthly ministry. Accordingly, Luke’s Gospel records those momentous events “in orderly sequence” ( <a ref='Luke 1:3'>Lk 1:3</a> ). Acts continues that record, noting what Jesus accomplished through the early church. Beginning with Jesus’ ascension, through the birth of the church on the Day of Pentecost, to Paul’s preaching at Rome, Acts chronicles the spread of the gospel and the growth of the church (cf. <a ref='Acts 1:15'>1:15</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:41'>2:41</a> , <a ref='Acts 2:47'>47</a> ; <a ref='Acts 4:4'>4:4</a> ; <a ref='Acts 5:14'>5:14</a> ; <a ref='Acts 6:7'>6:7</a> ; <a ref='Acts 9:31'>9:31</a> ; <a ref='Acts 12:24'>12:24</a> ; <a ref='Acts 13:49'>13:49</a> ; <a ref='Acts 16:5'>16:5</a> ; <a ref='Acts 19:20'>19:20</a> ). It also records the mounting opposition to the gospel (cf. <a ref='Acts 2:13'>2:13</a> ; <a ref='Acts 4:1–22'>4:1–22</a> ; <a ref='Acts 5:17–42'>5:17–42</a> ; <a ref='Acts 6:9–8:4'>6:9—8:4</a> ; <a ref='Acts 12:1–5'>12:1–5</a> ; <a ref='Acts 13:6–12'>13:6–12</a> , <a ref='Acts 13:45–50'>45–50</a> ; <a ref='Acts 14:2–6'>14:2–6</a> , <a ref='Acts 14:19–20'>19–20</a> ; <a ref='Acts 16:19–24'>16:19–24</a> ; <a ref='Acts 17:5–9'>17:5–9</a> ; <a ref='Acts 19:23–41'>19:23–41</a> ; <a ref='Acts 21:27–36'>21:27–36</a> ; <a ref='Acts 23:12–21'>23:12–21</a> ; <a ref='Acts 28:24'>28:24</a> ). Theophilus, whose name means “lover of God,” is unknown to history apart from his mention in Luke and Acts. Whether he was a believer whom Luke was instructing, or a pagan whom Luke sought to convert is not known. Luke’s address of him as “most excellent Theophilus” ( <a ref='Luke 1:3'>Lk 1:3</a> ) suggests he was a Roman official of some importance (cf. <a ref='Acts 24:3'>Ac 24:3</a> ; <a ref='Acts 26:25'>26:25</a> ). Historical and Theological Themes As the first work of church history ever penned, Acts records the initial response to the Great Commission ( <a ref='Matthew 28:19–20'>Mt 28:19–20</a> ). It provides information on the first 3 decades of the church’s existence—material found nowhere else in the NT. Though not primarily a doctrinal work, Acts nonetheless emphasizes that Jesus of Nazareth was Israel’s long-awaited Messiah, shows that the gospel is offered to all men (not merely the Jewish people), and stresses the work of the Holy Spirit (mentioned more than 50 times). Acts also makes frequent use of the OT: e.g., <a ref='Acts 2:17–21'>2:17–21</a> ( <a ref='Joel 2:28–32'>Joel 2:28–32</a> ); <a ref='Acts 2:25–28'>2:25–28</a> ( <a ref='Psalms 16:8–11'>Ps 16:8–11</a> ); <a ref='Acts 2:35'>2:35</a> ( <a ref='Psalms 110:1'>Ps 110:1</a> ); <a ref='Acts 4:11'>4:11</a> ( <a ref='Psalms 118:22'>Ps 118:22</a> ); <a ref='Acts 4:25–26'>4:25–26</a> ( <a ref='Psalms 2:1–2'>Ps 2:1–2</a> ); <a ref='Acts 7:49–50'>7:49–50</a> ( <a ref='Isaiah 66:1–2'>Is 66:1–2</a> ); <a ref='Acts 8:32–33'>8:32–33</a> ( <a ref='Isaiah 53:7–8'>Is 53:7–8</a> ); <a ref='Acts 28:26–27'>28:26–27</a> ( <a ref='Isaiah 6:9–10'>Is 6:9–10</a> ). Acts abounds with transitions: from the ministry of Jesus to that of the apostles; from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant; from Israel as God’s witness nation to the church (composed of both Jews and Gentiles) as God’s witness people. The book of Hebrews sets forth the theology of the transition from the Old Covenant to the New; Acts depicts the New Covenant’s practical outworking in the life of the church. Interpretive Challenges Because Acts is primarily a historical narrative, not a theological treatise like Romans or Hebrews, it contains relatively few interpretive challenges. Those that exist mainly concern the book’s transitional nature (see Historical and Theological Themes) and involve the role of signs and wonders. Those issues are addressed in the notes to the relevant passages (e.g., <a ref='Acts 2:1–47'>2:1–47</a> ; <a ref='Acts 15:1–29'>15:1–29</a> ). Outline I.

That account chronicled the life and teaching of Jesus, through His death, resurrection, and ascension ( <a ref='Luke 24:51'>Lk 24:51</a> ). <b>Theophilus.</b> The original recipient of this book. <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 1:3'>Lk 1:3</a> .</i> <b>all that Jesus began to do and teach.</b> Jesus taught the disciples by word and deed the truth necessary to carry on His work.

Luke uses this term 3 other times (vv. <a ref='Acts 1:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Acts 1:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Acts 1:22'>22</a> ) to describe the end of the Lord’s earthly ministry (cf. <a ref='John 6:62'>Jn 6:62</a> ; <a ref='John 13:1'>13:1</a> , <a ref='John 13:3'>3</a> ; <a ref='John 16:28'>16:28</a> ; <a ref='John 17:13'>17:13</a> ; <a ref='John 20:17'>20:17</a> ). <b>by the Holy Spirit given orders.</b> The Spirit was the source and power of Jesus’ earthly ministry (cf. <a ref='Matthew 4:1'>Mt 4:1</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 12:18'>12:18</a> ; <a ref='Mark 1:12'>Mk 1:12</a> ; <a ref='Luke 3:22'>Lk 3:22</a> ; <a ref='Luke 4:1'>4:1</a> , <a ref='Luke 4:14'>14</a> , <a ref='Luke 4:18'>18</a> ) and of the apostles’ service (cf. <a ref='Luke 24:49'>Lk 24:49</a> ; <a ref='John 14:16–17'>Jn 14:16–17</a> ; <a ref='John 16:7'>16:7</a> ). “Orders” or commandments are authoritative NT truths, revealed to the apostles (cf. <a ref='John 14:26'>Jn 14:26</a> ; <a ref='John 16:13–15'>16:13–15</a> ). <b>He had chosen.</b> The Lord sovereignly chose the apostles for salvation and service (cf. <a ref='John 6:70'>Jn 6:70</a> ; <a ref='John 15:16'>15:16</a> ). <a ref='Acts 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>presented Himself … by many convincing proofs.</b> Cf. <a ref='John 20:30'>Jn 20:30</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:5–8'>1Co 15:5–8</a> . To give the apostles confidence to present His message, Jesus entered a locked room ( <a ref='John 20:19'>Jn 20:19</a> ), showed His crucifixion wounds ( <a ref='Luke 24:39'>Lk 24:39</a> ), and ate and drank with the disciples ( <a ref='Luke 24:41–43'>Lk 24:41–43</a> ). <b>forty days.</b> The time period between Jesus’ resurrection and ascension during which He appeared at intervals to the apostles and others ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:5–8'>1Co 15:5–8</a> ) and provided convincing evidence of His resurrection. <b>kingdom of God.</b> Cf. <a ref='Acts 8:12'>8:12</a> ; <a ref='Acts 14:22'>14:22</a> ; <a ref='Acts 19:8'>19:8</a> ; <a ref='Acts 20:25'>20:25</a> ; <a ref='Acts 28:23'>28:23</a> , <a ref='Acts 28:31'>31</a> . Here this expression refers to the sphere of salvation, the gracious domain of divine rule over believers’ hearts ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:9'>1Co 6:9</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:5'>Eph 5:5</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Acts 17:7'>17:7</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:13–14'>Col 1:13–14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:15'>Rev 11:15</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:10'>12:10</a> ). This was the dominant theme during Christ’s earthly ministry (cf. <a ref='Matthew 4:23'>Mt 4:23</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 9:35'>9:35</a> ; <a ref='Mark 1:15'>Mk 1:15</a> ; <a ref='Luke 4:43'>Lk 4:43</a> ; <a ref='Luke 9:2'>9:2</a> ; <a ref='John 3:3–21'>Jn 3:3–21</a> ). <a ref='Acts 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>gathering them together.</b> An alternative reading, “eating with them,” is preferred (cf. <a ref='Acts 10:41'>10:41</a> ; <a ref='Luke 24:42–43'>Lk 24:42–43</a> ). The fact that Jesus ate provides additional proof of His bodily resurrection. <b>wait for the promise of the Father.</b> Jesus repeatedly promised that God would send them His Spirit ( <a ref='Luke 11:13'>Lk 11:13</a> ; <a ref='Luke 24:49'>24:49</a> ; <a ref='John 7:39'>Jn 7:39</a> ; <a ref='John 14:16'>14:16</a> , <a ref='John 14:26'>26</a> ; <a ref='John 15:26'>15:26</a> ; <a ref='John 16:7'>16:7</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='John 20:22'>Jn 20:22</a></i> ). <a ref='Acts 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>John baptized with water.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 2:38'>2:38</a> .</i> <b>baptized with the Holy Spirit.</b> The apostles had to wait until the Day of Pentecost, but since then all believers are baptized with the Holy Spirit at salvation ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:13'>1Co 12:13</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 8:9'>Ro 8:9</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:19–20'>1Co 6:19–20</a> ; <a ref='Titus 3:5–6'>Tit 3:5–6</a> ). <b>not many days from now.</b> God’s promise was fulfilled just 10 days later. <a ref='Acts 1:6'>1:6</a> <b>restoring the kingdom to Israel.</b> The apostles still believed the earthly form of the kingdom of Messiah would soon be reestablished (cf. <a ref='Luke 19:11'>Lk 19:11</a> ; <a ref='Luke 24:21'>24:21</a> ). They also knew that <a ref='Eze 36'>Eze 36</a> and <a ref='Joe 2'>Joel 2</a> connected the coming of the kingdom with the outpouring of the Spirit whom Jesus had promised. <a ref='Acts 1:7'>1:7</a> This verse shows that the apostles’ expectation of a literal, earthly kingdom mirrored what Christ taught and what the OT predicted. Otherwise, He would have corrected them about such a crucial aspect of His teaching. <b>times or seasons.</b> These two words refer to features, eras, and events that will be part of His earthly kingdom reign, which will begin at the second coming ( <a ref='Matthew 25:21–34'>Mt 25:21–34</a> ). The exact time of His return, however, remains unrevealed ( <a ref='Mark 13:32'>Mk 13:32</a> ; cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:29'>Dt 29:29</a> ). <a ref='Acts 1:8'>1:8</a> The apostles’ mission of spreading the gospel was the major reason the Holy Spirit empowered them. This event dramatically altered world history, and the gospel message eventually reached all parts of the earth ( <a ref='Matthew 28:19–20'>Mt 28:19–20</a> ). <b>receive power.</b> The apostles had already experienced the Holy Spirit’s saving, guiding, teaching, and miracle-working power. Soon they would receive His indwelling presence and a new dimension of power for witness ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Acts 2:4'>2:4</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:19–20'>1Co 6:19–20</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 3:16'>Eph 3:16</a> , <a ref='Ephesians 3:20'>20</a></i> ). <b>witnesses.</b> People who tell the truth about Jesus Christ (cf. <a ref='John 14:26'>Jn 14:26</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 3:15'>1Pe 3:15</a> ).

This is the last biblical mention of lots—the coming of the Spirit made them unnecessary. <a ref='Acts 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>day of Pentecost.</b> “Pentecost” means “fiftieth” and refers to the Feast of Weeks ( <a ref='Exodus 34:22–23'>Ex 34:22–23</a> ) or Harvest ( <a ref='Leviticus 23:16'>Lv 23:16</a> ), which was celebrated 50 days after Passover in May/June ( <a ref='Leviticus 23:15–22'>Lv 23:15–22</a> ). It was one of 3 annual feasts for which the nation was to come to Jerusalem ( <i>see note on <a ref='Exodus 23:14–19'>Ex 23:14–19</a></i> ). At Pentecost, an offering of first fruits was made ( <a ref='Leviticus 23:20'>Lv 23:20</a> ). The Holy Spirit came on this day as the first fruits of the believer’s inheritance (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:5'>2Co 5:5</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:11'>Eph 1:11</a> , <a ref='Ephesians 1:14'>14</a> ).

Wind is frequently used in Scripture as a picture of the Spirit (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:9–10'>Eze 37:9–10</a> ; <a ref='John 3:8'>Jn 3:8</a> ). <a ref='Acts 2:3'>2:3</a> The disciples could not comprehend the significance of the Spirit’s arrival without the Lord sovereignly illustrating what was occurring with a visible phenomenon. <b>tongues like fire.</b> Just as the sound, like wind, was symbolic, these were not literal flames of fire but supernatural indicators, like fire, that God had sent the Holy Spirit upon each believer. In Scripture, fire often denoted the divine presence (cf. <a ref='Exodus 3:2–6'>Ex 3:2–6</a> ). God’s use of a fire-like appearance here parallels what He did with the dove when Jesus was baptized ( <a ref='Matthew 3:11'>Mt 3:11</a> ; <a ref='Luke 3:16'>Lk 3:16</a> ). <a ref='Acts 2:4'>2:4</a> <b>all.</b> The apostles and the 120. Cf. <a ref='Joel 2:28–32'>Joel 2:28–32</a> . <b>filled with the Holy Spirit.</b> In contrast to the baptism with the Spirit, which is the one-time act by which God places believers into His body ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:13'>1Co 12:13</a></i> ), the filling is a repeated reality of Spirit-controlled behavior that God commands believers to maintain ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Ephesians 5:18'>Eph 5:18</a></i> ). Peter and many others in <a ref='Ac 2'>Ac 2</a> were filled with the Spirit again (e.g., <a ref='Acts 4:8'>4:8</a> , <a ref='Acts 4:31'>31</a> ; <a ref='Acts 6:5'>6:5</a> ; <a ref='Acts 7:55'>7:55</a> ) and so spoke boldly the Word of God. The fullness of the Spirit affects all areas of life, not just speaking boldly (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 5:19–33'>Eph 5:19–33</a> ). <b>with other tongues.</b> Known languages ( <i>see notes on v. <a ref='Acts 2:6'>6</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 14:1–25'>1Co 14:1–25</a></i> ), not ecstatic utterances. These languages given by the Spirit were a sign of judgment to unbelieving Israel ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Corinthians 14:21–22'>1Co 14:21–22</a></i> ). They also showed that from then on God’s people would come from all nations, and marked the transition from Israel to the church. Tongues speaking occurs only twice more in Acts ( <a ref='Acts 10:46'>10:46</a> ; <a ref='Acts 19:6'>19:6</a> ). <a ref='Acts 2:5'>2:5</a> <b>Jews … devout men.</b> Hebrew males who made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. They were expected to celebrate Pentecost ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Acts 2:1'>1</a></i> ) in Jerusalem, as part of observing the Jewish religious calendar. <i>See note on <a ref='Exodus 23:14–19'>Ex 23:14–19</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 2:6'>2:6</a> <b>this sound.</b> The noise like gusty wind (v. <a ref='Acts 2:2'>2</a> ), not the sound of the various languages. <b>speak in his own language.</b> As the believers were speaking, each pilgrim in the crowd recognized the language or dialect from his own country. <a ref='Acts 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>Galileans.</b> Inhabitants of the mostly rural area of northern Israel around the Sea of Galilee. Galilean Jews spoke with a distinct regional accent and were considered to be unsophisticated and uneducated by the southern Judean Jews. When Galileans were seen to be speaking so many different languages, the Judean Jews were astonished. <a ref='Acts 2:9–11'>2:9–11</a> The listing of specific countries and ethnic groups proves again that these utterances were known human languages. <a ref='Acts 2:9'>2:9</a> <b>Parthians.</b> They lived in what is modern Iran. <b>Medes.</b> In Daniel’s time, they ruled with the Persians, but had settled in Parthia. <b>Elamites.</b> They were from the southwestern part of the Parthian Empire. <b>Mesopotamia.</b> This means “between the rivers” (the Tigris and Euphrates).

Joel’s prophecy will not be completely fulfilled until the millennial kingdom. But Peter, by using it, shows that Pentecost was a pre-fulfillment, a taste of what will happen in the millennial kingdom when the Spirit is poured out on all flesh (cf. <a ref='Acts 10:45'>10:45</a> ). <a ref='Acts 2:17'>2:17</a> last days <b>.</b> This phrase refers to the present era of redemptive history from the first coming of Christ ( <a ref='Hebrews 1:2'>Heb 1:2</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:20'>1Pe 1:20</a> ; <a ref='1 John 2:18'>1Jn 2:18</a> ) to His return.

While they were not limited to believers (e.g., Abimelech, <a ref='Genesis 20:3'>Ge 20:3</a> and Pharaoh, <a ref='Genesis 41:1–8'>Ge 41:1–8</a> ), they were primarily reserved for prophets and apostles (cf. <a ref='Numbers 12:6'>Nu 12:6</a> ). While frequent in the OT, they were rare in the NT. In Acts, most of God’s visions were associated with either Peter (chaps. <a ref='Ac 10-11'>10–11</a> ) or Paul (chaps. <a ref='Ac 9'>9</a> , <a ref='Ac 18'>18</a> ; cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 12:1'>2Co 12:1</a> ). Most frequently they were used to reveal apocalyptic imagery (cf. Eze, Da, Zec, Rev). They were not considered normal in biblical times, nor should they be so now.

Peter had been an eyewitness to that ascension ( <a ref='Acts 1:9–11'>1:9–11</a> ). <a ref='Acts 2:36'>2:36</a> Peter summarizes his sermon with a powerful statement of certainty: the OT prophecies of resurrection and exaltation provide evidence that overwhelmingly points to the crucified Jesus as the Messiah. <b>both Lord and Christ.</b> Jesus is God as well as anointed Messiah (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:4'>Ro 1:4</a> ; <a ref='Romans 10:9'>10:9</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:3'>1Co 12:3</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 2:9'>Php 2:9</a> , <a ref='Philippians 2:11'>11</a> ). <a ref='Acts 2:37'>2:37</a> <b>pierced to the heart.</b> The Greek word for “pierced” means “stab,” and thus denotes something sudden and unexpected.

Such change involves more than fearing the consequences of God’s judgment. Genuine repentance knows that the evil of sin must be forsaken and the person and work of Christ totally and singularly embraced. Peter exhorted his hearers to repent, otherwise they would not experience true conversion ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 3:2'>Mt 3:2</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Acts 3:19'>3:19</a> ; <a ref='Acts 5:31'>5:31</a> ; <a ref='Acts 8:22'>8:22</a> ; <a ref='Acts 11:18'>11:18</a> ; <a ref='Acts 17:30'>17:30</a> ; <a ref='Acts 20:21'>20:21</a> ; <a ref='Acts 26:20'>26:20</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 4:17'>Mt 4:17</a> ). <b>be baptized.</b> This Greek word lit. means “be dipped or immersed” in water. Peter was obeying Christ’s command from <a ref='Matthew 28:19'>Mt 28:19</a> and urging the people who repented and turned to the Lord Christ for salvation to identify, through the waters of baptism, with His death, burial, and resurrection (cf. <a ref='Acts 19:5'>19:5</a> ; <a ref='Romans 6:3–4'>Ro 6:3–4</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:13'>1Co 12:13</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:27'>Ga 3:27</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 3:2'>Mt 3:2</a></i> ). This is the first time the apostles publicly enjoined people to obey that ceremony. Prior to this, many Jews had experienced the baptism of John the Baptist ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 3:1–3'>Mt 3:1–3</a></i> ), and were also familiar with the baptism of Gentile converts to Judaism (proselytes). <b>in the name of Jesus Christ.</b> For the new believer, it was a crucial but costly identification to accept. <b>for the forgiveness of your sins.</b> This might better be translated “because of the forgiveness of sins.” Baptism does not produce forgiveness and cleansing from sin. <i>See notes on <a ref='1 Peter 3:20–21'>1Pe 3:20–21</a> .</i> The reality of forgiveness precedes the rite of baptism (v. <a ref='Acts 2:41'>41</a> ). Genuine repentance brings from God the forgiveness of sins (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 1:7'>Eph 1:7</a> ), and because of that the new believer was to be baptized. Baptism, however, was to be the ever-present act of obedience, so that it became synonymous with salvation. Thus to say one was baptized for forgiveness was the same as saying one was saved. <i>See note on “one baptism” in <a ref='Ephesians 4:5'>Eph 4:5</a> .</i> Every believer enjoys the complete forgiveness of sins ( <a ref='Matthew 26:28'>Mt 26:28</a> ; <a ref='Luke 24:47'>Lk 24:47</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:7'>Eph 1:7</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:13'>Col 2:13</a> ; <a ref='1 John 2:12'>1Jn 2:12</a> ). <b>the gift of the Holy Spirit.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Acts 1:5'>1:5</a> , <a ref='Acts 1:8'>8</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 2:39'>2:39</a> <b>the promise.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 1:4'>1:4</a> .</i> <b>all who are far off.</b> Gentiles, who would also share in the blessings of salvation (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 2:11–13'>Eph 2:11–13</a> ). <b>as many as the Lord our God will call.</b> Salvation is ultimately from the Lord. <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 3:24'>Ro 3:24</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 2:41'>2:41</a> <b>those who had received his word were baptized.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Acts 2:38'>38</a> .</i> <b>three thousand.</b> Luke’s use of a specific number suggests records were kept of conversions and baptisms ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Acts 2:38'>38</a></i> ).

It seems, therefore, that a permanent order of deacons was not established at that time. <b>full of the Spirit.</b> Cf. v. <a ref='Acts 6:5'>5</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Acts 2:4'>2:4</a></i> . <a ref='Acts 6:4'>6:4</a> Prayer and the ministry of the Word (cf. v. <a ref='Acts 6:2'>2</a> ) define the highest priorities of church leaders. <a ref='Acts 6:5'>6:5</a> The 7 men chosen by the church all had Greek names, implying they were all Hellenists. The church, in a display of love and unity, may have chosen them to rectify the apparent imbalance involving the Hellenistic widows. <b>they chose Stephen … Nicolas.</b> For Stephen’s ministry, see <a ref='Acts 6:9–7:60'>6:9—7:60</a> . His martyrdom became the catalyst for the spread of the gospel beyond Palestine ( <a ref='Acts 8:1–4'>8:1–4</a> ; <a ref='Acts 11:19'>11:19</a> ). Philip also played a key role in the spread of the gospel (cf. <a ref='Acts 8:4–24'>8:4–24</a> , <a ref='Acts 8:26–40'>26–40</a> ). Nothing certain is known of the other 5. According to some early traditions, Prochorus became the apostle John’s amanuensis (scribe) when he wrote his Gospel and Nicolas was a Gentile convert to Judaism from Antioch. <a ref='Acts 6:6'>6:6</a> <b>after praying, they laid their hands on them.</b> This expression was used of Jesus when He healed ( <a ref='Mark 6:5'>Mk 6:5</a> ; <a ref='Luke 4:40'>Lk 4:40</a> ; <a ref='Luke 13:13'>13:13</a> ; cf. <a ref='Acts 28:8'>28:8</a> ) and sometimes indicated being taken prisoner ( <a ref='Acts 5:18'>5:18</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:46'>Mk 14:46</a> ). In the OT, offerers of sacrifices laid their hands on the animal as an expression of identification ( <a ref='Leviticus 8:14'>Lv 8:14</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 8:18'>18</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 8:22'>22</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 6:2'>Heb 6:2</a> ). But in the symbolic sense, it signified the affirmation, support, and identification with someone and his ministry. See <a ref='1 Timothy 4:14'>1Ti 4:14</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 5:22'>5:22</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 1:6'>2Ti 1:6</a> ; cf. <a ref='Numbers 27:23'>Nu 27:23</a> . <a ref='Acts 6:7'>6:7</a> One of Luke’s periodic statements summarizing the growth of the church and the spread of the gospel (cf. <a ref='Acts 2:41'>2:41</a> , <a ref='Acts 2:47'>47</a> ; <a ref='Acts 4:4'>4:4</a> ; <a ref='Acts 5:14'>5:14</a> ; <a ref='Acts 9:31'>9:31</a> ; <a ref='Acts 12:24'>12:24</a> ; <a ref='Acts 13:49'>13:49</a> ; <a ref='Acts 16:5'>16:5</a> ; <a ref='Acts 19:20'>19:20</a> ). <b>great many of the priests.</b> The conversion of large numbers of priests may account for the vicious opposition that arose against Stephen. <b>were … obedient to the faith.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Romans 1:5'>Ro 1:5</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 6:8'>6:8</a> <b>wonders and signs.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 2:19'>2:19</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 6:9'>6:9</a> It seems that this verse describes 3 synagogues: the Synagogue of the Freedmen, a second composed of Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and a third composed of those from Cilicia and Asia. Cultural and linguistic differences among the 3 groups make it unlikely they all attended the same synagogue. <b>Synagogue.</b> These were meeting places which began in the intertestamental period where the dispersed Jews (usually Hellenists), who did not have temple access, could meet in their community to worship and read the OT. <i>See note on <a ref='Mark 1:21'>Mk 1:21</a> .</i> <b>Freedmen.</b> Descendants of Jewish slaves captured by Pompeii (63 BC) and taken to Rome. They were later freed and formed a Jewish community there. <b>Cyrenians.</b> Men from Cyrene, a city in North Africa.

The powerful preacher Apollos was from Alexandria ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 18:24'>18:24</a></i> ). <b>Cilicia and Asia.</b> Roman provinces in Asia Minor (modern Turkey). Since Paul’s hometown (Tarsus) was located in Cilicia, he probably attended this synagogue. <b>were arguing with Stephen.</b> The word translated “arguing” signifies a formal debate. They no doubt focused on such themes as the death and resurrection of Jesus, and the OT evidence that He was the Messiah. <a ref='Acts 6:11'>6:11</a> <b>blasphemous words against Moses and God.</b> Unable to prevail over Stephen in open debate, his enemies resorted to deceit and conspiracy. As with Jesus ( <a ref='Matthew 26:59–61'>Mt 26:59–61</a> ), they secretly recruited false witnesses to spread lies about Stephen. The charges were serious, since blasphemy was punishable by death ( <a ref='Leviticus 24:16'>Lv 24:16</a> ). <a ref='Acts 6:14'>6:14</a> <b>Jesus … will destroy this place.</b> Another lie, since Jesus’ words ( <a ref='John 2:19'>Jn 2:19</a> ) referred to His own body ( <a ref='John 2:21'>Jn 2:21</a> ). <a ref='Acts 6:15'>6:15</a> <b>face of an angel.</b> Pure, calm, unruffled composure, reflecting the presence of God (cf. <a ref='Exodus 34:29–35'>Ex 34:29–35</a> ). <a ref='Acts 7:1'>7:1</a> <b>high priest.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Acts 4:6'>4:6</a> .</i> Probably Caiaphas ( <i>see note on <a ref='John 18:13–14'>Jn 18:13–14</a></i> ), who remained in office until AD 36. <b>Are these things so?</b> In modern legal terminology, “How do you plead?” <a ref='Acts 7:2–53'>7:2–53</a> Stephen’s response does not seem to answer the High Priest’s question.

Evidently, God had originally called Abraham while he was living in Ur (cf. <a ref='Genesis 15:7'>Ge 15:7</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 9:7'>Ne 9:7</a> ), then repeated that call at Haran ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Genesis 11:31'>Ge 11:31</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>12:1–3</a></i> ). <a ref='Acts 7:3'>7:3</a> Quoted from <a ref='Genesis 12:1'>Ge 12:1</a> . <a ref='Acts 7:4'>7:4</a> <b>land of the Chaldeans.</b> Where Abraham’s original home city of Ur was located ( <a ref='Genesis 11:28'>Ge 11:28</a> , <a ref='Genesis 11:31'>31</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 15:7'>15:7</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 9:7'>Ne 9:7</a> ). <b>after his father died.</b> At first glance, <a ref='Genesis 11:26'>Ge 11:26</a> , <a ref='Genesis 11:32'>32</a> and <a ref='Genesis 12:4'>12:4</a> seem to indicate that Terah lived for 60 years after Abraham’s departure from Haran. Terah was 70 when his first son was born ( <a ref='Genesis 11:26'>Ge 11:26</a> ); Abraham was 75 when he left Haran ( <a ref='Genesis 12:4'>Ge 12:4</a> ; Terah would have been 145); and Terah lived to be 205 ( <a ref='Genesis 11:32'>Ge 11:32</a> ). The best solution to this apparent difficulty is that Abraham was not Terah’s firstborn son, but was mentioned first ( <a ref='Genesis 11:26'>Ge 11:26</a> ) because he was most prominent.

However the LXX (the Greek translation of the OT, which as a Hellenist Stephen would have used) in <a ref='Genesis 46:27'>Ge 46:27</a> reads “seventy-five.” The additional 5 people were Joseph’s descendants born in Egypt. <i>See notes on <a ref='Genesis 46:26–27'>Ge 46:26–27</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 7:16'>7:16</a> <b>they were … placed in the tomb.</b> “They” refers to Joseph ( <a ref='Joshua 24:32'>Jos 24:32</a> ) and his brothers, but not Jacob, who was buried in Abraham’s tomb at Machpelah ( <a ref='Genesis 50:13'>Ge 50:13</a> ). <b>the tomb which Abraham had purchased … of Hamor in Shechem.</b> <a ref='Joshua 24:32'>Joshua 24:32</a> states that Jacob bought this tomb, although Abraham had earlier built an altar at Shechem ( <a ref='Genesis 12:6–7'>Ge 12:6–7</a> ), and probably purchased the land on which he built it. Abraham did not settle there, however, and the land apparently reverted to the people of Hamor. Jacob then repurchased it from Shechem ( <a ref='Genesis 33:18–20'>Ge 33:18–20</a> ), much like Isaac repurchased the well at Beersheba ( <a ref='Genesis 26:28–31'>Ge 26:28–31</a> ) that Abraham had originally bought ( <a ref='Genesis 21:27–30'>Ge 21:27–30</a> ).

After resettling many of the people in other lands, the Assyrians located Gentiles from other areas into the region, resulting in a mix of Jews and Gentiles who became known as Samaritans ( <i>see notes on <a ref='John 4:4'>Jn 4:4</a> , <a ref='John 4:20'>20</a></i> ). <a ref='Acts 8:7'>8:7</a> <b>unclean spirits.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 5:16'>5:16</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 8:9'>8:9</a> <b>magic.</b> This word originally referred to the practices of the Medo-Persians: a mixture of science and superstition, including astrology, divination, and the occult ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:9–12'>Dt 18:9–12</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 9:21'>Rev 9:21</a></i> ). <a ref='Acts 8:10–11'>8:10–11</a> <b>the Great Power of God.</b> Simon claimed to be united to God.

This was a transitional period in which confirmation by the apostles was necessary to verify the inclusion of a new group of people into the church. Because of the animosity that existed between Jews and Samaritans, it was essential for the Samaritans to receive the Spirit, in the presence of the leaders of the Jerusalem church, for the purpose of maintaining a unified church. The delay also revealed the Samaritans’ need to come under apostolic authority. The same transitional event occurred when the Gentiles were added to the church ( <a ref='Acts 10:44–46'>10:44–46</a> ; cf. <a ref='Acts 15:6–12'>15:6–12</a> ; <a ref='Acts 19:6'>19:6</a> ). <a ref='Acts 8:17'>8:17</a> <b>laying their hands on them.</b> This signified apostolic affirmation and solidarity. <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 6:6'>6:6</a> .</i> <b>receiving the Holy Spirit.</b> That this actually occurred likely demonstrated that believers also spoke in tongues here, just as those who received the Spirit did on the Day of Pentecost ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 2:4'>2:4</a></i> ), as the Gentiles did when they received the Spirit ( <a ref='Acts 10:46'>10:46</a> ), and as those followers of John did ( <a ref='Acts 19:6'>19:6</a> ). As Samaritans, Gentiles, and believers from the Old Covenant were added to the church, the unity of the church was established. No longer could one nation (Israel) be God’s witness people, but the church was made up of Jews, Gentiles, half-breed Samaritans, and OT saints who became NT believers ( <a ref='Acts 19:1–7'>19:1–7</a> ). To demonstrate the unity, it was imperative that there be some replication in each instance of what had occurred at Pentecost with the believing Jews, such as the presence of the apostles and the coming of the Spirit manifestly indicated through speaking in the languages of Pentecost ( <a ref='Acts 2:5–12'>2:5–12</a> ). <a ref='Acts 8:22–24'>8:22–24</a> Although Simon was certainly fearful, he was unwilling to repent and seek forgiveness, wanting only to escape the consequences of his sin. <a ref='Acts 8:26'>8:26</a> <b>Gaza.</b> One of 5 chief cities of the Philistines.

It is likely he was both since Luke refers to him as a eunuch and as one who held a position of authority in the queen’s court—that of treasurer, much like a minister of finance or secretary of the treasury. As a physical eunuch, he would have been denied access to the temple ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:1'>Dt 23:1</a> ) and the opportunity to become a full proselyte to Judaism. <b>Candace.</b> Probably not a name, but an official title (like Pharaoh or Caesar) given to the queen mothers in that land. <a ref='Acts 8:28'>8:28</a> <b>reading … Isaiah.</b> He knew the importance of seeking God through the Scripture ( <a ref='Luke 24:25–27'>Lk 24:25–27</a> ; <a ref='John 5:39'>Jn 5:39</a> , <a ref='John 5:46'>46</a> ; <a ref='Romans 10:12–15'>Ro 10:12–15</a> ). <a ref='Acts 8:32–33'>8:32–33</a> <b>passage … he was reading.</b> <a ref='Isaiah 53:7–8'>Isaiah 53:7–8</a> . <a ref='Acts 8:34'>8:34</a> <b>of whom does the prophet say this?</b> His confusion was understandable.

Luke mentions no synagogue in connection with Lystra, and since Paul began his ministry there by preaching to a crowd, it likely had a small Jewish population. Derbe was about 40 mi. southeast of Lystra. <a ref='Acts 14:11–13'>14:11–13</a> The strange reaction by the people of Lystra to the healing had its roots in local folklore. According to tradition, the gods Zeus and Hermes visited Lystra incognito, asking for food and lodging. All turned them away except for a peasant named Philemon and his wife, Baucis. The gods took vengeance by drowning everyone in a flood. But they turned the lowly cottage of Philemon and Baucis into a temple, where they were to serve as priest and priestess. Not wanting to repeat their ancestors’ mistake, the people of Lystra believed Barnabas to be Zeus and Paul to be Hermes. <a ref='Acts 14:11'>14:11</a> <b>Lycaonian language.</b> Paul and Barnabas were unable to understand the intentions of the people. <a ref='Acts 14:13'>14:13</a> <b>priest of Zeus.</b> It was his job to lead the people in worship of the two men they believed to be gods. <a ref='Acts 14:14'>14:14</a> <b>tore their garments.</b> A Jewish expression of horror and revulsion at blasphemy ( <i>see note on <a ref='Matthew 26:65'>Mt 26:65</a></i> ). <a ref='Acts 14:15–17'>14:15–17</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 17:23–24'>17:23–24</a> .</i> Because the crowd at Lystra was pagan and had no knowledge of the OT, Paul adjusted his message to fit the audience. Instead of proclaiming the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, he appealed to the universal and rational knowledge of the One who created the world (cf. <a ref='Acts 17:22–26'>17:22–26</a> ; <a ref='Jonah 1:9'>Jon 1:9</a> ). <a ref='Acts 14:15'>14:15</a> <b>vain things.</b> An appropriate description of idolatry and all false religions. <a ref='Acts 14:16'>14:16</a> <b>permitted all the nations.</b> The path that they all have walked is described in <a ref='Romans 1:18–32'>Ro 1:18–32</a> . <a ref='Acts 14:17'>14:17</a> <b>did not leave Himself without witness.</b> God’s providence and His creative power testify to man’s reason of His existence ( <a ref='Romans 1:18–20'>Ro 1:18–20</a> ), as does man’s own conscience, which contains His moral law ( <a ref='Romans 2:13–15'>Ro 2:13–15</a> ). <a ref='Acts 14:19'>14:19</a> <b>stoning Paul … supposing him to be dead.</b> Paul did not die from the stoning as some claim, who link it to his third-heaven experience in <a ref='2Co 12'>2Co 12</a> . “Supposing” usually means “to suppose something that is not true.” The main NT use of this word argues that the crowd’s supposition was incorrect and that Paul was not dead. Another argument in favor of this position is that if Paul was resurrected, why didn’t Luke mention it? Also, the dates of Paul’s third-heaven experience and the time of the stoning do not reconcile. <a ref='Acts 14:20'>14:20</a> <b>Derbe.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Acts 14:6'>6</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 14:22'>14:22</a> <b>kingdom of God.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 1:3'>1:3</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 14:23'>14:23</a> <b>appointed elders.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 11:30'>11:30</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 14:24'>14:24</a> <b>Pisidia.</b> A mountainous and rugged region that offered no opportunities for evangelism. <b>Pamphylia.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 13:13'>13:13</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 14:25'>14:25</a> <b>Perga.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 13:13'>13:13</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 14:26'>14:26</a> <b>from there.</b> Thus ended Paul’s first missionary journey. <b>Antioch.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 11:19'>11:19</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 14:28'>14:28</a> <b>not a little time.</b> About one year. <a ref='Acts 15:1–30'>15:1–30</a> Throughout its history, the church’s leaders have met to settle doctrinal issues.

Yet the most important council was the first one—the Jerusalem Council—because it established the answer to the most vital doctrinal question of all: “What must a person do to be saved?” The apostles and elders defied efforts to impose legalism and ritualism as necessary prerequisites for salvation. They forever affirmed that salvation is totally by grace through faith in Christ alone. <a ref='Acts 15:1'>15:1</a> <b>Some men.</b> Judaizers—false teachers who were self-appointed guardians of legalism, teaching a doctrine of salvation by works. <b>from Judea.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 1:8'>1:8</a> .</i> <b>Unless you are circumcised … you cannot be saved.</b> Cf. v. <a ref='Acts 15:24'>24</a> .

In fact, in the kingdom God’s messengers will announce salvation to the Gentiles ( <a ref='Zechariah 8:20–23'>Zec 8:20–23</a> ). <a ref='Acts 15:17'>15:17</a> Gentiles … called by My name <b>.</b> James’ point is that Amos makes no mention of Gentiles becoming Jewish proselytes.

The Judaizers were to cease troubling and annoying the Gentiles. <a ref='Acts 15:20'>15:20</a> James and the other leaders did not want the Gentiles to revel in their freedom in Christ, which could cause the Jewish believers to follow that same liberty and violate their consciences. So James proposed that the Gentiles abstain from 4 pagan, idolatrous practices that were violations of the law of Moses so as not to offend Jews. <b>things contaminated by idols.</b> Food offered to pagan gods and then sold in temple butcher shops.

Stoic philosophy taught self-mastery—that the goal in life was to reach a place of indifference to pleasure or pain. <b>babbler.</b> Lit. “seed picker.” Some of the philosophers viewed Paul as an amateur philosopher—one who had no ideas of his own but only picked among prevailing philosophies and constructed one with no depth. <a ref='Acts 17:19'>17:19</a> <b>the Areopagus.</b> A court named for the hill on which it once met.

His ministry profoundly influenced the Corinthians (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:12'>1Co 1:12</a> ). <b>Alexandrian by birth.</b> Alexandria was an important city in Egypt located near the mouth of the Nile. In the first century, it had a large Jewish population. Thus Apollos, though born outside of Israel, was reared in a Jewish cultural setting. <b>mighty in the Scriptures.</b> Used only here, this phrase refers to Apollos’ knowledge of the OT Scriptures. That knowledge, combined with his eloquence, allowed him to crush his Jewish opponents in debate (v. <a ref='Acts 18:28'>28</a> ). <a ref='Acts 18:25'>18:25</a> <b>the way of the Lord.</b> This did not include the Christian faith (cf. v. <a ref='Acts 18:26'>26</a> ). The OT uses the phrase to describe the spiritual and moral standards God required His people to observe ( <a ref='Genesis 18:19'>Ge 18:19</a> ; <a ref='Judges 2:22'>Jdg 2:22</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 12:23'>1Sa 12:23</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 22:22'>2Sa 22:22</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 21:22'>2Ki 21:22</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 17:6'>2Chr 17:6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 18:21'>Pss 18:21</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 25:8–9'>25:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 138:5'>138:5</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 10:29'>Pr 10:29</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 5:4–5'>Jer 5:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 18:25'>Eze 18:25</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 18:29'>29</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 33:17'>33:17</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 33:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 14:9'>Hos 14:9</a> ). <b>baptism of John.</b> Despite his knowledge of the OT, Apollos did not fully understand Christian truth. John’s baptism was to prepare Israel for the Messiah’s arrival (cf. <a ref='Luke 1:16–17'>Lk 1:16–17</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Acts 2:38'>2:38</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 3:6'>Mt 3:6</a></i> ). Apollos accepted that message, even acknowledging that Jesus of Nazareth was Israel’s Messiah. He did not, however, understand such basic Christian truths as the significance of Christ’s death and resurrection, the ministry of the Holy Spirit, and the church as God’s new witness people. He was a redeemed OT believer (v. <a ref='Acts 18:24'>24</a> ). <a ref='Acts 18:26'>18:26</a> <b>the way of God more accurately.</b> Aquila and Priscilla completed Apollos’ training in divine truth by instructing him in the fullness of the Christian faith. <a ref='Acts 18:27'>18:27</a> <b>Achaia.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Acts 18:12'>12</a> .</i> Apollos planned to cross from Asia Minor (modern Turkey) to Corinth on the Greek mainland ( <a ref='Acts 19:1'>19:1</a> ). <b>the brothers … wrote.</b> Such letters of commendation were common in the early church (cf. <a ref='Romans 16:1–2'>Ro 16:1–2</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 16:10'>1Co 16:10</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 3:1–2'>2Co 3:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 4:10'>Col 4:10</a> ). The Ephesian Christians wrote to inform their Corinthian brethren that Apollos was now a fully informed Christian. <a ref='Acts 18:28'>18:28</a> <b>the Christ.</b> The Messiah of Israel. <a ref='Acts 19:1'>19:1</a> <b>the upper regions.</b> The area of Asia Minor north of Ephesus, where Luke left Paul before the interlude describing Apollos’ ministry ( <a ref='Acts 18:23'>18:23</a> ). By going through that area, Paul took the direct route to Ephesus, not the more common trade route. <b>Ephesus.</b> See Introduction to Ephesians . <b>some disciples.</b> They were of John the Baptist (v. <a ref='Acts 19:3'>3</a> ); hence OT seekers. That they did not yet fully understand the Christian faith is evident from their reply to Paul’s question (v. <a ref='Acts 19:2'>2</a> ). The word “disciple” means “learner,” or “follower,” and does not always refer to Christians (cf. <a ref='Matthew 9:14'>Mt 9:14</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 11:2'>11:2</a> ; <a ref='Mark 2:18'>Mk 2:18</a> ; <a ref='Luke 5:33'>Lk 5:33</a> ; <a ref='Luke 7:18–19'>7:18–19</a> ; <a ref='Luke 11:1'>11:1</a> ; <a ref='John 1:35'>Jn 1:35</a> ; <a ref='John 6:66'>6:66</a> ). Followers of John the Baptist, like this group, existed into the second century. <a ref='Acts 19:2'>19:2</a> <b>Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?</b> The question reflects Paul’s uncertainty about their spiritual status. Since all Christians receive the Holy Spirit at the moment of salvation ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 8:9'>Ro 8:9</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:13'>1Co 12:13</a></i> ), their answer revealed they were not yet fully Christians. They had not yet received Christian baptism (having been baptized only “into John’s baptism”) which further evidenced that they were not Christians ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 2:38'>2:38</a></i> ). <a ref='Acts 19:4'>19:4</a> <b>baptism of repentance … believe in … Jesus.</b> These disciples did not realize Jesus of Nazareth was the One to whom John’s baptism pointed. Paul gave them instruction not on how to receive the Spirit, but about Jesus Christ. <a ref='Acts 19:5'>19:5</a> <b>baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</b> They believed Paul’s presentation of the gospel and came to saving faith in the Lord Jesus Christ (cf. <a ref='Acts 2:41'>2:41</a> ). Although required of all Christians, baptism does not save ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 2:38'>2:38</a></i> ). <a ref='Acts 19:6'>19:6</a> <b>Paul … laid his hands upon them.</b> This signified their inclusion into the church ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 8:17'>8:17</a></i> ). Apostles were also present when the church was born (chap. <a ref='Ac 2'>2</a> ), and when the Samaritans (chap. <a ref='Ac 8'>8</a> ) and Gentiles (chap. <a ref='Ac 10'>10</a> ) were included. In each case, God’s purpose was to emphasize the unity of the church. <b>speaking with tongues and prophesying.</b> This served as proof that they were part of the church ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 8:17'>8:17</a></i> ). They also needed tangible evidence that the Holy Spirit now indwelt them, since they had not heard that He had come (v. <a ref='Acts 19:2'>2</a> ). <a ref='Acts 19:8'>19:8</a> <b>synagogue.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 13:5'>13:5</a> .</i> <b>three months.</b> Paul’s longest stay in any synagogue, with the possible exception of the one at Corinth. <b>kingdom of God.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 1:3'>1:3</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 19:9'>19:9</a> <b>hardened.</b> The Greek word always refers to defiance against God ( <a ref='Romans 9:18'>Ro 9:18</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 3:8'>Heb 3:8</a> , <a ref='Hebrews 3:13'>13</a> , <a ref='Hebrews 3:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 4:7'>4:7</a> ). Truth rejected leads to a hardened heart, causing the life-giving message of salvation to become “an aroma from death to death” ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 2:16'>2Co 2:16</a> ). <b>the Way.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 9:2'>9:2</a> .</i> <b>the school of Tyrannus.</b> Tyrannus was either the owner of the lecture hall, or a philosopher who taught there. If the latter, his name, which means “our tyrant,” may have been a nickname given him by his students. Paul used the hall during the afternoon break (from about 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.), when it would otherwise be unoccupied. <a ref='Acts 19:10'>19:10</a> <b>two years.</b> The length of time Paul taught in the school of Tyrannus, not the total length of his ministry at Ephesus (cf. <a ref='Acts 20:31'>20:31</a> ). <b>all … in Asia heard.</b> Though Paul probably never left Ephesus, his converts (cf. <a ref='2 Timothy 2:2'>2Ti 2:2</a> ) spread the gospel throughout the province of Asia Minor (modern Turkey). This two-year period saw the founding of the churches at Colosse and Hierapolis, and possibly some of the 7 churches mentioned in <a ref='Rev 2-3'>Rev 2–3</a> , beyond the one at Ephesus. <a ref='Acts 19:11'>19:11</a> <b>extraordinary miracles.</b> These confirmed that Paul was God’s messenger, since there was no completed NT to use to determine the truth of his message (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 12:12'>2Co 12:12</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 2:3–4'>Heb 2:3–4</a> ). <a ref='Acts 19:12'>19:12</a> <b>cloths … aprons.</b> The headbands and outer clothing Paul wore while making tents. The belief that mystical power could be so transmitted was widespread in the ancient world, e.g., believing that Peter’s shadow could heal (cf. <a ref='Acts 5:15'>5:15</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 9:21'>Mt 9:21</a> ). <a ref='Acts 19:13'>19:13</a> <b>Jewish exorcists.</b> Simon Magus ( <a ref='Acts 8:9–25'>8:9–25</a> ) and Bar-Jesus ( <a ref='Acts 13:6–12'>13:6–12</a> ) were other possible examples of such charlatans (cf. <a ref='Matthew 12:27'>Mt 12:27</a> ). In contrast to the absolute authority exercised by Jesus and the apostles over demons, those exorcists sought to expel the demons by attempting to call on a more potent spirit being—in this case the Lord Jesus. <a ref='Acts 19:14'>19:14</a> <b>Sceva, a Jewish chief priest.</b> Since there is no record of a Jewish High Priest by that name, he probably assumed that title falsely to impress people. <a ref='Acts 19:15'>19:15</a> <b>recognize Jesus, and I know about Paul.</b> Recognizing that the exorcists had no authority over him (unlike Jesus and Paul), the demon rejected their attempt to expel him from his victim. This confirms that the power to cast out demons belonged to Jesus and the apostles and no one else. Even the demons give testimony to that. <a ref='Acts 19:16'>19:16</a> Cf. <a ref='Mark 5:1–4'>Mk 5:1–4</a> . <a ref='Acts 19:19'>19:19</a> <b>books.</b> Of secret magical spells. Burning them proved the genuineness of the magicians’ repentance ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 2:38'>2:38</a></i> ); having destroyed these books, they could not easily resume their practices. <b>fifty thousand pieces of silver.</b> Fifty thousand days’ wages for a common laborer—an astonishing sum of money given to indicate how widespread the practice of magic was in Ephesus. <a ref='Acts 19:21'>19:21</a> <b>purposed in the Spirit.</b> Probably his own spirit, not the Holy Spirit (see the NAS footnote). <b>Macedonia and Achaia.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Acts 16:9'>16:9</a> ; <a ref='Acts 18:12'>18:12</a> .</i> Located on the Greek mainland, these provinces were in the opposite direction from Jerusalem. Paul, however, took this roundabout route to collect an offering for the needy in the Jerusalem church ( <a ref='Romans 15:25–27'>Ro 15:25–27</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 16:1–4'>1Co 16:1–4</a> ; <a ref='2Co 8-9'>2Co 8–9</a> ). <b>I must also see Rome.</b> Paul had not visited the Imperial capital, but because of the strategic importance of the church there, he could stay away no longer. In addition, Paul intended to use Rome as a jumping-off point for ministry in the strategic region of Spain ( <a ref='Romans 15:22–24'>Ro 15:22–24</a> ). This simple declaration marked a turning point in Acts; from this point on, Rome became Paul’s goal. He would ultimately arrive there as a Roman prisoner ( <a ref='Acts 28:16'>28:16</a> ). <a ref='Acts 19:22'>19:22</a> <b>Timothy and Erastus.</b> For Timothy, <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 16:1'>16:1</a></i> . Nothing more is known of Erastus. Though the name appears two other times in Scripture ( <a ref='Romans 16:23'>Ro 16:23</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 4:20'>2Ti 4:20</a> ), he cannot with certainty be identified with either one. Paul sent these two ahead of him to assist in his collection of the offering. <a ref='Acts 19:23'>19:23</a> <b>the Way.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 9:2'>9:2</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 19:24'>19:24</a> <b>Demetrius, a silversmith.</b> Probably not the individual commended by John ( <a ref='3 John 1:12'>3Jn 12</a> ), since the name was a common one. <b>silver shrines.</b> These were of the goddess Diana (Artemis). These shrines were used as household idols, and in the worship at the temple of Diana. <b>Artemis.</b> She was also known as “Diana.” Worship of her, centered at the great temple of Diana at Ephesus (one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World), was widespread throughout the Roman Empire. It is likely that the riot described in this passage took place during the annual spring festival held in her honor at Ephesus. <b>bringing no little business.</b> This statement suggests Demetrius may have been the head of the silversmiths’ guild—which would explain his taking the lead in opposing the Christian preachers. <a ref='Acts 19:27'>19:27</a> Demetrius cleverly played upon his hearers’ fears of financial ruin, religious zeal, and concern for their city’s prestige. The Christian preachers, he argued, threatened the continued prosperity of Ephesus. His audience’s violent reaction shows they took the threat seriously (v. <a ref='Acts 19:28'>28</a> ). <a ref='Acts 19:29'>19:29</a> <b>Gaius and Aristarchus.</b> These men are described as Macedonians, though <a ref='Acts 20:4'>20:4</a> lists Gaius’ hometown as Derbe, a city in Galatia. Possibly the Gaius of <a ref='Acts 20:4'>20:4</a> was a different person. <a ref='Acts 19:31'>19:31</a> <b>Asiarchs.</b> These members of the aristocracy were dedicated to promoting Roman interests. Though only one Asiarch ruled at a time, they bore the title for life. That such powerful, influential men were Paul’s friends shows that they did not regard him or his message as criminal. Hence, there was no legitimate cause for the riot. <a ref='Acts 19:32'>19:32</a> <b>meeting.</b> The frenzied mob gathered in the theater. Though Paul courageously sought to address them, the Asiarchs (along with the Ephesian Christians, v. <a ref='Acts 19:30'>30</a> ) begged him to stay away (v. <a ref='Acts 19:31'>31</a> ). They feared both for the apostle’s safety, and that his presence would exacerbate the already explosive situation. <a ref='Acts 19:33'>19:33</a> <b>Alexander.</b> Probably not the false teacher later active at Ephesus ( <a ref='1 Timothy 1:20'>1Ti 1:20</a> ), or the individual who opposed Paul at Rome ( <a ref='2 Timothy 4:14'>2Ti 4:14</a> ), since the name was common. He was either a Christian Jew or a spokesman for Ephesus’ Jewish community. Either way, the Jews’ motive for putting him forward was the same—to disassociate themselves from the Christians and avoid a massacre of the Jews. <b>make a defense.</b> Either of the Christians, or the Jews, depending on which group he represented. <a ref='Acts 19:34'>19:34</a> <b>a Jew.</b> Whatever the Jews intended by putting Alexander forward backfired; the crowd shouted him down, and in a mindless display of religious frenzy, they chanted the name of their goddess for two hours. <a ref='Acts 19:35'>19:35</a> <b>city clerk.</b> In modern terms, he was Ephesus’ mayor. He was the liaison between the town council and the Roman authorities—who would hold him personally responsible for the riot. image <b>which fell down from heaven.</b> This probably refers to a meteorite, since meteorites were incorporated with the worship of Diana. <a ref='Acts 19:38–40'>19:38–40</a> The town clerk (v. <a ref='Acts 19:35'>35</a> ) correctly blamed the crowd for the riot, noting that they should have followed proper judicial procedure and gone to the courts and proconsuls if they had any complaints, so as not to incur serious consequences from Rome. <a ref='Acts 20:1'>20:1</a> <b>left.</b> Paul departed on his trip to Jerusalem via Greece ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 19:21'>19:21</a></i> ). <b>Macedonia.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 16:9'>16:9</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 20:2'>20:2</a> <b>he had gone through those districts.</b> Macedonia and Achaia ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 19:21'>19:21</a></i> ). <a ref='Acts 20:3'>20:3</a> <b>three months.</b> Most or all of it were likely spent in Corinth. <b>a plot … against him by the Jews.</b> See <a ref='Acts 9:20'>9:20</a> , <a ref='Acts 9:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Acts 13:45'>13:45</a> ; <a ref='Acts 14:2'>14:2</a> , <a ref='Acts 14:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Acts 17:5–9'>17:5–9</a> , <a ref='Acts 17:13'>13</a> ; <a ref='Acts 18:6'>18:6</a> , <a ref='Acts 18:12–13'>12–13</a> ; <a ref='Acts 19:9'>19:9</a> ; <a ref='Acts 21:27–36'>21:27–36</a> ; <a ref='Acts 23:12–15'>23:12–15</a> . Tragically, most of the opposition to Paul’s ministry stemmed from his fellow countrymen (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 11:26'>2Co 11:26</a> ). The Jewish community of Corinth hated Paul because of its humiliating debacle before Gallio ( <a ref='Acts 18:12–17'>18:12–17</a> ), and the stunning conversions of two of its most prominent leaders, Crispus ( <a ref='Acts 18:8'>18:8</a> ) and Sosthenes ( <a ref='Acts 18:17'>18:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:1'>1Co 1:1</a> ). Luke does not record the details of the Jews’ plot, but it undoubtedly involved murdering Paul during the voyage to Syria. The apostle would have been an easy target on a small ship packed with Jewish pilgrims. Because of that danger, Paul canceled his plans to sail from Greece to Syria. Instead, he decided to go north into Macedonia, cross the Aegean Sea to Asia Minor, and catch another ship from there. That delay cost Paul his opportunity to reach Jerusalem in time for Passover; but he hurried to be there in time for Pentecost (v. <a ref='Acts 20:16'>16</a> ). <a ref='Acts 20:4'>20:4</a> <b>Sopater of Berea … Trophimus of Asia.</b> Paul’s traveling companions came from the various provinces in which he had ministered. These men were likely the official representatives of their churches, chosen to accompany Paul as he took the offering to Jerusalem ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 19:21'>19:21</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 16:3–4'>1Co 16:3–4</a> ). <a ref='Acts 20:5'>20:5</a> <b>for us.</b> The first person plural pronoun reveals that Luke rejoined Paul in Philippi (v. <a ref='Acts 20:6'>6</a> ). Being a Gentile, he was able to remain there to minister after Paul and Silas were forced to leave ( <a ref='Acts 16:20'>16:20</a> , <a ref='Acts 16:39–40'>39–40</a> ). This verse begins the second of the three “we passages” in which Luke accompanied Paul on his travels (see Introduction: Author and Date ). <b>Troas.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 16:7–8'>16:7–8</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 20:6'>20:6</a> <b>from Philippi.</b> Paul, along with Luke, and possibly Titus, crossed the Aegean Sea from Philippi to Troas. That crossing, due to unfavorable winds, took 5 days; Paul’s earlier crossing from Troas to Neapolis (Philippi’s port) had taken only two days ( <a ref='Acts 16:11'>16:11</a> ). In Troas, they were reunited with the rest of their party. <b>days of Unleavened Bread.</b> I.e., Passover ( <a ref='Exodus 12:17'>Ex 12:17</a> ). <a ref='Acts 20:7'>20:7</a> <b>first day of the week.</b> Sunday, the day the church gathered for worship, because it was the day of Christ’s resurrection. Cf. <a ref='Matthew 28:1'>Mt 28:1</a> ; <a ref='Mark 16:2'>Mk 16:2</a> , <a ref='Mark 16:9'>9</a> ; <a ref='Luke 24:1'>Lk 24:1</a> ; <a ref='John 20:1'>Jn 20:1</a> , <a ref='John 20:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 16:2'>1Co 16:2</a> . The writings of the early church Fathers confirm that the church continued to meet on Sunday after the close of the NT period. Scripture does not require Christians to observe the Saturday Sabbath: 1) the Sabbath was the sign of the Mosaic Covenant ( <a ref='Exodus 31:16–17'>Ex 31:16–17</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 9:14'>Ne 9:14</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 20:12'>Eze 20:12</a> ), whereas Christians are under the New Covenant ( <a ref='2Co 3'>2Co 3</a> ; <a ref='Heb 8'>Heb 8</a> ); 2) there is no NT command to keep the Sabbath; 3) the first command to keep the Sabbath was not until the time of Moses ( <a ref='Exodus 20:8'>Ex 20:8</a> ); 4) the Jerusalem Council (chap. <a ref='Ac 15'>15</a> ) did not order Gentile believers to keep the Sabbath; 5) Paul never cautioned Christians about breaking the Sabbath; and 6) the NT explicitly teaches that Sabbath keeping was not a requirement ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 14:5'>Ro 14:5</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 4:10–11'>Ga 4:10–11</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 2:16–17'>Col 2:16–17</a></i> ). <b>to break bread.</b> The common meal associated with the communion service ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 11:20–22'>1Co 11:20–22</a> ). <a ref='Acts 20:8'>20:8</a> <b>lamps.</b> The fumes given off by these oil-burning lamps help explain why Eutychus fell asleep (v. <a ref='Acts 20:9'>9</a> ). <b>upper room.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 1:13'>1:13</a> .</i> The early church met in homes ( <a ref='Romans 16:5'>Ro 16:5</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 16:19'>1Co 16:19</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 4:15'>Col 4:15</a> ; <a ref='Philemon 1:2'>Phm 2</a> ); the first church buildings date from the third century. <a ref='Acts 20:9'>20:9</a> <b>young man.</b> The Greek word suggests he was between 7 and 14 years old.

Some have speculated that there were 70 elders, paralleling the Sanhedrin. Given the large size of the Jerusalem church, there probably were at least that many. God had decreed that after the apostles were gone, the church was to be ruled by elders (cf. <a ref='Acts 14:23'>14:23</a> ; <a ref='Acts 20:17'>20:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 5:17'>1Ti 5:17</a> ; <a ref='Titus 1:5'>Tit 1:5</a> ; <a ref='James 5:14'>Jas 5:14</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 5:1'>1Pe 5:1</a> , <a ref='1 Peter 5:5'>5</a> ). <a ref='Acts 21:19'>21:19</a> began to <b>relate one by one.</b> Paul’s official report of his missionary work did not involve meaningless generalities; he related specific incidents from his journeys (cf. <a ref='Acts 11:4'>11:4</a> ).

That Paul had not abandoned Jewish customs is evident from his circumcision of Timothy ( <a ref='Acts 16:1–3'>16:1–3</a> ) and his own taking of a Nazirite vow ( <a ref='Acts 18:18'>18:18</a> ). <a ref='Acts 21:23'>21:23</a> <b>under a vow.</b> A Nazirite vow, symbolizing total devotion to God ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Acts 18:18'>18:18</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 6:1–21'>Nu 6:1–21</a></i> ). <a ref='Acts 21:24'>21:24</a> <b>purify yourself.</b> Having just returned from an extended stay in Gentile lands, Paul was considered ceremonially unclean.

The second charge, that Paul opposed the law, was a very dangerous one, albeit false, in this setting. Originally, Pentecost was a celebration of the first fruits of the harvest. But by this time, it had become a celebration of Moses’ receiving the law on Mt. Sinai. Thus, the Jewish people were especially zealous for the law during this feast. The third charge, of blaspheming or defiling the temple, had helped bring about the deaths of Jesus ( <a ref='Mark 14:57–58'>Mk 14:57–58</a> ) and Stephen ( <a ref='Acts 6:13'>6:13</a> ). All 3 charges were, of course, totally false. <b>brought Greeks into the temple.</b> The Asian Jews accused Paul of having brought Trophimus past the Court of the Gentiles into the part of the temple where Gentiles were forbidden. Such a charge was absurd, for it would have entailed Paul’s risking his friend’s life (the Romans had granted the Jews permission to execute any Gentile who so defiled the temple). <a ref='Acts 21:30'>21:30</a> <b>doors were shut.</b> This was done by the temple guards, since Paul’s death on the temple grounds would defile the temple (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 11:15'>2Ki 11:15</a> ).

The Egyptian was a false prophet who, several years earlier, had promised to drive out the Romans.

His pro-Roman policies alienated him from the Jewish people, who murdered him at the outset of the revolt against Rome (AD 66). <b>commanded … to strike him.</b> An illegal act in keeping with Ananias’ brutal character. The verb translated “strike” is used of the mob’s beating of Paul ( <a ref='Acts 21:32'>21:32</a> ) and the Roman soldiers’ beating of Jesus ( <a ref='Matthew 27:30'>Mt 27:30</a> ). It was no mere slap on the face, but a vicious blow. <a ref='Acts 23:3'>23:3</a> <b>whitewashed wall!</b> Cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 13:10–16'>Eze 13:10–16</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 23:27'>Mt 23:27</a> . <b>in violation of the Law.</b> Outraged by the High Priest’s flagrant violation of Jewish law, Paul flared up in anger. When Jesus was similarly struck in violation of the law, He reacted by calmly asking the reason for the blow ( <a ref='John 18:23'>Jn 18:23</a> ). Paul’s reaction was wrong, as he would shortly admit (v. <a ref='Acts 23:5'>5</a> ). Although an evil man, Ananias still held a God-ordained office, and was to be granted the respect that position demanded. <a ref='Acts 23:4'>23:4</a> <b>revile.</b> Those standing near Paul were appalled by his harsh rebuke of the High Priest. “Revile” is the same word used in <a ref='John 9:28'>Jn 9:28</a> to describe the Jewish leaders’ insulting remarks to the blind man whom Jesus had healed. Peter used it to speak of the abuse Jesus endured ( <a ref='1 Peter 2:23'>1Pe 2:23</a> ). <a ref='Acts 23:5'>23:5</a> <b>I was not aware.</b> Some believe this to be another manifestation of Paul’s eye problems (cf. <a ref='Galatians 4:15'>Ga 4:15</a> ); or that Paul was so angry that he forgot to whom he was speaking; or that he was being sarcastic, since Ananias was not acting like a High Priest should. The simplest explanation is to take Paul’s words at face value. He had been gone from Jerusalem for many years and would not likely have recognized Ananias by sight. That this was an informal gathering of the Sanhedrin ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 22:30'>22:30</a></i> ) would have meant the High Priest would not have been wearing his official garments. <b>it is written.</b> Quoted from <a ref='Exodus 22:28'>Ex 22:28</a> . <a ref='Acts 23:6'>23:6</a> Ananias’ haughty attitude and illegal act convinced Paul he would not receive a fair hearing before the Sanhedrin. Accordingly, he decided on a bold step. As a Pharisee, and possibly a former member of the Sanhedrin ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 26:10'>26:10</a></i> ), Paul was well aware of the tensions between the Sanhedrin’s two factions. He appealed to the Pharisees for support, reminding them that he himself was a Pharisee, and appealing to the major theological difference between them and the Sadducees ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Acts 23:7'>7</a></i> ). Paul thus created a split between the Sanhedrin’s factions. <b>Sadducees … Pharisees.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Matthew 3:7'>Mt 3:7</a> .</i> <b>Sanhedrin.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 4:15'>4:15</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 23:7'>23:7</a> <b>dissension.</b> There were major social, political, and theological differences between the Sadducees and Pharisees. By raising the issue of the resurrection, Paul appealed to the Pharisees for support on perhaps the most important theological difference ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Acts 23:8'>8</a></i> ). Since the resurrection of Jesus Christ is also the central theme of Christianity, this was no cynical ploy on Paul’s part to divide the Sanhedrin over a trivial point of theology. <a ref='Acts 23:8'>23:8</a> <b>Sadducees … Pharisees.</b> The Sadducees accepted only the Pentateuch as divinely inspired Scripture. Since they claimed (wrongly, cf. <a ref='Matthew 22:23–33'>Mt 22:23–33</a> ) that the Pentateuch did not teach that there would be a resurrection, they rejected it. The Pharisees, however, believed in the resurrection and afterlife. Their beliefs were thus closer to Christianity than those of the Sadducees. Significantly, the Scripture records the conversion of Pharisees ( <a ref='Acts 15:5'>15:5</a> ; <a ref='John 3:1'>Jn 3:1</a> ), but not of Sadducees. <a ref='Acts 23:9'>23:9</a> <b>scribes of the Pharisaic party.</b> So intense was their theological disagreement with the Sadducees that they were willing to defend Paul—even though he was a leader of the hated sect of the Christians (cf. <a ref='Acts 24:5'>24:5</a> ). <a ref='Acts 23:11'>23:11</a> <b>the Lord stood at his side.</b> The fifth of 6 visions Paul received in Acts (cf. <a ref='Acts 9:3–6'>9:3–6</a> ; <a ref='Acts 16:9–10'>16:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Acts 18:9–10'>18:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Acts 22:17–18'>22:17–18</a> ; <a ref='Acts 27:23–24'>27:23–24</a> ), all coming at crucial points in his ministry. <b>you must bear witness at Rome.</b> Jesus encouraged Paul by telling him that his desire ( <a ref='Romans 1:9–11'>Ro 1:9–11</a> ; <a ref='Romans 15:23'>15:23</a> ) to visit Rome would be granted. <a ref='Acts 23:12'>23:12</a> <b>bound themselves under a curse.</b> Lit. they “anathematized” themselves (cf. <a ref='Galatians 1:8–9'>Ga 1:8–9</a> ), thus invoking divine judgment if they failed (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 14:44'>1Sa 14:44</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 3:35'>2Sa 3:35</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 19:13'>19:13</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 2:23'>1Ki 2:23</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 6:31'>2Ki 6:31</a> ). <a ref='Acts 23:14'>23:14</a> <b>chief priests and the elders.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Acts 4:23'>4:23</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 16:21'>Mt 16:21</a> . Being Sadducees, they would be more inclined to help the conspirators.

Why he was in Jerusalem, away from the family home in Tarsus, is not known. Nor is it evident why he would want to warn his uncle, since Paul’s family possibly disinherited him when he became a Christian ( <a ref='Philippians 3:8'>Php 3:8</a> ). <b>entered the barracks and reported</b> it <b>to Paul.</b> Since Paul was not under arrest, but merely in protective custody, he was able to receive visitors. <a ref='Acts 23:17'>23:17</a> <b>centurions.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Acts 22:25'>22:25</a> .</i> <a ref='Acts 23:23–24'>23:23–24</a> To foil the conspirators’ plot, avoid a potentially explosive confrontation with the Jews, and save Paul’s life, Lysias realized he had to get the apostle out of Jerusalem and to his superior, Governor Felix in Caesarea. <a ref='Acts 23:23'>23:23</a> <b>soldiers … horsemen … spearmen.</b> The “soldiers” were legionnaires, the elite soldiers of the Roman army; the “horsemen” were from the garrison’s cavalry detachment; and the “spearmen,” or javelin throwers, were soldiers less heavily armed than the legionnaires.

Lysias sought to portray himself in the best possible light before the governor. For that reason, he also neglected to mention his order to have Paul scourged ( <a ref='Acts 22:24'>22:24</a> ), and his mistaken assumption that he was the notorious Egyptian assassin ( <a ref='Acts 21:38'>21:38</a> ). <a ref='Acts 23:29'>23:29</a> <b>questions about their Law.</b> Lysias’ failure to mention any crimes against Roman law was tantamount to declaring Paul innocent. <a ref='Acts 23:30'>23:30</a> <b>to bring charges against him before you.</b> The plot against Paul’s life rendered any further hearings at Jerusalem unsafe, thus requiring Lysias to burden Felix with the case. <a ref='Acts 23:31'>23:31</a> <b>Antipatris.</b> A Roman military post about 40 mi. from Jerusalem.

Felix was a former slave whose brother (a favorite of Emperor Claudius) had obtained for him the position as governor. He was not highly regarded by the influential Romans of his day and accomplished little during his term as governor. He defeated the Egyptian and his followers ( <i>see note on <a ref='Acts 21:38'>21:38</a></i> ), but his brutality angered the Jews and led to his ouster as governor by Emperor Nero two years after Paul’s hearing (v. <a ref='Acts 24:27'>27</a> ). <a ref='Acts 24:5–7'>24:5–7</a> Having dispensed with the obligatory flattery of Felix, Tertullus set forth the specific charges against Paul. They included sedition (a violation of Roman law), sectarianism (a violation of Jewish law), and sacrilege (a violation of God’s law). <a ref='Acts 24:5'>24:5</a> <b>a real pest.</b> This statement, while reflecting the Sanhedrin’s hatred of the apostle and Christianity, was not a specific charge of wrongdoing. <b>Stirs up dissension.</b> The first and (in a Roman court) most serious charge leveled against Paul: sedition (rebellion). The Romans did not tolerate those who incited rebellion (as the Jews present would learn a few years later in AD 66). Had the Jewish leaders been able to substantiate this charge, Paul would have faced severe punishment, possibly even execution. Tertullus carefully avoided naming any specific incidents, since Felix could then have transferred Paul’s case to the governor in whose jurisdiction the incident took place. The Jews wanted Paul tried before a governor over whom they had some influence. <b>Ringleader … sect of the Nazarenes.</b> The second charge brought against Paul was sectarianism (heresy). Tertullus’ contemptuous reference to Christianity as “the sect of the Nazarenes” (cf. <a ref='Acts 6:14'>6:14</a> ; <a ref='John 1:46'>Jn 1:46</a> ; <a ref='John 7:41'>7:41</a> , <a ref='John 7:52'>52</a> ) was intended to portray Paul as the leader of a messianic sect posing a danger to Rome. <a ref='Acts 24:6–8'>24:6–8a</a> <b>he even … before you.</b> Many ancient manuscripts omit this passage, raising the question of whom Tertullus was urging Felix to examine. If the passage is omitted, Tertullus would be asking Felix to examine Paul; but the apostle would merely have denied Tertullus’ false accusations. If the passage is genuine, Tertullus would be falsely accusing Lysias of overstepping his authority by meddling in a proper Jewish legal proceeding. He would then be claiming that an examination of Lysias would confirm the Jewish leaders’ false interpretation of the events. That would help explain Felix’s decision to adjourn the hearing until he sent for Lysias (v. <a ref='Acts 24:22'>22</a> ). <a ref='Acts 24:6'>24:6</a> <b>tried to desecrate the temple.</b> The third accusation leveled against Paul was sacrilege, blasphemy against God. The Jewish leaders, through their spokesman, repeated the false charges of the Asian Jews ( <a ref='Acts 21:28'>21:28</a> ). Trying to whitewash the angry crowd’s savage beating of Paul, they claimed (falsely) to have arrested him. <a ref='Acts 24:7–8'>24:7–8a</a> Another falsehood, intended to shift the blame for the incident. Actually, it was the Jewish mob that was guilty of violence; Lysias put a stop to the riot and rescued Paul. <a ref='Acts 24:10–21'>24:10–21</a> Paul’s third of 6 defenses (cf. <a ref='Acts 22:1–21'>22:1–21</a> ; <a ref='Acts 22:30–23:10'>22:30—23:10</a> ; <a ref='Acts 25:1–12'>25:1–12</a> ; <a ref='Acts 26:1–29'>26:1–29</a> ; <a ref='Acts 28:17–19'>28:17–19</a> ). <a ref='Acts 24:10'>24:10</a> <b>many years. … Judge.</b> Both as governor, and before that during his service under the governor of Samaria.

The only verdict Felix could render consistent with Roman law was not guilty, which would infuriate the Jews, and possibly lead to further trouble. Since as governor, Felix’s primary responsibility was to maintain order, he decided the best decision was no decision, and adjourned the proceedings on the pretext of needing further information from Lysias. <b>commander comes down.</b> Lysias’ written report had already stated that the dispute involved questions of Jewish law ( <a ref='Acts 23:29'>23:29</a> ), and that Paul was not guilty of any crime ( <a ref='Acts 23:29'>23:29</a> ).
