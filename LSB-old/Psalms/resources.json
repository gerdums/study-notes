    "content": "The Psalms Title The entire collection of Psalms is entitled “Praises” in the Hebrew text. Later, rabbis often designated it “The Book of Praises.” The Septuagint (LXX), the Greek translation of the OT, labeled it “Psalms” (cf. “The Book of Psalms” in the NT: <a ref='Luke 20:42'>Lk 20:42</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:20'>Ac 1:20</a> ). The Greek verb from which the noun “psalms” comes basically denotes the “plucking or twanging of strings,” so that an association with musical accompaniment is implied. The English title derives from the Greek term and its background. The Psalms constituted Israel’s ancient, God-breathed ( <a ref='2 Timothy 3:16'>2Ti 3:16</a> ) “hymnbook,” which defined the proper spirit and content of worship. There are 116 psalms that have superscriptions or “titles.” The Hebrew text includes these titles with the verses themselves. When the titles are surveyed individually and studied as a general phenomenon, there are significant indications that they were appended to their respective psalms shortly after composition and that they contain reliable information (cf. <a ref='Luke 20:42'>Lk 20:42</a> ). These titles convey various kinds of information such as authorship, dedication, historical occasion, liturgical assignment to a worship director, liturgical instructions (e.g., what kind of song it is, whether it is to have a musical accompaniment, and what tune to use), plus other technical instructions of uncertain meaning due to their great antiquity. One very tiny, attached Hebrew preposition shows up in the majority of the Psalm titles. It may convey different relationships, e.g., “of,” “from,” “by,” “to,” “for,” “in reference to,” “about.” Sometimes it occurs more than once, even in short headings, usually supplying “of,” or “by,” person X … “to,” or “for,” person Y information. However, this little preposition most frequently indicates the authorship of a psalm, whether “of” David, the accomplished psalmist of Israel, or “by” Moses, Solomon, Asaph, or the sons of Korah. Author and Date From the divine perspective, the Psalter points to God as its author. Approaching authorship from the human side one can identify a collection of more than 7 composers. King David wrote at least 73 of the 150 psalms; the sons of Korah accounted for 10 ( <a ref='Ps 42'>Pss 42</a> , <a ref='Ps 44-49'>44–49</a> , <a ref='Ps 84-85'>84–85</a> , <a ref='Ps 87'>87</a> ); and Asaph contributed 12 ( <a ref='Ps 50'>Pss 50</a> , <a ref='Ps 73-83'>73–83</a> ). Other penmen included Solomon ( <a ref='Ps 72'>Pss 72</a> , <a ref='Ps 127'>127</a> ), Moses ( <a ref='Ps 90'>Ps 90</a> ), Heman ( <a ref='Ps 88'>Ps 88</a> ), and Ethan ( <a ref='Ps 89'>Ps 89</a> ). The remaining 50 psalms remain anonymous in their authorship, although Ezra is thought to be the author of some. The time range of the Psalms extends from Moses, ca. 1410 BC ( <a ref='Ps 90'>Ps 90</a> ), to the late sixth or early fifth century BC post-Exilic period ( <a ref='Ps 126'>Ps 126</a> ), which spans about 900 years of Jewish history. Background and Setting The backdrop for the Psalms is twofold: 1) the acts of God in creation and history, and 2) the history of Israel. Historically, the psalms range in time from the origin of life to the post-Exilic joys of the Jews liberated from Babylon. Thematically, the psalms cover a wide spectrum of topics, ranging from heavenly worship to earthly war. The collected psalms comprise the largest book in the Bible and the most frequently quoted OT book in the NT. <a ref='Ps 117'>Psalm 117</a> represents the middle chapter (out of 1,189) in the Bible. <a ref='Ps 119'>Psalm 119</a> is the largest chapter in the entire Bible. Through the ages, the psalms have retained their original primary purpose, i.e., to engender the proper praise and worship of God. Historical and Theological Themes The basic theme of Psalms is living real life in the real world, where two dimensions operate simultaneously: 1) a horizontal or temporal reality, and 2) a vertical or transcendent reality. Without denying the pain of the earthly dimension, the people of God are to live joyfully and dependently on the Person and promises standing behind the heavenly/eternal dimension. All cycles of human troubles and triumphs provide occasions for expressing human complaints, confidence, prayers, or praise to Israel’s sovereign Lord. In view of this, Psalms presents a broad array of theology, practically couched in day-to-day reality. The sinfulness of man is documented concretely, not only through the behavioral patterns of the wicked, but also by the periodic stumblings of believers. The sovereignty of God is everywhere recognized, but not at the expense of genuine human responsibility. Life often seems to be out of control, and yet all events and situations are understood in the light of divine providence as being right on course according to God’s timetable. Assuring glimpses of a future “God’s day” bolsters the call for perseverance to the end. This book of praise manifests a very practical theology. A commonly misunderstood phenomenon in Psalms is the association that often develops between the “one” (the psalmist) and the “many” (the theocratic people). Virtually all of the cases of this occur in the psalms of King David. There was an inseparable relationship between the mediatorial ruler and his people; as life went for the king, so it went for the people. Furthermore, at times this union accounted for the psalmist’s apparent connection with Christ in the messianic psalms (or messianic portions of certain psalms). The so-called imprecatory (curse pronouncing) psalms may be better understood with this perspective. As God’s mediatorial representative on earth, David prayed for judgment on his enemies, since these enemies were not only hurting him, but were primarily hurting God’s people. Ultimately, they challenged the King of Kings, the God of Israel. Interpretive Challenges It is helpful to recognize certain recurring genres or literary types in the Psalter. Some of the most obvious are: 1) the wisdom type with instructions for right living; 2) lamentation patterns which deal with the pangs of life (usually arising from enemies without); 3) penitential psalms (mostly dealing with the “enemy” within, i.e., sin); 4) kingship emphases (universal or mediatorial; theocratic and/or messianic rule); and 5) thanksgiving psalms. A combination of style and subject matter help to identify such types when they appear. The comprehensive literary characteristic of the psalms is that all of them are poetry par excellence. Unlike most English poetry, which is based on rhyme and meter, Hebrew poetry is essentially characterized by logical parallelisms. Some of the most important kinds of parallelisms are: 1) synonymous (the thought of the first line is restated with similar concepts in the second line, e.g., <a ref='Psalms 2:1'>Ps 2:1</a> ); 2) antithetic (the thought of the second line is contrasted with the first, e.g., <a ref='Psalms 1:6'>Ps 1:6</a> ); 3) climactic (the second and any subsequent lines pick up a crucial word, phrase, or concept and advance it in a stair-step fashion, e.g., <a ref='Psalms 29:1–2'>Ps 29:1–2</a> ); and 4) chiastic or introverted (the logical units are developed in an A … B … B’ … A’ pattern, e.g., <a ref='Psalms 1:2'>Ps 1:2</a> ). On a larger scale, some psalms in their development from the first to the last verse employ an acrostic or alphabetical arrangement. <a ref='Ps 9-10'>Psalms 9–10</a> , <a ref='Ps 25'>25</a> , <a ref='Ps 34'>34</a> , <a ref='Ps 37'>37</a> , <a ref='Ps 111-112'>111–112</a> , <a ref='Ps 119'>119</a> , and <a ref='Ps 145'>145</a> are recognized as either complete or incomplete acrostics. In the Hebrew text, the first letter of the first word of every verse or section begins with a different Hebrew consonant, which advances in alphabetical order until the 22 consonants are exhausted. Such a literary vehicle undoubtedly aided in the memorization of the content and served to indicate that its particular subject matter had been covered from “A to Z.” <a ref='Ps 119'>Psalm 119</a> stands out as the most complete example of this device, since the first letter of each of its 22, 8-verse stanzas moves completely through the Hebrew alphabet. Outline The 150 canonical psalms were organized quite early into 5 “books.” Each of these books ends with a doxology ( <a ref='Psalms 41:13'>Pss 41:13</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 72:18–20'>72:18–20</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:52'>89:52</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 106:48'>106:48</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 150:6'>150:6</a> ). Jewish tradition appealed to the number 5 and alleged that these divisions echoed the Pentateuch, i.e., the 5 books of Moses. It is true that there are clusters of psalms, such as 1) those drawn together by an association with an individual or group (e.g., “The sons of Korah,” <a ref='Ps 42-49'>Pss 42–49</a> ; Asaph, <a ref='Ps 73-83'>Pss 73–83</a> ); 2) those dedicated to a particular function (e.g., “Songs of ascents,” <a ref='Ps 120-134'>Pss 120–134</a> ); 3) those devoted explicitly to praise worship ( <a ref='Ps 146-150'>Pss 146–150</a> ). But no one configuration key unlocks the “mystery” as to the organizing theme of this 5-book arrangement. Thus, there is no identifiable thematic structure to the entire collection of psalms. A brief introduction and outline for each psalm will be provided with the study notes for individual psalms. The following expressions occur often in the Psalms: <b>Selah</b> Possibly indicates <i>Pause, Crescendo</i> or <i>Musical Interlude</i> <b>Maskil</b> Possibly <i>Contemplative</i> , <i>Didactic</i> , or <i>Skillful Psalm</i> <b>Mikhtam</b> Possibly <i>Epigrammatic Poem</i> or <i>Atonement Psalm</i>",

Will He prepare f , N meat for His people?” 21 Therefore Yahweh heard and g was O full of wrath; And a fire was kindled against Jacob And anger also mounted against Israel, 22 Because they P did not believe in God And did not trust in His salvation. 23 Yet He commanded the skies above And Q opened the doors of heaven; 24 He R rained down manna upon them to eat And gave them S grain from heaven. 25 Man ate the bread of h angels; He sent them provision T to satisfy. 26 He U led forth the east wind in the heavens And by His strength He guided the south wind. 27 Then He rained i meat upon them like the dust, Even V winged fowl like the sand of the seas, 28 He caused <i>them</i> to fall in the midst of His camp, All around His dwelling places. 29 So they W ate and were very satisfied, And their desire He brought to them. 30 j Before they had satisfied their desire, X While their food was in their mouths, 31 The Y anger of God rose against them And killed k some of their Z stoutest ones, And l subdued the choice men of Israel. 32 In spite of all this they A still sinned And B did not believe in His wondrous deeds. 33 So He brought C their days to an end in m futility And their years in sudden terror. 34 When He killed them, then they D sought Him, And returned and sought E earnestly for God; 35 And they remembered that God was their F rock, And the Most High God their G Redeemer. 36 But they H deceived Him with their mouth And I lied to Him with their tongue. 37 For their heart was not J prepared <i>to remain</i> with Him, Nor were they faithful in His covenant. 38 But He, being K compassionate, L atoned for <i>their</i> iniquity and did not destroy <i>them</i> ; And He abounded in M turning back His anger And did not arouse all His wrath. 39 Thus N He remembered that they were but O flesh, A n , P wind that goes and does not return. 40 How often they Q rebelled against Him in the wilderness And R grieved Him in the S wasteland! 41 Again and again they o , T tested God, And pained the U Holy One of Israel. 42 They V did not remember W His p power, The day when He X redeemed them from the adversary, 43 When He performed His Y signs in Egypt And His Z miracles in the field of Zoan, 44 And A turned their rivers to blood, And their streams, they could not drink. 45 He sent among them swarms of B flies which devoured them, And C frogs which destroyed them. 46 He gave also their crops to the D grasshopper And the fruit of their labor to the E locust. 47 He killed their vines with F hailstones And their sycamore trees with frost. 48 He gave over their G cattle also to the hailstones And their herds to bolts of lightning. 49 He H sent upon them His burning anger, Fury and indignation and q distress, r A band of destroying angels. 50 He leveled a path for His anger; He did not hold back their soul from death, But I gave over their life to the plague, 51 So He J struck all the firstborn in Egypt, The K first of their vigor in the tents of L Ham. 52 But He M led forth His own people like sheep And guided them in the wilderness N like a flock; 53 He led them O safely, so that they did not fear; But P the sea covered their enemies. 54 So Q He brought them to His holy s land, To this t , R hill country S which His right hand had acquired. 55 He also T drove out the nations before them And U apportioned them for an inheritance by measurement, And made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents. 56 Yet they u , V tested and W rebelled against the Most High God And did not keep His testimonies, 57 But turned back and X acted treacherously like their fathers; They Y turned aside like a treacherous bow. 58 For they Z provoked Him with their A high places And B aroused His jealousy with their C graven images. 59 God heard and v was filled with D wrath And greatly E rejected Israel; 60 So that He F abandoned the G dwelling place at Shiloh, The tent w which He caused to dwell among men, 61 And gave up His H strength to captivity And His beauty I into the hand of the adversary. 62 He also J gave over His people to the sword, And x was filled with wrath at His inheritance. 63 K Fire devoured y His choice men, And y His L virgins had no wedding songs. 64 z His M priests fell by the sword, And a His N widows could not weep. 65 Then the Lord O awoke as <i>if from</i> sleep, As <i>if He were a</i> P warrior b overcome by wine. 66 He Q struck His adversaries backward; He put on them an everlasting reproach. 67 He also R rejected the tent of Joseph, And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim, 68 But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount S Zion which He loved. 69 And He T built His sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which He has founded forever. 70 He also U chose David His servant And took him from the sheepfolds; 71 From V following the c , W nursing ewes He brought him To X shepherd Jacob His people, And Israel Y His inheritance. 72 So he shepherded them according to the Z integrity of his heart, And led them with his skillful hands.",

Salvation is His marvelous work of grace (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 61:3'>Is 61:3</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 15:13'>Mt 15:13</a> ). Yet, there is genuine responsibility in appropriating the abundant resources of God (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 17:8'>Jer 17:8</a> ), which lead to eventual productivity. <a ref='Psalms 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>The wicked are not so.</b> This is an abrupt contrast, lit. “Not so the wicked!” <b>chaff.</b> A frequent OT word picture from harvest time for what is unsubstantial, without value, and worthy only to be discarded. <a ref='Psalms 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>Therefore … not rise.</b> “Therefore” introduces the strong conclusion that the ungodly will not be approved by God’s judgment. <a ref='Psalms 1:6'>1:6</a> <b>Yahweh knows.</b> This is far more than recognition; Yahweh “knows” everything. In this context, the reference is to personal intimacy and involvement with His righteous ones (contra. <a ref='Matthew 7:23'>Mt 7:23</a> ; cf. <a ref='2 Timothy 2:19'>2Ti 2:19</a> ). <b>the way of.</b> The repetition of this phrase picks up on the “path” imagery so characteristic of this psalm. It refers to one’s total course of life, i.e., lifestyle. Here these two courses arrive at the ways of life and death, as in <a ref='Deuteronomy 30:19'>Dt 30:19</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 21:8'>Jer 21:8</a> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 7:13–14'>Mt 7:13–14</a> . <b>will perish.</b> One day the wicked person’s way will end in ruin; a new order is coming and it will be a righteous order. So <a ref='Ps 1'>Ps 1</a> begins with the “blessed” and ends with those who “perish” (cf. <a ref='Psalms 9:5–6'>Pss 9:5–6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 112:10'>112:10</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 2:1–12'>2:1–12</a> Sometimes <a ref='Ps 2'>Ps 2</a> is said to share with <a ref='Ps 1'>Ps 1</a> in the role of introducing the Psalter (cf. “blessed” in <a ref='Psalms 1:1'>1:1</a> and <a ref='Psalms 2:12'>2:12</a> ). Also, it seems that, while the function of <a ref='Ps 1'>Ps 1</a> is to disclose the two different “ways” for individuals, <a ref='Ps 2'>Ps 2</a> follows up with its application to nations. This psalm is normally termed “royal” and has had a long history of messianic interpretation. Although it has no title, it seems to bear the imprint of David’s hand. As such, it fluidly moves from the lesser David through the Davidic dynasty to the Greater David—Jesus Christ. <a ref='Ps 2'>Psalm 2</a> progressively shines its poetic spotlight on 4 vivid scenes relating to the mutiny of mankind against God: I. Scene One: Human Rebellion ( <a ref='Psalms 2:1–3'>2:1–3</a> ) II. Scene Two: Divine Reaction ( <a ref='Psalms 2:4–6'>2:4–6</a> ) III. Scene Three: Divine Rule ( <a ref='Psalms 2:7–9'>2:7–9</a> ) IV. Scene Four: Human Responsibility ( <a ref='Psalms 2:10–12'>2:10–12</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>meditate on a vain thing.</b> This is the irony of man’s depravity—devising, conspiring, and scheming emptiness (cf. <a ref='Psalms 38:12'>Ps 38:12</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 24:2'>Pr 24:2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 59:3'>Is 59:3</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 59:13'>13</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>Against … against.</b> The nations and peoples, led by their kings and rulers (v. <a ref='Psalms 2:1'>1</a> ), direct their hostility toward Yahweh and His anointed one. The consecrated and commissioned mediatorial representative referred to David in a near sense and Messiah, i.e., Christ, in the ultimate sense (cf. <a ref='Acts 4:25–26'>Ac 4:25–26</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 2:3'>2:3</a> <b>their fetters … their cords.</b> Mutinous mankind, instead of understanding that these are God’s love-bonds ( <a ref='Hosea 11:4'>Hos 11:4</a> ), view them as yoke-bonds ( <a ref='Jeremiah 5:5'>Jer 5:5</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 2:5'>2:5</a> <b>Then.</b> After mocking them with the laughter of divine contempt, God speaks and acts from His perfectly balanced anger. <a ref='Psalms 2:6'>2:6</a> <b>I have installed.</b> Their puny challenge (v. <a ref='Psalms 2:3'>3</a> ) is answered by this powerful pronouncement. It’s as good as done: his king will be enthroned on Jerusalem’s most prominent hill. <a ref='Psalms 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>I will … tell of the decree.</b> The installed mediator now recites Yahweh’s previously issued enthronement ordinance. <b>You are My Son.</b> This recalls <a ref='2 Samuel 7:8–16'>2Sa 7:8–16</a> as the basis for the Davidic king. It is the only OT reference to the relation between Father and Son in the Trinity. <b>Today I have begotten You.</b> Rather than a reference to origin (there is no procreation within the Trinity), this vividly conveys the essential oneness shared between the Father and the Son. This verse is quoted in the NT with reference to the birth of Jesus ( <a ref='Hebrews 1:5–6'>Heb 1:5–6</a> ) and also to His resurrection ( <a ref='Acts 13:33–34'>Ac 13:33–34</a> ) as the earthly affirmations. <a ref='Psalms 2:9'>2:9</a> <b>You shall … You shall.</b> The supreme sovereignty of “the King of kings” is pictured in its subjugating might. The shepherd’s “rod” and the king’s “scepter” are the same word in the original. Shepherding and kingly imagery often merged in ancient Near Eastern thought (cf. <a ref='Micah 7:14'>Mic 7:14</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 2:10–12'>2:10–12</a> The tone of these verses is surprising. Instead of immediate judgment, Yahweh and His Anointed mercifully provide an opportunity for repentance. Five commands place responsibility on mutinous mankind. <a ref='Psalms 2:12'>2:12</a> <b>Kiss the Son.</b> This symbolic act would indicate allegiance and submission (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 10:1'>1Sa 10:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 19:18'>1Ki 19:18</a> ). The word for “Son” here is not the Hebrew word for “son” that was used in v. <a ref='Psalms 2:7'>7</a> , but rather its Aramaic counterpart (cf. <a ref='Daniel 7:13'>Da 7:13</a> ), which is a term that would especially be suitable for these commands being addressed to “nations” (v. <a ref='Psalms 2:1'>1</a> ). <b>perish</b> in <b>the way.</b> These words pick up the major burden of <a ref='Ps 1'>Ps 1</a> . <a ref='Psalms 3:1–8'>3:1–8</a> This psalm intermingles both lament and confidence. In its sweeping scope, it becomes a pattern for praise, peace, and prayer amidst pressure. As it unfolds through 3 interrelated historical phenomena, David shares his theological “secret” of having assurance in the face of adversity. I. The Psalmist’s Predicament ( <a ref='Psalms 3:1–2'>3:1–2</a> ) II. The Psalmist’s Peace ( <a ref='Psalms 3:3–6'>3:3–6</a> ) III. The Psalmist’s Prayer ( <a ref='Psalms 3:7–8'>3:7–8</a> ) <a ref='Ps 3'>3:Title</a> The first of 73 psalms attributed to David by superscription. Further information connects its occasion with the Absalom episode ( <a ref='2Sa 15-18'>2Sa 15–18</a> ), although many of its features are more descriptive of persecution in general. <a ref='Psalms 3:1–2'>3:1–2</a> <b>become many … Many … Many.</b> The psalmist begins on a low note with his multiplied miseries. <a ref='Psalms 3:2–3'>3:2–3</a> <b>no salvation for him … But You. … shield about me.</b> There is a strong contrast between the allegation and the psalmist’s assurance. David’s attitude and outlook embraces the theology that Paul summarized in <a ref='Romans 8:31'>Ro 8:31</a> . <a ref='Ps 3'>Psalm 3</a> also introduces Divine Warrior language (cf. <a ref='Ex 15'>Ex 15</a> as a background). <a ref='Psalms 3:5'>3:5</a> <b>I lay down and slept.</b> Since God is known for His sustaining protection, David could relax in the most trying of circumstances.

For example, the former is sometimes labeled a morning psalm (cf. <a ref='Psalms 3:5'>3:5</a> ), while the latter has been called an evening psalm (cf. <a ref='Psalms 4:8'>4:8</a> ). In both, David is besieged with suffering, injustice, and oppression. Additionally, <a ref='Ps 4'>Ps 4</a> also exhibits the changing attitudes of the worshiper in his most difficult circumstances. David’s movement will be from anxiety to assurance as he travels down the road of prayer and trust in God. At the end of yet another day of pressure, pain, and persecution, David engages in 3 conversations which ultimately lead to a point of blessed relaxation: I. Praying to God for Preservation ( <a ref='Psalms 4:1'>4:1</a> ) II. Reasoning with His enemies about Repentance ( <a ref='Psalms 4:2–5'>4:2–5</a> ) III. Praising God for True Perspective ( <a ref='Psalms 4:6–8'>4:6–8</a> ) <a ref='Ps 4'>4:Title</a> <a ref='Ps 4'>Psalm 4</a> introduces the first of 55 assignments to the master, director, or chief overseer of worship services in its title. Further instruction is given in the direction “with stringed instruments.” The chief musician, therefore, was to lead the great choir and the string portion of the orchestra in this celebration of worship. <a ref='Psalms 4:1'>4:1</a> <b>O God of my righteousness!</b> The ultimate basis for divine intervention resides in God, not in the psalmist. On union with God’s righteousness based on His mercy, see <a ref='Jeremiah 23:6'>Jer 23:6</a> (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:30'>1Co 1:30</a> ). <b>distress.</b> This is an important word for trying circumstances in the psalms. It pictures the psalmist’s plight as being in straits, i.e., painfully restricted. Here his testimony to God’s historical salvation, “You have relieved me,” conveys the picture that his Lord had provided space or room for him. <a ref='Psalms 4:2–3'>4:2–3</a> God’s agenda for David (v. <a ref='Psalms 4:3'>3</a> ) is radically contrasted with that of his enemies (v. <a ref='Psalms 4:2'>2</a> ). The term for “holy” or “pious” in the OT is above all else indicating a person blessed by God’s grace. <a ref='Psalms 4:4'>4:4</a> <b>Tremble, and do not sin.</b> In this context, the admonition means to tremble or shake in the fear of Yahweh so as not to sin (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 32:10–11'>Is 32:10–11</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 3:16'>Hab 3:16</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 4:5'>4:5</a> <b>trust.</b> This command reflects the primary word group in the OT for faith-commitment. <a ref='Psalms 4:6–8'>4:6–8</a> The taunting skeptics are cut off by the testimony of the psalmist to his rest because of God’s personal blessings. <a ref='Psalms 4:8'>4:8</a> <b>abide in safety.</b> The word “safety” introduces a play on words by going back to the term “trust” in v. <a ref='Psalms 4:5'>5</a> . David evidences a total confidence in God amidst his crisis. <a ref='Psalms 5:1–12'>5:1–12</a> <a ref='Ps 5'>Psalm 5</a> is basically a lament with elements of declarations of innocence and confidence and prayers for protection. David was standing in the presence of Yahweh when he put his enemies before his God. His prayers have two major concerns: “Help me and harm them!” Therefore, David releases his respective prayers for divine intervention and imprecation upon two rounds of contrast which differentiate the enemies of God from the children of God. I. Round One: Theological Contrast of Retribution with Reconciliation ( <a ref='Psalms 5:1–8'>5:1–8</a> ) A. David’s Prayer for Intervention Expressed ( <a ref='Psalms 5:1–3'>5:1–3</a> ) B. David’s Prayer for Intervention Explained ( <a ref='Psalms 5:4–8'>5:4–8</a> ) II. Round Two: Practical Contrast of the Wayward with the Worshipful ( <a ref='Psalms 5:9–12'>5:9–12</a> ) A. David’s Prayer of Imprecation Expressed ( <a ref='Psalms 5:10'>5:10a–c</a> ) B. David’s Prayer of Imprecation Explained ( <a ref='Psalms 5:9'>5:9</a> , <a ref='Psalms 5:10–12'>10d–12</a> ) <a ref='Ps 5'>5:Title</a> Whereas the instructions to the worship leader in <a ref='Ps 4'>Ps 4</a> pertain to a stringed accompaniment, <a ref='Ps 5'>Ps 5</a> is to be celebrated in community worship with flute accompaniment (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 10:5'>1Sa 10:5</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 1:40'>1Ki 1:40</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 30:29'>Is 30:29</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 5:1'>5:1</a> <b>Give ear.</b> This command is built upon the word for “ear.” It takes its place alongside of parallel requests that God would pay careful attention to the supplicant and his sufferings ( <a ref='Psalms 17:1'>Pss 17:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 55:1–2'>55:1–2</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 5:2'>5:2</a> <b>my King and my God.</b> David may have been the anointed theocratic king on earth, but he fully understood that the ultimate King of all Israel and of the whole earth is God (for God’s conditional allowance for mediatorial kingship, see <a ref='1 Samuel 8:19'>1Sa 8:19ff.</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 5:3'>5:3</a> <b>In the morning … In the morning.</b> These words have led many to label this a morning psalm (cf. <a ref='Psalms 3:5'>Ps 3:5</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 5:4–6'>5:4–6</a> <b>not … not … not … hate … destroy … abhors.</b> These 3 negatively phrased descriptions follow 3 directly stated affirmations. This reveals God’s perfect standard of justice both in principle and in practice. <a ref='Psalms 5:7'>5:7</a> <b>But as for me.</b> The psalmist starkly contrasts himself with his enemies. They are haughty; he is humble. <a ref='Psalms 5:8–9'>5:8–9</a> To man’s “hoof” problem, David exposes man’s “mouth” problem, with special application to his slick-talking enemies. Proverbs is especially given to exposing the deadliness of mankind’s spiritual “hoof” and “mouth” disease, i.e., one’s walk and talk. Paul includes these assessments from <a ref='Psalms 5:9'>Ps 5:9</a> in his list of 14 terrible indictments of all mankind in <a ref='Romans 3:13'>Ro 3:13</a> . <a ref='Psalms 5:8'>5:8</a> <b>lead me … Make Your way straight.</b> Disciples are to walk in God’s way(s), being obedient to His direction(s) for their lives, yet they are fully dependent upon His grace for responsible progress (cf. <a ref='Psalms 119:1–5'>Ps 119:1–5</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:26–27'>26–27</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:30'>30</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:32–33'>32–33</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 5:10–12'>5:10–12</a> He prays for the just ends of the wicked according to God’s revealed standard of justice ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:1'>Dt 25:1</a> ), and contrastingly urges those who are regarded as righteous by Yahweh’s grace to joyfully celebrate His blessings. <a ref='Psalms 6:1–10'>6:1–10</a> This lament seems to be quite intensive, for apparently David is sleepless. His circumstances seem hopeless and helpless. The early Christian church regarded this psalm as the first among the “penitential psalms” (cf. <a ref='Ps 32'>Pss 32</a> , <a ref='Ps 38'>38</a> , <a ref='Ps 51'>51</a> , <a ref='Ps 102'>102</a> , <a ref='Ps 130'>130</a> , <a ref='Ps 143'>143</a> ). David’s cries, coming up from the depths of his personal pit of persecution, indicate a radical change in his frame of mind as he addresses two different audiences. I. Pouring out His Soul before God: A Defeatist Frame of Mind ( <a ref='Psalms 6:1–7'>6:1–7</a> ) A. A Tone of Helplessness ( <a ref='Psalms 6:1–4'>6:1–4</a> ) B. A Tone of Hopelessness ( <a ref='Psalms 6:5–7'>6:5–7</a> ) II. Turning His Attention to His Enemies: A Defiant Frame of Mind ( <a ref='Psalms 6:8–10'>6:8–10</a> ) A. His Boldness about It ( <a ref='Psalms 6:8'>6:8a</a> ) B. His Basis for It ( <a ref='Psalms 6:8–10'>6:8b–10</a> ) <a ref='Ps 6'>6:Title</a> A new musical direction appears, lit. “upon an eight,” indicating either “upon an eight-stringed lyre” or “upon the octave” (i.e., a lower bass melody to accompany these lyrics of intense lament). <a ref='Psalms 6:1'>6:1</a> <b>in Your anger … in Your wrath.</b> He does not ask for immunity from judgment, but for the tempering of God’s discipline with mercy. <a ref='Psalms 6:2'>6:2</a> , <a ref='Psalms 6:7'>7</a> <b>bones … eye.</b> Many assume that because the psalmist mentions bodily “parts” his affliction was a grave physical illness. Obviously, his circumstances would have had an effect on his physical dimension. However, in OT anthropology such references are picturesque metaphors for an affliction of his total being (cf. all the parallel, personal references, e.g., “me,” “my soul,” i.e., my being or person, “I,” etc.). <a ref='Psalms 6:3'>6:3</a> <b>how long?</b> This is a common exclamation of intense lament (cf. <a ref='Psalms 90:13'>Ps 90:13</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 2:6'>Hab 2:6</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 6:10'>Rev 6:10</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 6:4'>6:4</a> <b>rescue my soul … Your lovingkindness.</b> This introduces a new synonym for salvation, connoting an action of drawing off or out. He desires Yahweh to graciously extricate him (cf. <a ref='Job 36:15'>Job 36:15</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 18:19'>Pss 18:19</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 116:8'>116:8</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 6:5'>6:5</a> <b>no remembrance of You.</b> There is much about “death” and “the grave,” i.e., Sheol, in Psalms. Such language as that of v. <a ref='Psalms 6:5'>5</a> does not imply annihilation, but inability to participate temporally in public praise offerings (cf. Hezekiah’s reasoning in <a ref='Isaiah 38:18'>Is 38:18</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 6:6–7'>6:6–7</a> Sleep has eluded him because of his severe sorrow. <a ref='Psalms 6:8–10'>6:8–10</a> Out of his dire straits, boldness surprisingly breaks through as he addresses his enemies. This boldness also has only one basis, that the psalmist’s confidence is wholly grounded upon his Lord’s attention and ultimate intervention. <a ref='Psalms 7:1–17'>7:1–17</a> This psalm is basically a plea for divine vindication in the light of the oppressor’s allegations and actions. David’s confidence in the Divine Judge is the backbone of <a ref='Ps 7'>Ps 7</a> (cf. Abraham in <a ref='Genesis 18:25'>Ge 18:25</a> ). As this truth grips him more and more, he will move from a tense anxiety to a transcendent assurance. This psalm follows David through 3 progressively calming stages of expression in response to the painfully false accusations that were being hurled against him. I. Stage One: David’s Concern as He Passionately Begs the Attention of the Divine Judge ( <a ref='Psalms 7:1–5'>7:1–5</a> ) II. Stage Two: David’s Court Appearance as He Painstakingly Argues His Case before the Divine Judge ( <a ref='Psalms 7:6–16'>7:6–16</a> ) III. Stage Three: David’s Composure as He Patiently Waits for the Verdict of the Divine Judge ( <a ref='Psalms 7:17'>7:17</a> ) <a ref='Ps 7'>7:Title</a> This title introduces one of the more enigmatic terms found in superscriptions of the psalms—“a Shiggaion (Hebrew) of David.” It is probably related to the idea of wondering, reeling, veering, or weaving. Consequently, the term may also indicate the song’s irregularity in rhythm (cf. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:1'>Hab 3:1</a> ). “He sang” also indicates that this was a vocal solo. The occasion, “concerning … Cush, a Benjamite,” cannot be readily identified from the historical books; however, whoever this was or whatever the name represented, some enemy had obviously been falsely charging David (cf. Shimei— <a ref='2 Samuel 16:5'>2Sa 16:5</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 19:16'>19:16</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 7:2'>7:2</a> <b>tear my soul like a lion.</b> Often the psalmist’s enemies are symbolized by vicious, attacking animals, with “the king of beasts” occurring frequently ( <a ref='Psalms 10:9'>Pss 10:9</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 17:12'>17:12</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 22:13'>22:13</a> , <a ref='Psalms 22:16'>16</a> , <a ref='Psalms 22:21'>21</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 7:3–5'>7:3–5</a> Such self-pronounced curses are powerful protestations of innocence (not sinlessness) in the context of being falsely charged (cf. the boldness of Job in <a ref='Job 31:5'>31:5ff.</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 7:6'>7:6</a> <b>Arise.</b> The battle cry relating back to <a ref='Numbers 10:35'>Nu 10:35</a> recurs (cf. <a ref='Psalms 9:19'>Pss 9:19</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 10:12'>10:12</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 17:13'>17:13</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 44:26'>44:26</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 102:13'>102:13</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 7:8'>7:8</a> <b>my righteousness … my integrity.</b> These are not declarations of sinlessness but of innocence in this “court case.” <a ref='Psalms 7:9'>7:9</a> <b>the righteous God tests the hearts and minds.</b> The Just Judge has perfect insight (cf. God examining the heart and mind in <a ref='Jeremiah 17:10'>Jer 17:10</a> ; also cf. <a ref='Acts 1:24'>Ac 1:24</a> ; <a ref='Acts 15:8'>15:8</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 7:11–13'>7:11–13</a> This shows yet another blending of the Divine Warrior and Divine Judge themes. <a ref='Psalms 7:14–16'>7:14–16</a> Often the principle of exact retribution surfaces in the psalms (cf. the maxim of <a ref='Proverbs 26:27'>Pr 26:27</a> and the judgment of <a ref='Habakkuk 2:15–18'>Hab 2:15–18</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 8:1–9'>8:1–9</a> The beginning and ending of the psalm suggest that it is essentially a hymn of praise. Yet, a major portion qualifies it as a so-called nature psalm, i.e., a psalm of creation. Furthermore, there is a significant focus on the created dignity of man. Through this vehicle, the important subject of Adamic theology comes to the forefront, making this psalm ultimately suitable to the important association of the “One,” the Last Adam, i.e., Christ and the “many” (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 2:6–8'>Heb 2:6–8</a> ). Structurally, <a ref='Ps 8'>Ps 8</a> ’s beginning and concluding bursts of praise are driven by David’s contemplation of two pairs of radical contrasts. I. Introductory Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 8:1'>8:1</a> ) II. Two Pairs of Radical Contrasts ( <a ref='Psalms 8:2–8'>8:2–8</a> ) A. Between the Nature of “Infants” and Infidels ( <a ref='Psalms 8:2'>8:2</a> ) B. Between Unaided General Revelation and Unveiled Special Revelation ( <a ref='Psalms 8:3–8'>8:3–8</a> ) III. Concluding Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 8:9'>8:9</a> ) <a ref='Ps 8'>8:Title</a> Another instrument is referenced in this title, most probably a guitar-like harp associated with Gath in Philistia. <a ref='Psalms 8:1'>8:1</a> <b>Yahweh … Lord.</b> Of these twin nouns of direct address to God, the first is His specially revealed name Yahweh ( <a ref='Exodus 3:14'>Ex 3:14</a> ) and the second puts an emphasis on His sovereignty. <b>Your name.</b> The name of God refers to the revealed Person of God, encompassing all of His attributes. <a ref='Psalms 8:2'>8:2</a> The introductory irony about infants sets the stage for a contrast between the dependent and the foolishly self-sufficient. <a ref='Psalms 8:3'>8:3</a> <b>Your heavens, the work of Your fingers.</b> The heavens are created by God ( <a ref='Psalms 33:6'>Pss 33:6</a> , <a ref='Psalms 33:9'>9</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 102:25'>102:25</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 136:5'>136:5</a> ). The anthropomorphism “Your fingers” miniaturizes the magnitude of the universe in the presence of the Creator. <a ref='Psalms 8:4–6'>8:4–6</a> Quoted in the NT at <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:27–28'>1Co 15:27–28</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:22'>Eph 1:22</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 2:5–10'>Heb 2:5–10</a> . <a ref='Psalms 8:4'>8:4</a> <b>What is man.</b> If the whole universe is diminutive in the sight of the Divine Creator, how much less is the significance of mankind! Even the word for “man” used in v. <a ref='Psalms 8:4'>4</a> alludes to his weakness (cf. <a ref='Psalms 9:19–20'>Pss 9:19–20</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 90:3'>90:3a</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 103:15'>103:15</a> , etc.). <b>And the son of man.</b> This phrase also looks upon man as insignificant and transitory (e.g., <a ref='Psalms 90:3'>Ps 90:3b</a> ). Yet, the Aramaic counterpart of this phrase is found in <a ref='Daniel 7:13'>Da 7:13</a> , which has profound messianic overtones (cf. also Jesus’ favorite self-designation in the NT, Son of Man). <a ref='Psalms 8:5–8'>8:5–8</a> These verses consistently emphasize the significance of man, who was created in the image and likeness of God to exercise dominion over the rest of creation ( <a ref='Genesis 1:26–28'>Ge 1:26–28</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 9:1–20'>9:1–20</a> <a ref='Ps 9'>Psalms 9</a> and <a ref='Ps 10'>10</a> go together, so much so that early Greek and Lat. vss. treat and number them as one. However, <a ref='Ps 9'>Pss 9</a> and <a ref='Ps 10'>10</a> evidence two different forms: the first is an individual hymn, while the second is an individual lament. In the first part (vv. <a ref='Psalms 9:1–12'>1–12</a> ) praise is prominent, and in the second part (vv. <a ref='Psalms 9:13–20'>13–20</a> ) prayer is prominent. Many subtle patterns weave the thoughts of its verses and lines together. Shifting back and forth between the individual and corporate perspectives is characteristic, as are introverted (i.e., chiastic) structures. Basically, David’s hymn in <a ref='Ps 9'>Ps 9</a> ebbs and flows through two respective tides of prayer and praise. I. First Tide: Divine Justice and Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 9:1–12'>9:1–12</a> ) A. Individual Praise and Divine Justice ( <a ref='Psalms 9:1–4'>9:1–4</a> ) B. Divine Justice and Corporate Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 9:5–12'>9:5–12</a> ) II. Second Tide: Divine Justice and Prayer ( <a ref='Psalms 9:13–20'>9:13–20</a> ) A. Individual Prayer and Divine Justice ( <a ref='Psalms 9:13–16'>9:13–16</a> ) B. Divine Justice and Corporate Prayer ( <a ref='Psalms 9:17–20'>9:17–20</a> ) <a ref='Ps 9'>9:Title</a> The new element of this title lit. reads “Death to the Son.” Many conjectures have arisen about this puzzling phrase, but it is safest to regard these words as designating a particular tune. <a ref='Psalms 9:1–2'>9:1–2</a> <b>I will. … will. … will. … will.</b> These 4 “I wills” launch <a ref='Ps 9'>Ps 9</a> with David’s dedication to exuberant worship of Yahweh. <a ref='Psalms 9:1'>9:1</a> <b>Your wondrous deeds.</b> This especially references God’s extraordinary interventions into history on behalf of His people (cf. the Exodus events). <a ref='Psalms 9:4'>9:4</a> <b>You have maintained my justice and my cause.</b> This is exactly what God is known to do (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:18'>Dt 10:18</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 8:45'>1Ki 8:45</a> , <a ref='1 Kings 8:49'>49</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 9:5–10'>9:5–10</a> Verses <a ref='Psalms 9:5'>5</a> and <a ref='Psalms 9:6'>6</a> reveal the Just Judge’s dealings with the godless, vv. <a ref='Psalms 9:7–8'>7–8</a> , His dealings with all men in general, and vv. <a ref='Psalms 9:9–10'>9–10</a> , His gracious dealings with dependent disciples. <a ref='Psalms 9:11'>9:11</a> <b>Yahweh, who abides in Zion.</b> There is a both/and tension running throughout the OT, i.e., God is enthroned in and above the heavens, and also, He symbolically dwells locally in His tabernacle (cf. <a ref='1Ki 8'>1Ki 8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 11:4'>Ps 11:4</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 9:12'>9:12</a> , <a ref='Psalms 9:18'>18</a> <b>the afflicted … the needy … the afflicted.</b> These designations often stand for the individual psalmist and/or the corporate community of disciples he represents. The terms all point to those who are afflicted, vulnerable, and, therefore, totally dependent upon Yahweh. <a ref='Psalms 9:15–16'>9:15–16</a> The “boomerang” principle of exact retribution returns. <a ref='Psalms 9:17–20'>9:17–20</a> Prominent theological themes from <a ref='Ps 1'>Pss 1</a> and <a ref='Ps 2'>2</a> also return as the psalmist draws this great hymn to a climax. <a ref='Psalms 10:1–18'>10:1–18</a> Whereas <a ref='Ps 9'>Ps 9</a> started out with praise, <a ref='Ps 10'>Ps 10</a> begins in despair. In <a ref='Ps 9'>Ps 9</a> the psalmist was confident of the sure coming of Divine justice; in <a ref='Ps 10'>Ps 10</a> injustice is rampant and God seems disinterested. However, the psalmist’s walking more by sight than by faith will slowly turnaround as he shifts his focus from empirical observations to theological facts. This is not an easy turn-around, especially since he is surrounded by so many practical atheists (cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 10:4'>4</a> , <a ref='Psalms 10:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Psalms 10:13'>13</a> ). But hope will begin to dawn for the helpless (e.g., v. <a ref='Psalms 10:12'>12</a> ). In view of such kinds of general observations, the psalmist’s expressions in <a ref='Ps 10'>Ps 10</a> exemplify how true believers seem to live in two different worlds at the same time. I. From His World of Hostility, Discouragement ( <a ref='Psalms 10:1–11'>10:1–11</a> ) II. From His World of Hope, Encouragement ( <a ref='Psalms 10:12–18'>10:12–18</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 10:1'>10:1</a> <b>Why. … Why…?</b> Two “whys” of lament boldly blurt out the psalmist’s question: “God, why do You remain aloof?” (cf. <a ref='Psalms 13:1'>Pss 13:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 22:11'>22:11</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 38:21'>38:21</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 44:24'>44:24</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 71:12'>71:12</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 88:14'>88:14</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 10:3'>10:3</a> <b>curses … spurns.</b> The wicked’s <i>modus operandi</i> is the opposite of what God demands ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 25:1'>Dt 25:1</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 10:5'>10:5</a> <b>His ways prosper at all times.</b> God seems to be rewarding the ruthless. The psalmist’s questioning insinuation is, “Has God also abandoned His own standards for retribution and reward?” Cf. other why-do-the-wicked-prosper inquiries in <a ref='Job 20:2'>Job 20:2ff.</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 12:1'>Jer 12:1</a> . <a ref='Psalms 10:7–11'>10:7–11</a> Evidences of “hoof” and “mouth” disease (walk/talk) return in application to the wicked. These are enhanced by a return also of the ungodly being described as stalking, rapacious beasts. <a ref='Psalms 10:12'>10:12</a> <b>Arise.</b> The battle cry of <a ref='Numbers 10:35'>Nu 10:35</a> also comes back again (cf. <a ref='Psalms 7:6'>Pss 7:6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 9:19'>9:19</a> ). <b>lift up Your hand.</b> This is an idiom for God’s strength and power especially as it is used in the context of retaliation. <a ref='Psalms 10:14'>10:14</a> <b>helper of the orphan.</b> God is pictured as Helper or Advocate again, but this time in association with orphans. He is the Defender par excellence of the defenseless (on the imagery, cf. <a ref='Exodus 22:21'>Ex 22:21ff.</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:18'>Dt 10:18ff.</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 1:17'>1Sa 1:17</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 7:6'>Jer 7:6</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 10:15'>10:15</a> <b>Break the arm of the wicked.</b> The “hand” of God (vv. <a ref='Psalms 10:12'>12</a> , <a ref='Psalms 10:14'>14</a> ) is more than sufficiently strong to shatter the arm (another figure for power) of ungodly men. <a ref='Psalms 10:16–18'>10:16–18</a> The confident mood of this great climax outshines the psalm’s introductory protestations. The psalmist’s great Lord listens (v. <a ref='Psalms 10:17'>17</a> ) and acts (v. <a ref='Psalms 10:18'>18</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 11:1–7'>11:1–7</a> The panic that launched this psalm was not David’s but that of his apparently well-meaning counselors. Their mood is panic, but David’s is peace. In view of David’s attitude, this psalm can be listed with the psalms of confidence ( <a ref='Ps 4'>Pss 4</a> , <a ref='Ps 16'>16</a> , <a ref='Ps 23'>23</a> , <a ref='Ps 27'>27</a> , <a ref='Ps 62'>62</a> , <a ref='Ps 125'>125</a> , <a ref='Ps 131'>131</a> ). Also, the solidarity of the theocratic king and the theocratic people is obvious, as indicated by the shifts back and forth between sing. and pl. phrasings. The developing verses and lines of this psalm reveal that, although two different “voices” were speaking to David in yet another context of personal and national crisis, he had made up his mind to trust only in Yahweh. I. Introductory Affirmation ( <a ref='Psalms 11:1'>11:1a</a> ) II. The Two Voices A. The Voice Urging Flight ( <a ref='Psalms 11:1–3'>11:1b–3</a> ) B. The Voice Urging Faith ( <a ref='Psalms 11:4–7'>11:4–7</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 11:1'>11:1</a> <b>In Yahweh I take refuge.</b> God is the exclusive refuge for His persecuted children (cf. <a ref='Psalms 16:1'>Pss 16:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 36:7'>36:7</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 11:3'>11:3</a> These are the words of a committed but confused saint. His philosophical problem is, “In view of the crumbling of the theocratic society, what can one righteous person, out of a shrinking remnant, do?” <a ref='Psalms 11:4'>11:4a</a> <b>in His holy temple … in heaven.</b> This emphasizes the transcendent throne room of God, yet God has sovereign sway over all the affairs of earth (cf. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:20'>Hab 2:20</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 11:4–5'>11:4b–5a</a> <b>His eyes behold, His eyelids test.</b> His transcendence previously depicted does not negate His eminence here presented from the perspective of the divine scrutiny of all men, including the righteous (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 6:27–30'>Jer 6:27–30</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 17:10'>17:10</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 11:5–6'>11:5b–6</a> <b>His soul hates.</b> This is undiluted, perfect retribution. <a ref='Psalms 11:7'>11:7a</a> <b>For Yahweh is righteous.</b> He loves righteousness. He Himself is the perfect norm or standard for all spiritual integrity. <a ref='Psalms 11:7'>11:7b</a> <b>His face.</b> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 17:15'>Pss 17:15</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 27:4'>27:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 63:2'>63:2</a> ; <a ref='1 John 3:2'>1Jn 3:2</a> . <a ref='Psalms 12:1–8'>12:1–8</a> Men’s words do hurt, but Yahweh’s words heal. These thoughts preoccupy David in <a ref='Ps 12'>Ps 12</a> . The psalm begins and ends with the reality of the current reign of the wicked. Yet amidst this very black setting, the gemstone truth of v. <a ref='Psalms 12:5'>5</a> shines all the more brightly. These 8 verses are characterized by subtle repetitions and bold contrasts. In the development of <a ref='Ps 12'>Ps 12</a> , David provides a model for passing a spiritual hearing test, in that genuine disciples listen to and properly respond to two radically different sources of speech. I. Surviving the Propaganda of Depraved Speech ( <a ref='Psalms 12:1–4'>12:1–4</a> ) A. By Prayer ( <a ref='Psalms 12:1–2'>12:1–2</a> ) B. By Petition ( <a ref='Psalms 12:3–4'>12:3–4</a> ) II. Security in the Protection of Divine Speech ( <a ref='Psalms 12:5–8'>12:5–8</a> ) A. Its Divine Promises ( <a ref='Psalms 12:5'>12:5</a> ) B. Its Divine Purity ( <a ref='Psalms 12:6'>12:6</a> ) C. Its Divine Perseverance ( <a ref='Psalms 12:7–8'>12:7–8</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 12:1'>12:1</a> <b>for the holy man ceases.</b> His words and phraseology are deliberately hyperbolic, yet David’s perception indeed was that the pious have perished! <a ref='Psalms 12:2–4'>12:2–4</a> These smooth-talking sinners verbally abuse the remnant (vv. <a ref='Psalms 12:2–3'>2–3</a> ) and verbally defy their Sovereign (v. <a ref='Psalms 12:4'>4</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 12:3'>12:3a</a> <b>May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips.</b> Here is a call for death in the light of sin. On the obnoxious sin of lying lips, cf. <a ref='Psalms 5:9'>Ps 5:9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 30:10'>Is 30:10</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 11:32'>Da 11:32</a> ; <a ref='Romans 3:13'>Ro 3:13</a> . <a ref='Psalms 12:6'>12:6</a> <b>pure … refined.</b> Yahweh’s perfect words present a most radical contrast with the profane words of arrogant sinners. The purity of God’s Person assures the purity of His promises (cf. <a ref='Psalms 19:7–10'>Ps 19:7–10</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 12:7–8'>12:7–8</a> The hostile realities of v. <a ref='Psalms 12:8'>8</a> call for the heavenly resources of v. <a ref='Psalms 12:7'>7</a> . <a ref='Psalms 13:1–6'>13:1–6</a> <a ref='Ps 13'>Psalm 13</a> launches with an explosion of 4 “How longs?” indicating another lament is about to begin. But David will shift radically from turmoil to tranquility in the space of 6 short verses through 3 levels of attitude. I. Below “Sea Level” Expressions of Despair ( <a ref='Psalms 13:1–2'>13:1–2</a> ) II. “Sea Level” Expressions of Desires ( <a ref='Psalms 13:3–4'>13:3–4</a> ) III. “Mountaintop Level” Expressions of Delight ( <a ref='Psalms 13:5–6'>13:5–6</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 13:1–2'>13:1–2</a> These lines reintroduce the familiar triangle of the psalmist, his God, and his enemies. This 3-way relationship produces perplexity and pain. In view of God’s apparent absence (v. <a ref='Psalms 13:1'>1</a> ), he seems left to his own resources which are unable to deal with the reality of his enemies (v. <a ref='Psalms 13:2'>2</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 13:4–5'>13:4b–5b</a> <b>rejoice … rejoice.</b> Using the same verb, he deliberately contrasts his enemy’s celebration with his own confidence in divine deliverance. <a ref='Psalms 14:1–7'>14:1–7</a> <a ref='Ps 14'>Psalm 14</a> , a wisdom poem, along with its nearly identical twin <a ref='Ps 53'>Ps 53</a> , contains profound deliberations on human depravity. David’s representative desire for deliverance (v. <a ref='Psalms 14:7'>7</a> ) provides the chorus to his two preceding dirges on depravity. I. The Dirges on Depravity ( <a ref='Psalms 14:1–6'>14:1–6</a> ) A. The First Dirge: In the Form of a Round, Addresses the Universality of Depravity ( <a ref='Psalms 14:1–3'>14:1–3</a> ) B. The Second Dirge: In the Form of a Ballad, Addresses the Futility of Depravity ( <a ref='Psalms 14:4–6'>14:4–6</a> ) II. The Chorus on Deliverance ( <a ref='Psalms 14:7'>14:7</a> ) A. The Wish for It ( <a ref='Psalms 14:7'>14:7a</a> ) B. The Worship Attending It ( <a ref='Psalms 14:7'>14:7b–c</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 14:1'>14:1</a> <b>The … fool.</b> In the Bible, this designation carries moral rather than intellectual meaning ( <a ref='Isaiah 32:6'>Is 32:6</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 14:1–3'>14:1–3</a> The “alls” and “no ones” of these lines make the indictments universally applicable. No wonder Paul included these indictments in <a ref='Romans 3:10–12'>Ro 3:10–12</a> . There is also a common scriptural association of doing with thinking. <a ref='Psalms 14:4–6'>14:4–6</a> The shift from third person affirmations about the wicked (vv. <a ref='Psalms 14:4–5'>4–5</a> ) to the second person (v. <a ref='Psalms 14:6'>6a</a> ) intensifies this confrontation with divine judgment. <a ref='Psalms 14:7'>14:7</a> <b>Zion.</b> The place on earth where God was pleased to reveal His presence, protection, and power (cf. <a ref='Psalms 3:4'>Pss 3:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 20:2'>20:2</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 128:5'>128:5</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 132:13'>132:13</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 134:3'>134:3</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 15:1–5'>15:1–5</a> Whereas <a ref='Ps 14'>Ps 14</a> focused on the way of the wicked, <a ref='Ps 15'>Ps 15</a> concentrates on the way of the righteous (cf. <a ref='Ps 1'>Ps 1</a> ). The saved sinner is described as exhibiting indications of ethical integrity. These characteristics alternate in triplets of positive and negative descriptions. The whole psalm unfolds through a question-and-answer vehicle, and indeed it may be regarded as the ultimate Q and A session. With its focus on moral responsibility, the psalm offers a sequence of responses to the question of acceptable worship. I. A Two-Part Question ( <a ref='Psalms 15:1'>15:1</a> ) II. A Twelve-Part Response ( <a ref='Psalms 15:2–5'>15:2–5b</a> ) A. Three Positively Phrased Ethical Characteristics ( <a ref='Psalms 15:2'>15:2</a> ) 1. His lifestyle exhibits integrity 2. His deeds exhibit justice 3. His speech exhibits reliability B. Three Negatively Cast Ethical Characteristics ( <a ref='Psalms 15:3'>15:3</a> ) 1. He does not tread over people with his tongue 2. He does not harm his fellow man 3. He does not dump reproach upon family or friend C. Three Positively Phrased Ethical Characteristics ( <a ref='Psalms 15:4'>15:4a–c</a> ) 1. He views the reprobate as rejected 2. He respects the people of God 3. He holds himself accountable D. Three Negatively Cast Ethical Characteristics ( <a ref='Psalms 15:4–5'>15:4d–5b</a> ) 1. He is not fickle 2. He is not greedy 3. He cannot be bought III. A One-Part Guarantee ( <a ref='Psalms 15:5'>15:5c</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 15:1'>15:1</a> <b>Your tent.</b> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 61:4'>Ps 61:4</a> ; for possible background see <a ref='2 Samuel 6:12–17'>2Sa 6:12–17</a> . <a ref='Psalms 15:2–5'>15:2–5</a> Notice the focus on life-and-lip qualities. <a ref='Psalms 15:4'>15:4</a> <b>despised … honors.</b> Whom God rejects, the psalmist rejects; whom God loves, he loves. <a ref='Psalms 15:5'>15:5</a> <b>interest.</b> Interest rates ran as high as 50 percent, but God’s law put strict regulations on borrowing and lending ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:19–20'>Dt 23:19–20</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:10–13'>24:10–13</a></i> ). <b>He … will never be shaken.</b> This is an important promise in the light of its usage in Psalms and Proverbs (cf. <a ref='Psalms 10:6'>Pss 10:6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 13:4'>13:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 16:8'>16:8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 46:5'>46:5</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 62:2'>62:2</a> , <a ref='Psalms 62:6'>6</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 10:30'>Pr 10:30</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 16:1–11'>16:1–11</a> The only prayer of <a ref='Ps 16'>Ps 16</a> comes in the first line. The rest of the psalm consists of David’s weaving together his personal testimonies of trust in Yahweh. In view of this, David’s opening prayer is bolstered by two cycles of testimony. I. David’s Introductory Prayer ( <a ref='Psalms 16:1'>16:1</a> ) II. David’s Testimony ( <a ref='Psalms 16:2–11'>16:2–11</a> ) A. His Testimony of Communion ( <a ref='Psalms 16:2–4'>16:2–4</a> ) 1. Its divine dimension ( <a ref='Psalms 16:2'>16:2</a> ) 2. Its human dimension ( <a ref='Psalms 16:3–4'>16:3–4</a> ) B. His Testimony of Confidence ( <a ref='Psalms 16:5–11'>16:5–11</a> ) 1. Its past and present dimensions ( <a ref='Psalms 16:5–8'>16:5–8</a> ) 2. Its present and future dimensions ( <a ref='Psalms 16:9–11'>16:9–11</a> ) <a ref='Ps 16'>16:Title</a> <b>A Mikhtam of David.</b> Cf. <a ref='Ps 56-60'>Pss 56–60</a> . In spite of many conjectures, this designation remains obscure. <a ref='Psalms 16:1'>16:1</a> <b>Keep me.</b> This is a frequent request begging God to protect the psalmist (cf. <a ref='Psalms 17:8'>Pss 17:8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 140:4'>140:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 141:9'>141:9</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 16:2'>16:2</a> <b>I have no good without You.</b> I.e., “My well-being is entirely dependent upon You.” <a ref='Psalms 16:4'>16:4</a> He will have nothing to do with false gods or the people pursuing them. <a ref='Psalms 16:5–6'>16:5–6</a> These lines use OT metaphors to describe the blessing of God. <a ref='Psalms 16:9'>16:9</a> <b>my glory.</b> Starting back at v. <a ref='Psalms 16:7'>7</a> , the psalmist referred to his core of being as “my mind,” then “my heart,” now “my glory,” and next “My flesh” and “my soul.” The anthropological terms stand for the whole person, so it is best to consider “my glory” as referring to that distinctive way in which man is created in the image of God, i.e., his intelligence and ability to speak. <a ref='Psalms 16:10'>16:10</a> These words expressed the confidence of the lesser David, but were applied messianically to the resurrection of the Greater David (the Lord Jesus Christ) both by Peter ( <a ref='Acts 2:25–28'>Ac 2:25–28</a> ) and Paul ( <a ref='Acts 13:35'>Ac 13:35</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 17:1–15'>17:1–15</a> This “prayer” of David brims with petitions, as many as seventeen of them depending upon the translation of certain Hebrew verb forms. There are many literary parallels with <a ref='Ps 16'>Ps 16</a> . Although the psalm shows indications of mixed forms, it is essentially a prayer for protection. David is fond of using themes and phrases from the Exodus narrative (cf. <a ref='Ex 15'>Ex 15</a> ; <a ref='De 32'>Dt 32</a> ). A logical chiastic development is detected in its verses, with the focus shifting from the psalmist (vv. <a ref='Psalms 17:1–8'>1–8</a> ) to his enemies (vv. <a ref='Psalms 17:9–12'>9–12</a> ), remaining on his enemies in vv. <a ref='Psalms 17:13–14'>13–14</a> , then shifting back to David (v. <a ref='Psalms 17:15'>15</a> ). Or viewing its development from another angle, David approaches the divine court with 3 clusters of appeals in seeking justice. I. Appeals Dealing with Response and Recognition ( <a ref='Psalms 17:1–5'>17:1–5</a> ) II. Appeals Dealing with Rescue and Relief ( <a ref='Psalms 17:6–12'>17:6–12</a> ) A. His Need for Rescue Is Presented ( <a ref='Psalms 17:6–8'>17:6–8</a> ) B. His Need for Relief Is Documented ( <a ref='Psalms 17:9–12'>17:9–12</a> ) III. Appeals Dealing with Retribution and Rest ( <a ref='Psalms 17:13–15'>17:13–15</a> ) A. His Anticipation of Their Retribution ( <a ref='Psalms 17:13–14'>17:13–14</a> ) B. His Assurance of His Own Rest ( <a ref='Psalms 17:15'>17:15</a> ) <a ref='Ps 17'>17:Title</a> This is the first psalm simply entitled “A Prayer” (cf. <a ref='Ps 86'>Pss 86</a> , <a ref='Ps 90'>90</a> , <a ref='Ps 102'>102</a> , <a ref='Ps 142'>142</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 17:1–2'>17:1–2</a> The introductory language is that of the law court, and David stands before the ultimate Chief Justice to present his case. <a ref='Psalms 17:3–5'>17:3–5</a> His basic integrity (vv. <a ref='Psalms 17:3–4'>3–4</a> ) especially in view of the present case, was, is, and shall be dependent upon the grace of God (v. <a ref='Psalms 17:5'>5</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 17:8'>17:8</a> <b>the apple of the eye.</b> An expression meaning the pupil of the human eye. As a person protects that vital organ of vision, so God protects His people. <a ref='Psalms 17:10'>17:10</a> <b>They have closed their unfeeling</b> heart. Lit. “They have closed their fat.” This was a common OT idiom for insensitivity (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:15'>Dt 32:15</a> ; <a ref='Job 15:27'>Job 15:27</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 73:7'>Ps 73:7</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 5:28'>Jer 5:28</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 17:13'>17:13</a> Divine Warrior language. <a ref='Psalms 17:14–15'>17:14–15</a> The common grace of God is overlooked by those who are satisfied with temporal prosperities (v. <a ref='Psalms 17:14'>14</a> ), but David brings back the proper perspective on true satisfaction in v. <a ref='Psalms 17:15'>15</a> . Cf. Jesus’ teaching on these vital issues in <a ref='Matthew 6:19–34'>Mt 6:19–34</a> . <a ref='Psalms 18:1–50'>18:1–50</a> <a ref='Ps 18'>Psalm 18</a> is clearly an individual psalm of thanksgiving, also bearing royal characteristics. Its poetry and themes resemble other ancient testimonies to God’s great historical deliverances (e.g., <a ref='Ex 15'>Ex 15</a> ; <a ref='Jdg 5'>Jdg 5</a> ). Between David’s opening (vv. <a ref='Psalms 18:1–3'>1–3</a> ) and closing (vv. <a ref='Psalms 18:46–50'>46–50</a> ) praises to God, his life with Yahweh is described in 3 stages. I. Prelude: His Opening Praises ( <a ref='Psalms 18:1–3'>18:1–3</a> ) II. The Stages of His Life ( <a ref='Psalms 18:4–45'>18:4–45</a> ) A. In the Pit of Peril ( <a ref='Psalms 18:4–19'>18:4–19</a> ) 1. His desperation ( <a ref='Psalms 18:4–5'>18:4–5</a> ) 2. His defender ( <a ref='Psalms 18:6–15'>18:6–15</a> ) 3. His deliverance ( <a ref='Psalms 18:16–19'>18:16–19</a> ) B. On a Course of Ethical Integrity ( <a ref='Psalms 18:20–28'>18:20–28</a> ) 1. The principles of Yahweh’s direction ( <a ref='Psalms 18:20–26'>18:20–26</a> ) 2. The privileges of Yahweh’s direction ( <a ref='Psalms 18:27–28'>18:27–28</a> ) C. In the Turbulent Atmosphere of Leadership ( <a ref='Psalms 18:29–45'>18:29–45</a> ) 1. Military leadership ( <a ref='Psalms 18:29–42'>18:29–42</a> ) 2. Theocratic leadership ( <a ref='Psalms 18:43–45'>18:43–45</a> ) III. Postscript: His Closing Praises ( <a ref='Psalms 18:46–50'>18:46–50</a> ) <a ref='Ps 18'>18:Title</a> This large psalm bears a large title. Although the title seems to refer to only one specific occasion (e.g., “in the day”), it does state that God’s deliverance was “from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.” Therefore, it is preferable that the language of this superscription be understood to summarize the testimony of David’s whole life in retrospect. <a ref='Psalms 18:1'>18:1</a> <b>love.</b> This is not the normal word for love that often bears covenant meaning (e.g., <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:8'>Dt 7:8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 119:97'>Ps 119:97</a> ), but it is a rare verb form of a word group that expresses tender intimacy. David’s choice of words intended to express very strong devotion, like Peter’s in <a ref='John 21:15–17'>Jn 21:15–17</a> . <a ref='Psalms 18:2'>18:2</a> Military metaphors for the Divine Warrior multiply in this verse. Both defensively and offensively, Yahweh was all David needed in life’s tough battles.

His presence is largely described by various catastrophic responses by all creation. <a ref='Psalms 18:16–19'>18:16–19</a> His sheer power, exhibited so dramatically in vv. <a ref='Psalms 18:7–15'>7–15</a> , is now amazingly attested as coming to rescue the psalmist personally. <a ref='Psalms 18:20–24'>18:20–24</a> , <a ref='Psalms 18:37–38'>37–38</a> These verses should not be taken out of context, making David look like an arrogant boaster. As in vv. <a ref='Psalms 18:25–36'>25–36</a> and <a ref='Psalms 18:39–50'>39–50</a> , both David and the community, although responsible for living with integrity within the covenant relationship, are fully dependent on the resources of God to do so. Therefore, his “boasting” is biblical, since it is ultimately in Yahweh ( <a ref='Jeremiah 9:23–24'>Jer 9:23–24</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 18:31'>18:31</a> <b>a rock.</b> Cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 18:2'>2</a> , <a ref='Psalms 18:46'>46</a> . Moses, at the beginning of his great song about Yahweh in <a ref='De 32'>Dt 32</a> , called God “The Rock” (v. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:4'>4</a> ). Yahweh is indeed a massive, unshakable foundation and source of protection. <a ref='Psalms 18:50'>18:50</a> This concluding verse is another royal messianic affirmation of the Davidic Covenant in <a ref='2Sa 7'>2Sa 7</a> . <a ref='Psalms 19:1–14'>19:1–14</a> Because of its two distinct parts and two different names for God, some have tried to argue that <a ref='Ps 19'>Ps 19</a> was really two compositions, one ancient and one more recent. However, the shorter form of the name “God” (cf. the longer form in <a ref='Genesis 1:1'>Ge 1:1</a> ) speaks of His power, especially power exhibited as Creator, while “Yahweh” fits the relational focus. Consequently, David depicted the Lord God as author of both His world and Word in a unified hymn. God has revealed Himself to mankind through these two avenues. The human race stands accountable to Him because of His non-verbal and verbal communications. In the light of these intentions, <a ref='Ps 19'>Ps 19</a> eloquently summarizes two prominent vehicles of God’s self-disclosure. I. God’s General Self-Disclosure in the World ( <a ref='Psalms 19:1–6'>19:1–6</a> ) A. The Publication of the Skies ( <a ref='Psalms 19:1–4'>19:1–4b</a> ) B. The Prominence of the Sun ( <a ref='Psalms 19:4–6'>19:4c–6</a> ) II. God’s Special Self-Disclosure in the Word ( <a ref='Psalms 19:7–14'>19:7–14</a> ) A. The Attributes of the Word ( <a ref='Psalms 19:7–9'>19:7–9</a> ) B. An Appreciation for the Word ( <a ref='Psalms 19:10–11'>19:10–11</a> ) C. The Application of the Word ( <a ref='Psalms 19:12–14'>19:12–14</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 19:1–6'>19:1–6</a> The testimony of the universe comes forth consistently and clearly, but sinful mankind persistently resists it. For this reason, general revelation cannot convert sinners, but it does make them highly accountable (cf. <a ref='Romans 1:18'>Ro 1:18ff.</a> ). Salvation comes ultimately only through special revelation, i.e., as the Word of God is effectually applied by the Spirit of God. <a ref='Psalms 19:1'>19:1</a> <b>heavens … expanse.</b> Both are crucial elements of the creation in <a ref='Ge 1'>Ge 1</a> (cf. vv. <a ref='Genesis 1:1'>1</a> , <a ref='Genesis 1:8'>8</a> ). <b>telling … declaring.</b> Both verbs emphasize the continuity of these respective disclosures. <b>work of His hands.</b> An anthropomorphism illustrating God’s great power (cf. the “work of Your fingers” in <a ref='Psalms 8:3'>Ps 8:3</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 19:2–3'>19:2–3</a> <b>speech … no speech.</b> This is not a contradiction, but shows that the constant communication of the heavens is not with words of a literal nature. <a ref='Psalms 19:4'>19:4</a> The message of the created world extends to everywhere. <a ref='Psalms 19:4–6'>19:4c–6</a> Neither the sun nor the heavens are deified as was the case in many pagan religions. In the Bible, God is the Creator and Ruler over all creation. <a ref='Psalms 19:7–14'>19:7–14</a> The scene shifts from God’s world to God’s Word. <a ref='Psalms 19:7–8'>19:7–8</a> Each of 4 parallel lines contains a word (a synonym) for God’s Word; each describes what His Word is; and each pronounces what it effectually accomplishes. <a ref='Psalms 19:7'>19:7</a> <b>law.</b> This might better be translated, “His teaching,” “a direction,” or “instruction” (cf. <a ref='Psalms 1:2'>Ps 1:2</a> ). <b>testimony.</b> This word for the Word derives from the root “to bear witness.” It, so to speak, bears testimony to its Divine Author. <a ref='Psalms 19:8'>19:8</a> <b>precepts.</b> This synonym looks upon God’s Word as orders, charges, statutes, etc. They are viewed as the Governor’s governings. <b>commandment.</b> This word is related to the verb “to command” or “order.” The Word is therefore also perceived as divine orders. <a ref='Psalms 19:9'>19:9</a> <b>fear.</b> This is not technically a word for the Word, but it does reflect the reality that Scripture is the manual for worship of God. <b>judgments.</b> This term looks upon God’s Word as conveying His judicial decisions. <a ref='Psalms 19:12–13'>19:12–13</a> The psalmist deals respectively with unintentional sins and high-handed infractions (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 4:1'>Lv 4:1ff.</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 15:22'>Nu 15:22ff.</a> ). David’s concerns reflect the attitude of a maturing disciple who, by God’s grace and provisions, deals with his sins and does not deny them. <a ref='Psalms 19:14'>19:14</a> <b>Be acceptable.</b> Using a term often associated with God’s acceptance of properly offered, literal sacrifices, he asks for grace and enablement as he lays his “lip-and-life” sacrifices on the “altar” (cf. <a ref='Joshua 1:8'>Jos 1:8</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 20:1–9'>20:1–9</a> <a ref='Ps 20'>Psalms 20</a> and <a ref='Ps 21'>21</a> are twin warfare events— <a ref='Ps 20'>Ps 20</a> is mostly ceremony before a battle, while <a ref='Ps 21'>Ps 21</a> is mostly celebration after a battle. In the theocracy, these were to be considered holy wars with the chain of command being as follows: Yahweh is Commander-in-Chief over the anointed king-general and the theocratic people—soldiers. All holy convocations, both before and after battles, involved prayer and praise assemblies dedicated to God, who grants victories through the theocratic king-general. <a ref='Ps 20'>Psalm 20</a> , in anticipation of a military campaign, commemorates a 3-phased ceremony regularly conducted by the people in the presence of the Commander-in-Chief on behalf of the king-general. I. An Offering of Their Prayers ( <a ref='Psalms 20:1–5'>20:1–5</a> ) II. A Confirmation of Their Confidence ( <a ref='Psalms 20:6–8'>20:6–8</a> ) III. A Reaffirmation of Their Dependence ( <a ref='Psalms 20:9'>20:9</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 20:1'>20:1</a> <b>May Yahweh answer you in the day of distress!</b> This is the prayer of God’s people for their king-general (cf. “His anointed,” v. <a ref='Psalms 20:6'>6</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 20:2'>20:2</a> <b>from the sanctuary … from Zion.</b> These are designations about the place of God’s symbolic presence in the ark which David had recaptured and installed in a tabernacle on Mt. Zion. The people’s wish was that Yahweh Himself would uphold, support, and sustain the king-general with His extending, powerful presence throughout the military campaign. <a ref='Psalms 20:5'>20:5</a> <b>your salvation.</b> Here, by contrast, God’s salvation is victory in battle. <a ref='Psalms 20:7'>20:7</a> <b>Some</b> boast <b>in …</b> Trust, boast, and praise must not be directed to the wrong objects but only to God Himself (cf., e.g., <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:16'>Dt 17:16</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 20:1–4'>20:1–4</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 26:7–8'>Lv 26:7–8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 33:16–17'>Ps 33:16–17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 31:1–3'>Is 31:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 9:23–24'>Jer 9:23–24</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 4:6'>Zec 4:6</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 20:9'>20:9</a> This verse could also be rendered: “Lord, grant victory to the king! Answer us when we call!” <a ref='Psalms 21:1–13'>21:1–13</a> The first part of <a ref='Ps 21'>Ps 21</a> is a thanksgiving for victory; the last part is an anticipation of future victories in Yahweh through the king-general. Two scenarios of victory provide a context for praise and prayer to the Commander-in-Chief of Israel’s king-general. I. A Present-Past Scenario of Praise: Grounded upon Victories Accomplished in Yahweh ( <a ref='Psalms 21:1–6'>21:1–6</a> ) II. A Present-Future Scenario of Prayer and Praise: Grounded upon Victories Anticipated in Yahweh ( <a ref='Psalms 21:7–13'>21:7–13</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 21:2'>21:2</a> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 20:4'>Ps 20:4</a> , the before; <a ref='Psalms 21:2'>Ps 21:2</a> , the after. <a ref='Psalms 21:3'>21:3</a> <b>You set a crown of fine gold on his head.</b> This is symbolic of superlative blessing (note the reversal in <a ref='Ezekiel 21:25–27'>Eze 21:25–27</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 21:4'>21:4</a> The first part of the verse most likely pertains to preservation of life in battle, and the second part to perpetuation of the dynasty (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 7:13'>2Sa 7:13</a> , <a ref='2 Samuel 7:16'>16</a> , <a ref='2 Samuel 7:29'>29</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:4'>Pss 89:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 132:12'>132:12</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 21:5–6'>21:5–6</a> The King had given great prominence to the king-general. <a ref='Psalms 21:7'>21:7</a> <b>For the king.</b> The human responsibility dimension of the previous divine blessings is identified as the king-general’s dependent trust in God. But the sovereign grace of God provides the ultimate basis for one not being moved or “shaken” (cf. <a ref='Psalms 15:5'>Pss 15:5</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 16:8'>16:8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 17:5'>17:5</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 10:30'>Pr 10:30</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 21:8'>21:8</a> <b>Your … you.</b> Without denying the mediatorship of the king-general, these delineations obviously put the spotlight upon the Commander-in-Chief. <a ref='Psalms 22:1–31'>22:1–31</a> This psalm presents the reader with a great contrast in mood. Lament characterizes the first 21 verses, while praise and thanksgiving describe the last 10 verses. Prayer accounts for this dramatic shift from lament to praise. It is the story of first being God-forsaken and then God-found and filled. It was applied immediately to David and ultimately to the Greater David, Messiah. The NT contains 15 messianic quotations of or allusions to this psalm, leading some in the early church to label it “the fifth Gospel.” I. The Psalmist’s Hopelessness ( <a ref='Psalms 22:1–10'>22:1–10</a> ) A. His Hopelessness and National History ( <a ref='Psalms 22:1–5'>22:1–5</a> ) B. His Hopelessness and Natal History ( <a ref='Psalms 22:6–10'>22:6–10</a> ) II. The Psalmist’s Prayer ( <a ref='Psalms 22:11–21'>22:11–21</a> ) A. A No-Help Outlook ( <a ref='Psalms 22:11–18'>22:11–18</a> ) B. A Divine-Help Outlook ( <a ref='Psalms 22:19–21'>22:19–21</a> ) III. The Psalmist’s Testimonies and Worship ( <a ref='Psalms 22:22–31'>22:22–31</a> ) A. An Individual Precipitation of Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 22:22–25'>22:22–25</a> ) B. A Corporate Perpetuation of Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 22:26–31'>22:26–31</a> ) <a ref='Ps 22'>22:Title</a> <b>Aijeleth Hashshahar.</b> This unique phrase in the superscription is probably best taken as a tune designation. <a ref='Psalms 22:1'>22:1</a> This heavy lament rivals <a ref='Job 3'>Job 3</a> ; <a ref='Ps 69'>Ps 69</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 20:14–18'>Jer 20:14–18</a> . <b>My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?</b> The repeated noun of direct address to God reflects a personal molecule of hope in a seemingly hopeless situation. “Forsaken” is a strong expression for personal abandonment, intensely felt by David and supremely experienced by Christ on the cross ( <a ref='Matthew 27:46'>Mt 27:46</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 22:2–5'>22:2–5</a> The thrust of these verses is “even though You have not responded to me, You remain the Holy One of Israel who has demonstrated His gracious attention time and time again to Your people.” <a ref='Psalms 22:6–8'>22:6–8</a> Reproach and ridicule were overwhelming the psalmist. For messianic applications, cf. <a ref='Matthew 27:39–44'>Mt 27:39–44</a> ; <a ref='Luke 23:35'>Lk 23:35</a> . <a ref='Psalms 22:7'>22:7</a> <b>They smack</b> their <b>lip.</b> An idiom for sneering (cf. <a ref='Job 16:10'>Job 16:10</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 35:21'>Ps 35:21</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 5:5'>Heb 5:5</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 22:8'>22:8</a> <b>Commit … to Yahweh.</b> Lit. “he rolled to Yahweh.” The idea is that he turned his burden over to Yahweh (cf. <a ref='Psalms 37:5'>Ps 37:5</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 16:3'>Pr 16:3</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 22:9–10'>22:9–10</a> The psalmist had a long history of reliance upon God. <a ref='Psalms 22:12–13'>22:12–13</a> This imagery of enemies as rapacious beasts returns (cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 22:16'>16</a> , <a ref='Psalms 22:20–21'>20–21</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 22:14–15'>22:14–15</a> These are graphic images showing that his vitality and courage had left him. <a ref='Psalms 22:16'>22:16</a> <b>They pierced my hands and my feet.</b> The Hebrew text reads “like a lion,” i.e., these vicious attacking enemies, like animals, have torn me. Likely, a messianic prediction with reference to crucifixion (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 53:5'>Is 53:5</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 12:10'>Zec 12:10</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 22:17'>22:17</a> This is a graphic picture of emaciation and exhaustion (cf. <a ref='Job 33:21'>Job 33:21</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 102:5'>Ps 102:5</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 22:18'>22:18</a> <b>They divide … they cast.</b> All 4 Gospel writers appeal to this imagery in describing Christ’s crucifixion ( <a ref='Matthew 27:35'>Mt 27:35</a> ; <a ref='Mark 15:24'>Mk 15:24</a> ; <a ref='Luke 23:34'>Lk 23:34</a> ; <a ref='John 19:24'>Jn 19:24</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 22:21'>22:21</a> <b>You have answered me.</b> A welcomed breaking of God’s silence finally arrives. This is fully in keeping with His character (cf. <a ref='Psalms 20:6'>Pss 20:6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 28:6'>28:6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 31:22'>31:22</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 118:5'>118:5</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 22:22'>22:22</a> The psalmist cannot contain himself; he must testify loudly in the great assembly of God’s great mercies. His exuberance is meant to be contagious (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 2:12'>Heb 2:12</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 22:27'>22:27</a> His testimony expands by soliciting universal praises for universal divine blessings (cf. <a ref='Psalms 67:7'>Pss 67:7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 98:3'>98:3</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 23:1–6'>23:1–6</a> This psalm is probably the best-known passage of the OT. It is a testimony by David to Yahweh’s faithfulness throughout his life. As a hymn of confidence, it pictures Yahweh as a disciple’s Shepherd-King-Host. David, by using some common ancient Near Eastern images in <a ref='Ps 23'>Ps 23</a> , progressively unveils his personal relationship with Yahweh in 3 stages. I. David’s Exclamation: “Yahweh Is My Shepherd” ( <a ref='Psalms 23:1'>23:1a</a> ) II. David’s Expectations ( <a ref='Psalms 23:1–5'>23:1b–5b</a> ) A. “I Shall Not Want” ( <a ref='Psalms 23:1–3'>23:1b–3</a> ) B. “I Fear No Evil” ( <a ref='Psalms 23:4–5'>23:4–5b</a> ) III. David’s Exultation: “My Cup Overflows” ( <a ref='Psalms 23:5–6'>23:5c–6</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 23:1'>23:1</a> <b>Yahweh is my shepherd.</b> Cf. <a ref='Genesis 48:15'>Ge 48:15</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 49:24'>49:24</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:6–12'>Dt 32:6–12</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 28:9'>Pss 28:9</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 74:1'>74:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 77:20'>77:20</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 78:52'>78:52</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 79:13'>79:13</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 80:1'>80:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 95:7'>95:7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 100:3'>100:3</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 40:11'>Is 40:11</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:3'>Jer 23:3</a> ; <a ref='Eze 34'>Eze 34</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 4:16'>Hos 4:16</a> ; <a ref='Micah 5:4'>Mic 5:4</a> ; <a ref='Micah 7:14'>7:14</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 9:16'>Zec 9:16</a> on the image of Yahweh as a Shepherd. This imagery was used commonly in kingly applications and is frequently applied to Jesus in the NT (e.g., <a ref='Jn 10'>Jn 10</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 13:20'>Heb 13:20</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:25'>1Pe 2:25</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 5:4'>5:4</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 23:2–3'>23:2–3</a> Four characterizing activities of Yahweh as Shepherd (i.e., emphasizing His grace and guidance) are followed by the ultimate basis for His goodness, i.e., “His name’s sake” (cf. <a ref='Psalms 25:11'>Pss 25:11</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 31:3'>31:3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 106:8'>106:8</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 43:25'>Is 43:25</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 48:9'>48:9</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 36:22–32'>Eze 36:22–32</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 23:4'>23:4</a> <b>the valley of the shadow of death.</b> Phraseology used to convey a perilously threatening environment (cf. <a ref='Job 10:21–22'>Job 10:21–22</a> ; <a ref='Job 38:17'>38:17</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 44:19'>Pss 44:19</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 107:10'>107:10</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 2:6'>Jer 2:6</a> ; <a ref='Luke 1:79'>Lk 1:79</a> ). <b>Your rod and Your staff.</b> The shepherd’s club and crook are viewed as comforting instruments of protection and direction, respectively. <a ref='Psalms 23:5–6'>23:5–6</a> The able Protector (v. <a ref='Psalms 23:4'>4</a> ) is also the abundant Provider. <a ref='Psalms 23:5'>23:5</a> <b>You have anointed.</b> The biblical imagery of anointing is frequently associated with blessing ( <a ref='Psalms 45:7'>Pss 45:7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 92:10'>92:10</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 104:15'>104:15</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 133:2'>133:2</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 9:8'>Ecc 9:8</a> ; <a ref='Amos 6:6'>Am 6:6</a> ; <a ref='Luke 7:46'>Lk 7:46</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 23:6'>23:6</a> <b>And I will dwell.</b> There is some question concerning the form in the Hebrew text (cf. also <a ref='Psalms 27:4'>Ps 27:4</a> ). Should it be rendered “I shall return” or “I shall dwell”? Whichever way it is taken, by the grace of his Lord, David is expecting ongoing opportunities of intimate fellowship. <a ref='Psalms 24:1–10'>24:1–10</a> The form of <a ref='Ps 24'>Ps 24</a> has been disputed. For example, it has been labeled by some as an entrance ceremony (cf. <a ref='Ps 15'>Ps 15</a> ), by others, a hymn of praise, and yet by others, a mixture of both elements. Its occasion has also been contended; however, the view that it might have been used at the time of the bringing of the ark to Jerusalem ( <a ref='2 Samuel 6:12–19'>2Sa 6:12–19</a> ; <a ref='1Ch 13'>1Chr 13</a> ) still has credible appeal. The early church designated it messianically as an ascension psalm (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 24:3'>3</a> ). The movement of the psalm seems to follow the movement of the people. It traces the community’s worship procession, both spatially and spiritually, through 3 progressive stages. I. Stage One: Worship of the Creator through Contemplation ( <a ref='Psalms 24:1–2'>24:1–2</a> ) II. Stage Two: Worship of the Savior through Consecration ( <a ref='Psalms 24:3–6'>24:3–6</a> ) A. The Probing Questions Inviting Consecration ( <a ref='Psalms 24:3'>24:3</a> ) B. The Proper Qualities Indicating Consecration ( <a ref='Psalms 24:4–6'>24:4–6</a> ) III. Stage Three: Worship of the King through Commemoration ( <a ref='Psalms 24:7–10'>24:7–10</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 24:1'>24:1</a> <b>Yahweh’s.</b> On His universal ownership, cf. <a ref='Exodus 19:5'>Ex 19:5</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:14'>Dt 10:14</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 50:12'>Pss 50:12</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:11'>89:11</a> ; in the NT, cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:21'>1Co 3:21</a> , <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:23'>23</a> . <a ref='Psalms 24:2'>24:2</a> This is a poetic, not a scientific, picture of creation (cf. <a ref='Genesis 1:9–10'>Ge 1:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 7:11'>7:11</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 49:25'>49:25</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 20:4'>Ex 20:4</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:13'>Dt 33:13</a> ; <a ref='Job 26:10'>Job 26:10</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 74:13'>Pss 74:13</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 136:6'>136:6</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 3:5'>2Pe 3:5</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 24:3'>24:3</a> In the liturgy, the questions were most likely asked by the priest. The worshipers would have then responded antiphonally with the “answers.” On the form, cf. <a ref='Ps 15'>Ps 15</a> and <a ref='Isaiah 33:14–16'>Is 33:14–16</a> . <a ref='Psalms 24:4'>24:4</a> These sample qualities do not signify sinless perfection, but rather basic integrity of inward motive and outward manner. <a ref='Psalms 24:7–9'>24:7–9</a> These are bold personifications indicating that the city gates need to stretch themselves to make way for the awesome entrance of the Great King. By so doing, they too participate in worshiping Him. <a ref='Psalms 24:10'>24:10</a> <b>Yahweh of hosts.</b> The Divine Warrior possibly comes back into consideration; He, the Commander-in-Chief, is “the God of the armies” (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 17:45'>1Sa 17:45</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 25:1–22'>25:1–22</a> David grapples with the heavy issues of life, avoiding denial and affirming dependence. He must trust God in the face of his troubles and troublemakers. These 22 verses follow an acrostic development. On a larger scale, the psalm develops chiastically: Verses <a ref='Psalms 25:1–7'>1–7</a> and <a ref='Psalms 25:16–22'>16–22</a> are parallel sections of prayers for protection and/or deliverance, while the core, vv. <a ref='Psalms 25:8–15'>8–15</a> , contains affirmations about God and about His dealings with believers. I. Prayers in Times of Trial ( <a ref='Psalms 25:1–7'>25:1–7</a> ) II. Praise in Periods of Confidence ( <a ref='Psalms 25:8–15'>25:8–15</a> ) III. Petition for Help in Trouble ( <a ref='Psalms 25:16–22'>25:16–22</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 25:1'>25:1</a> <b>I lift up my soul.</b> This is a vivid picture of David’s dependence (cf. <a ref='Psalms 86:4'>Pss 86:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 143:8'>143:8</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 25:2–3'>25:2–3</a> <b>ashamed.</b> The important phenomenon of shame for the wicked and no shame for the righteous returns (cf. a millennial expression of this great principle in <a ref='Isaiah 49:23'>Is 49:23</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 25:4–5'>25:4–5</a> The noun and verb metaphors speak of direction for life’s pathways (cf. the thrust of <a ref='Ps 1'>Ps 1</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 25:6–7'>25:6–7</a> <b>Remember … Do not remember … remember.</b> These are not concerns about God forgetting something, but the psalmist’s prayer reminds the readers about God’s gracious covenant promises and provisions, all of which are grounded upon His goodness (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 25:11'>11</a> , “Your name’s sake”). <a ref='Psalms 25:8–10'>25:8–10</a> More metaphors for life’s paths are used for the purpose of begging divine direction (cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 25:4–5'>4–5</a> ). The last line of v. <a ref='Psalms 25:10'>10</a> emphasizes covenant responsibilities on the human side (cf. the divine side in vv. <a ref='Psalms 25:6–7'>6–7</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 25:11'>25:11</a> <b>Pardon my iniquity, for it is great.</b> A maturing disciple develops an increasing sensitivity to sin which drives him more consistently to an appropriation of the promises of God’s pardoning grace (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 25:18'>18b</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 25:12'>25:12</a> <b>Who…?</b> This interrogative device (cf. <a ref='Ps 15'>Pss 15</a> , <a ref='Ps 24'>24</a> ) serves as an introductory vehicle to the hallmarks of genuine discipleship. <a ref='Psalms 25:14'>25:14</a> <b>The secret.</b> This could well be rendered the “counsel” or intimate personal communion (cf. <a ref='Job 29:4'>Job 29:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 55:14'>Ps 55:14</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 3:32'>Pr 3:32</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 25:15'>25:15</a> <b>net.</b> The snare of the hunter or fowler (cf. <a ref='Psalms 31:4'>Ps 31:4</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 25:16–21'>25:16–21</a> Ten rapid-fire prayer requests, asking for relief and encouragement, lie at the heart of these 6 verses. <a ref='Psalms 25:16'>25:16</a> <b>alone and afflicted.</b> These terms speak of isolation and humiliation. <a ref='Psalms 25:22'>25:22</a> The shift from the individual to the community is really not surprising, since the welfare of the theocratic people is inextricably connected to the covenant individual (cf. <a ref='Psalms 51:18–19'>Ps 51:18–19</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 26:1–12'>26:1–12</a> <a ref='Ps 26-27'>Psalms 26–27</a> , and <a ref='Ps 28'>28</a> mention the house, or sanctuary, of Yahweh because public worship is the central interest. The form of <a ref='Ps 26'>Ps 26</a> is mixed, i.e., containing elements of declarations of innocence, prayer, and confidence (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 26:1'>1</a> as a paradigm). Structurally, 4 intermingling prayers and proofs reveal the psalmist’s passion to worship Yahweh in spirit and in truth. I. His Situation ( <a ref='Psalms 26:1'>26:1</a> ) A. His Prayer for Justice ( <a ref='Psalms 26:1'>26:1a</a> ) B. His Proofs of Commitment ( <a ref='Psalms 26:1'>26:1b</a> ) II. His Transparency ( <a ref='Psalms 26:2–8'>26:2–8</a> ) A. His Prayer for Scrutiny ( <a ref='Psalms 26:2'>26:2</a> ) B. His Proofs of Loyalty ( <a ref='Psalms 26:3–8'>26:3–8</a> ) III. His Eschatological Outlook ( <a ref='Psalms 26:9–11'>26:9–11a</a> ) A. His Prayers for Final Favor ( <a ref='Psalms 26:9'>26:9</a> ) B. His Proofs of Measurable Difference ( <a ref='Psalms 26:10–11'>26:10–11a</a> ) IV. His Confidence ( <a ref='Psalms 26:11–12'>26:11b–12</a> ) A. His Prayers Show Confidence in the Person of God ( <a ref='Psalms 26:11'>26:11b</a> ) B. His Proofs Show Confidence in the Provision of God ( <a ref='Psalms 26:12'>26:12</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 26:1'>26:1</a> <b>Give justice to me.</b> Lit. “Judge me!” This refers to exoneration of some false accusations and/or charges under the protection of the covenant stipulations of the theocratic law (cf. <a ref='Psalms 7:8'>Pss 7:8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 35:24'>35:24</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 43:1'>43:1</a> ). <b>my integrity.</b> Again, this is not a claim to perfection, but of innocence, particularly as viewed within the context of ungrounded “legal” charges (cf. <a ref='Psalms 7:8'>Ps 7:8</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 10:9'>Pr 10:9</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 19:1'>19:1</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 20:7'>20:7</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 28:6'>28:6</a> ). <b>I will not waver.</b> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 18:36'>Pss 18:36</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 37:31'>37:31</a> ; contra. <a ref='Psalms 73:18–20'>Ps 73:18–20</a> . <a ref='Psalms 26:2'>26:2</a> <b>Test … try … Refine.</b> These 3 invitations to divine scrutiny are essentially synonymous ways of testing, refining, and purifying (cf. <a ref='Psalms 11:4–5'>Pss 11:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 12:6'>12:6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 17:3'>17:3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 66:10'>66:10</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 17:9–10'>Jer 17:9–10</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 26:4–5'>26:4–5</a> This language suggests that David is making a personal application of the characteristics of <a ref='Psalms 1:1'>Ps 1:1</a> . <a ref='Psalms 26:6'>26:6</a> Personal cleansing is a necessary prerequisite for acceptable worship (cf. <a ref='Psalms 24:3–4'>Ps 24:3–4</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 26:7'>26:7</a> <b>In order to proclaim.</b> The Hebrew text reads “to hear the sound of praise and to proclaim …,” a reference to the enjoyment of and participation in public worship. <a ref='Psalms 26:8'>26:8</a> <b>Your glory.</b> God’s “glory” most frequently refers to His self-manifestation, e.g., His attributes revealed and exhibited. <i>See note on <a ref='Leviticus 9:23'>Lv 9:23</a> .</i> <a ref='Psalms 26:9–11'>26:9–11</a> This is another sharp contrast between the injurious and the innocent. <a ref='Psalms 26:12'>26:12</a> <b>My foot stands.</b> Cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 26:1'>1</a> , “I will not waver.” <a ref='Psalms 27:1–14'>27:1–14</a> This psalm is characterized by strong contrasts such as lament and laud; persecution and praise; plus warfare and worship. In <a ref='Ps 27'>Ps 27</a> , the psalmist, in the presence of his Lord, engages in 3 conversations which help him balance the ups and downs of real life. I. He Converses with Himself about Privileges ( <a ref='Psalms 27:1–6'>27:1–6</a> ) II. He Converses with Yahweh about Problems ( <a ref='Psalms 27:7–12'>27:7–12</a> ) III. He Converses with Himself about Perseverance ( <a ref='Psalms 27:13–14'>27:13–14</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 27:1'>27:1</a> <b>light.</b> This important biblical word picture with exclusively positive connotations pictures the light of redemption in contrast to the darkness of condemnation (cf. <a ref='Psalms 18:28'>Pss 18:28</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 36:9'>36:9</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 43:3'>43:3</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:1'>Is 60:1</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 60:19–20'>19–20</a> ; <a ref='Micah 7:8'>Mic 7:8</a> ; <a ref='John 8:12'>Jn 8:12</a> ; <a ref='John 12:46'>12:46</a> ; <a ref='1 John 1:5'>1Jn 1:5</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 27:2'>27:2</a> <b>to devour my flesh.</b> An allusion to the psalmist’s enemies being like vicious beasts (cf. <a ref='Psalms 7:2'>Pss 7:2</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 14:4'>14:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 17:12'>17:12</a> ; <a ref='Job 19:22'>Job 19:22</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 30:16'>Jer 30:16</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 50:7'>50:7</a> ). This wording was also employed to describe slander and defamation (cf. a close Aramaic parallel in <a ref='Daniel 3:8'>Da 3:8</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 6:24'>6:24</a> ). <b>they stumbled and fell.</b> This doublet conveys thorough defeat (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 3:8'>Is 3:8</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 8:15'>8:15</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 31:3'>31:3</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 46:6'>Jer 46:6</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 27:4'>27:4</a> <b>One thing.</b> The primary issue in David’s life was to live in God’s presence and by His purpose (cf. <a ref='Psalms 15:1'>Pss 15:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 23:6'>23:6</a> ; cf. Paul’s “one thing” in <a ref='Philippians 3:13'>Php 3:13</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 27:5'>27:5</a> <b>His shelter.</b> David portrays the privileges of divine protection as being hidden in God’s “booth” or “shelter,” a term in parallelism with “tabernacle” or “tent.” <a ref='Psalms 27:8–9'>27:8–9</a> <b>Seek My face … Your face … Your face.</b> God’s “face” indicates His personal presence or simply His being ( <a ref='Psalms 24:6'>Pss 24:6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 105:4'>105:4</a> ); and seeking His face is a primary characteristic of true believers who desire fellowship with God (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:29'>Dt 4:29</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 11:16'>2Chr 11:16</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:4'>20:4</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 40:16'>Ps 40:16</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 50:4'>Jer 50:4</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 3:5'>Hos 3:5</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 8:22'>Zec 8:22</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 27:10'>27:10</a> Even though those nearest and dearest to David might abandon him, his Lord would always be concerned about and care for him (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:6'>Dt 31:6</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 31:8'>8</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 49:14–15'>Is 49:14–15</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 13:5'>Heb 13:5</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 27:14'>27:14</a> <b>Hope … Hope.</b> This particular word for waiting connotes either a tense or eager and patient anticipation of Yahweh (cf. <a ref='Psalms 37:34'>Pss 37:34</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 40:1'>40:1</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 28:1–9'>28:1–9</a> We encounter a radical shift from lamentation and prayer to thanksgiving. The psalmist, without regard for his unchanged circumstances, shows confidence in crisis. David, moving through two cycles of crisis and confidence, magnifies the justice of God. I. First Cycle: Individual in Outlook, and Terminates in Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 28:1–7'>28:1–7</a> ) A. His Personal Crisis ( <a ref='Psalms 28:1–5'>28:1–5b</a> ) B. His Personal Confidence ( <a ref='Psalms 28:5–7'>28:5c–7</a> ) II. Second Cycle: Corporate in Outlook, and Terminates in Prayer ( <a ref='Psalms 28:8–9'>28:8–9</a> ) A. His Reassurance in the Light of Corporate Confidence ( <a ref='Psalms 28:8'>28:8</a> ) B. His Request in the Face of Corporate Crisis ( <a ref='Psalms 28:9'>28:9</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 28:1'>28:1</a> <b>silent … hesitant.</b> On the striking picture of God being deaf and dumb regarding his situation, cf. <a ref='Psalms 35:22'>Pss 35:22</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 83:1'>83:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 109:1'>109:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 57:11'>Is 57:11</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 64:12'>64:12</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 65:6'>65:6</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 1:13'>Hab 1:13</a> . <a ref='Psalms 28:2'>28:2</a> <b>When I lift up my hands.</b> On this symbolic “posture” representing the heart’s attitude in dependent prayer, see <a ref='Exodus 9:29'>Ex 9:29</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 17:11–12'>17:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 63:4'>Ps 63:4</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 2:8'>1Ti 2:8</a> . <a ref='Psalms 28:3–5'>28:3–5</a> The iniquities of the psalmist’s (really God’s) enemies bring forth sharp imprecations. <a ref='Psalms 28:6'>28:6</a> <b>Because He has heard the voice of my supplications.</b> Contrast vv. <a ref='Psalms 28:1–2'>1–2</a> . Through faith, the psalmist will live his life as though God has already intervened. <a ref='Psalms 28:8'>28:8</a> <b>His anointed.</b> This is most likely a corporate reference to the people of God being anointed, not to an individual (cf. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:13'>Hab 3:13</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 28:9'>28:9</a> <b>Your inheritance.</b> God amazingly considers His people a most precious possession (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:6–16'>Dt 7:6–16</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 9:29'>9:29</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 10:1'>1Sa 10:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 33:12'>Pss 33:12</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 94:5'>94:5</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:18'>Eph 1:18</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 29:1–11'>29:1–11</a> This psalm has all the earmarks of the earliest Hebrew poetry (cf. <a ref='Ex 15'>Ex 15</a> ; <a ref='Jdg 5'>Jdg 5</a> ). As to its general form, it is a hymn. Many of its images appear in parallel literature, especially in referencing pagan gods by various forces of nature. However, Yahweh is the unique Creator and supreme Sovereign over all these phenomena. He alone is “the God of gods” ( <a ref='Daniel 11:36'>Da 11:36</a> ). In view of these realities, 3 representative realms of the supremacy of God bring forth praise to Yahweh (Jehovah) alone. I. Yahweh’s Supremacy over Heavenly Beings ( <a ref='Psalms 29:1–2'>29:1–2</a> ) II. Yahweh’s Supremacy over the “Forces of Nature” ( <a ref='Psalms 29:3–9'>29:3–9</a> ) III. Yahweh’s Supremacy over Humanity ( <a ref='Psalms 29:10–11'>29:10–11</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 29:1'>29:1</a> <b>sons of the mighty.</b> Lit “sons of God” (cf. <a ref='Psalms 89:6'>Ps 89:6</a> in its context of vv. <a ref='Psalms 29:5–10'>5–10</a> ; cf. the plural form of “gods” in <a ref='Exodus 15:11'>Ex 15:11</a> ). The reference here in <a ref='Ps 29'>Ps 29</a> is most likely to Yahweh’s mighty angels. <a ref='Psalms 29:3–9'>29:3–9</a> This is an awesome theophany, depicting dramatic movements in the powerful manifestations of the Lord God, which function to establish His supremacy as the only true God in comparison with any of the so-called gods of Israel’s pagan neighbors. <a ref='Psalms 29:3'>29:3</a> <b>The voice of Yahweh.</b> His voice is frequently associated with the thunder (cf., e.g., <a ref='1 Samuel 7:10'>1Sa 7:10</a> ; <a ref='Job 37:4–5'>Job 37:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 18:13'>Ps 18:13</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 30:30–31'>Is 30:30–31</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 29:5'>29:5</a> <b>the cedars … the cedars of Lebanon.</b> These are the grandest of forest trees, and those of Lebanon were especially impressive. <a ref='Psalms 29:6'>29:6</a> <b>Sirion.</b> This is the Phoenician name for Mt. Hermon to the north of Dan (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 3:9'>Dt 3:9</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 29:8'>29:8</a> <b>the wilderness of Kadesh.</b> Kadesh-barnea is in the southern desert country. For its importance in the history of Israel, <i>see note on <a ref='Numbers 20:1'>Nu 20:1</a></i> . <a ref='Psalms 29:10'>29:10</a> <b>the flood.</b> This refers to the universal flood of <a ref='Ge 6-8'>Ge 6–8</a> (esp., <a ref='Genesis 7:17'>Ge 7:17</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 30:1–12'>30:1–12</a> A mixture of forms characterize <a ref='Ps 30'>Ps 30</a> . David speaks out of a cycle of life (i.e., lamentation and laud), especially moving through prayer to praise. In spite of great variety, the psalm is bonded together by praise emphases (cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 30:4'>4</a> , <a ref='Psalms 30:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Psalms 30:12'>12</a> ). The psalmist’s beginning and ending pledges to praise provide structure for his prayers and testimonies. I. His Beginning Pledge of Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 30:1'>30:1a</a> ) II. His Look Back upon Historic Prayers and Testimonies ( <a ref='Psalms 30:1–9'>30:1b–9</a> ) A. His Individual Remembrance ( <a ref='Psalms 30:1–3'>30:1b–3</a> ) B. His Public Reminders ( <a ref='Psalms 30:4–5'>30:4–5</a> ) C. His Individual Reflections ( <a ref='Psalms 30:6–9'>30:6–9</a> ) III. His Look Ahead to Continuing Prayers and Testimonies ( <a ref='Psalms 30:10–12'>30:10–12a</a> ) IV. His Concluding Pledge of Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 30:12'>30:12b</a> ) <a ref='Ps 30'>30:Title</a> The first and last parts of this title, i.e., “A Psalm … of David,” are common notations in the superscriptions of many psalms. However, the middle words, “a Song at the Dedication of the House,” were probably added later, although they could have referenced David’s temporary tent for the ark erected on Mt. Zion ( <a ref='2 Samuel 6:17'>2Sa 6:17</a> ) or his own house ( <a ref='2 Samuel 5:11–12'>2Sa 5:11–12</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 30:2–3'>30:2–3</a> <b>You healed me.</b> God alone is the unique healer (cf. <a ref='Exodus 15:26'>Ex 15:26</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:39'>Dt 32:39</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 107:20'>Ps 107:20</a> ). David is extolling God for bringing him back from a near-death experience. <a ref='Psalms 30:5'>30:5</a> This stark contrast constitutes one of the most worshipful testimonies from the Scriptures (cf. the principle in <a ref='Isaiah 54:7–8'>Is 54:7–8</a> ; <a ref='John 16:20–22'>Jn 16:20–22</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:17'>2Co 4:17</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 30:6'>30:6</a> David recalls his previous independent attitude and arrogant talk. God had warned the nation and its leaders about such sinfully myopic outlooks (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 8:11–20'>Dt 8:11–20</a> ; note sample failures in <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:15'>Dt 32:15</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 32:25'>2Chr 32:25</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 22:21'>Jer 22:21</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 13:6'>Hos 13:6</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 4:28–37'>Da 4:28–37</a> ). By the grace of God, David woke up to the fact that he was acting like his arrogant adversaries (cf. <a ref='Psalms 10:6'>Ps 10:6</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 30:8–10'>30:8–10</a> A familiar argument for preservation of life (cf. <a ref='Psalms 6:5'>Pss 6:5</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 28:1'>28:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 88:10–12'>88:10–12</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 115:17'>115:17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 38:18–19'>Is 38:18–19</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 30:12'>30:12</a> my <b>glory.</b> Now with renewed perspective (contra. v. <a ref='Psalms 30:6'>6</a> ), he recognizes that all he is and has is due to God’s unmerited grace (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 30:7'>7a</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 31:1–24'>31:1–24</a> This psalm contains more of David’s problems, prayers, and praises. David will again walk a road that takes him from anguish to assurance. Within the two settings of <a ref='Ps 31'>Ps 31</a> , the psalmist’s testimonies passionately celebrate the sufficiencies of God. I. The Originally Private Setting ( <a ref='Psalms 31:1–18'>31:1–18</a> ) A. His Testimony about Security and Salvation ( <a ref='Psalms 31:1–5'>31:1–5</a> ) B. His Testimony about Discernment and Deliverance ( <a ref='Psalms 31:6–8'>31:6–8</a> ) C. His Testimony about Reproach and Relief ( <a ref='Psalms 31:9–18'>31:9–18</a> ) II. The Ultimately Public Setting ( <a ref='Psalms 31:19–24'>31:19–24</a> ) A. His Testimonies and Divine Exaltation ( <a ref='Psalms 31:19–22'>31:19–22</a> ) B. His Testimonies and Human Exhortation ( <a ref='Psalms 31:23–24'>31:23–24</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 31:2'>31:2</a> <b>Incline Your ear to me.</b> This is a bold pay-attention-to-my-prayer demand (cf. <a ref='Psalms 102:2'>Ps 102:2</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 31:3'>31:3</a> The language resembles that of <a ref='Psalms 23:1–3'>Ps 23:1–3</a> , except it now comes packaged in prayer requests. <a ref='Psalms 31:5'>31:5</a> <b>Into Your hand.</b> This is applied to both the lesser David and the Greater David ( <a ref='Luke 23:46'>Lk 23:46</a> ); here it involves the common denominator of trust. This is a metaphor depicting God’s power and control (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 31:15'>15a</a> ; contra. vv. <a ref='Psalms 31:8'>8</a> , <a ref='Psalms 31:15'>15b</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 31:6'>31:6</a> <b>I hate.</b> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 26:5'>Ps 26:5</a> on the proper basis for such hatred (cf. <a ref='Psalms 139:21'>Ps 139:21</a> ). <b>worthless idols.</b> This is a common designation for false gods (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:21'>Dt 32:21</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 16:13'>1Ki 16:13</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 10:15'>Jer 10:15</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 14:22'>14:22</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 16:19'>16:19</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 18:15'>18:15</a> ; <a ref='Jonah 2:8'>Jon 2:8</a> ). On the “idiocy” of idolatry, see <a ref='Habakkuk 2:18–20'>Hab 2:18–20</a> . <a ref='Psalms 31:9–10'>31:9–10</a> These terms quite frequently are employed metaphysically to convey the nonphysical impact of trials and tribulations. <a ref='Psalms 31:11'>31:11</a> He was a reproach to adversaries and personal acquaintances alike, a very painful alienation (cf. <a ref='Psalms 88:8'>Ps 88:8</a> , <a ref='Psalms 88:18'>18</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 31:13'>31:13</a> <b>Terror is on every side.</b> (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 6:25'>Jer 6:25</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 20:3'>20:3</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 20:10'>10</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 46:5'>46:5</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 49:29'>49:29</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 2:22'>Lam 2:22</a> ). <b>They schemed.</b> On such wicked plotting, cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 11:19'>Jer 11:19</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 18:23'>18:23</a> . <a ref='Psalms 31:16'>31:16</a> This is a request for a personal application of the blessing of <a ref='Numbers 6:25'>Nu 6:25</a> (cf. <a ref='Psalms 4:6'>Pss 4:6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 67:1'>67:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 80:3'>80:3</a> , <a ref='Psalms 80:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Psalms 80:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 119:135'>119:135</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 31:17'>31:17</a> On their shame but not his, cf. <a ref='Psalms 25:2–3'>Ps 25:2–3</a> , <a ref='Psalms 25:20'>20</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 17:18'>Jer 17:18</a> . <a ref='Psalms 31:18'>31:18</a> , <a ref='Psalms 31:20'>20</a> His enemies exhibit signs of “mouth” disease. <a ref='Psalms 31:19'>31:19</a> <b>Your goodness.</b> As in the case of His other attributes, God being perfectly good is the ground for His doing good things (cf. <a ref='Psalms 119:68'>Ps 119:68</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 31:23'>31:23</a> <b>love Yahweh.</b> Biblical love includes an attitudinal response and demonstrated obedience (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:4–5'>Dt 6:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:12'>10:12</a> ; <a ref='John 14:15'>Jn 14:15</a> , <a ref='John 14:21'>21</a> ; <a ref='John 15:10'>15:10</a> ; <a ref='2 John 1:6'>2Jn 6</a> ). The assurance of both reward and retribution is a biblical maxim (e.g., <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:9–10'>Dt 7:9–10</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 31:24'>31:24</a> <b>Be strong … take courage.</b> A sing. form of this pl. imperative was addressed to Joshua in <a ref='Joshua 1:7'>1:7</a> . It is used nearly 20 times in the OT, particularly in anticipation of battle. <a ref='Psalms 32:1–11'>32:1–11</a> This psalm has been classified by the early church as one of 7 penitential psalms (cf. <a ref='Ps 6'>6</a> ; <a ref='Ps 38'>38</a> ; <a ref='Ps 51'>51</a> ; <a ref='Ps 102'>102</a> ; <a ref='Ps 130'>130</a> ; <a ref='Ps 143'>143</a> ). Among these, <a ref='Ps 32'>Pss 32</a> and <a ref='Ps 51'>51</a> stand out as confessional giants. As historically related to the life of David and especially in connection with the Bathsheba episode (cf. <a ref='2Sa 11-12'>2Sa 11–12</a> ), <a ref='Ps 51'>Ps 51</a> would have preceded <a ref='Ps 32'>Ps 32</a> . The overall thrust, intent, and development of <a ref='Ps 32'>Ps 32</a> may be summarized as follows: Life’s most important lessons about sin, confession, and forgiveness are skillfully shared by David through two avenues of approach. I. First Avenue: Remembering These Lessons ( <a ref='Psalms 32:1–5'>32:1–5</a> ) A. Lessons about Results ( <a ref='Psalms 32:1–2'>32:1–2</a> ) B. Lessons about Resistance ( <a ref='Psalms 32:3–4'>32:3–4</a> ) C. Lessons about Responses ( <a ref='Psalms 32:5'>32:5</a> ) II. Second Avenue: Relaying These Lessons ( <a ref='Psalms 32:6–11'>32:6–11</a> ) A. Lessons about Responses ( <a ref='Psalms 32:6–7'>32:6–7</a> ) B. Lessons about Resistance ( <a ref='Psalms 32:8–9'>32:8–9</a> ) C. Lessons about Results ( <a ref='Psalms 32:10–11'>32:10–11</a> ) <a ref='Ps 32'>32:Title</a> “A Maskil” in the heading introduces a new technical term. It could indicate that <a ref='Ps 32'>Ps 32</a> was a “ <i>contemplative</i> poem,” or a “psalm of <i>understanding</i> ,” or a “ <i>skillful</i> psalm.” <a ref='Psalms 32:1–2'>32:1–2</a> <b>transgression … sin … account.</b> Three key OT words for sin occur, viewing it respectively as rebellion, failure, and perversion. <a ref='Psalms 32:3–4'>32:3–4</a> These are vivid descriptions of the physical effects of his impenitent state. <a ref='Psalms 32:5'>32:5</a> David picks up the key terms that he had used to describe sin in vv. <a ref='Psalms 32:1–2'>1–2</a> , but now, in a context of personal confession, he identifies those heinous affronts to the person of God as his own. On the priority of confession, cf. <a ref='Proverbs 28:13'>Pr 28:13</a> ; <a ref='1 John 1:8–10'>1Jn 1:8–10</a> . <a ref='Psalms 32:6'>32:6</a> David slips right back into teaching mode in this verse, emphasizing that every person who knows the grace of God should not presume upon that grace by putting off confession. <a ref='Psalms 32:8'>32:8</a> <b>give … teach … counsel.</b> This terminology applies to biblical wisdom. <a ref='Psalms 32:9'>32:9</a> <b>horse … mule.</b> I.e., Don’t be stubborn. Such animals are used as pointed illustrations of this sin (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 26:3'>Pr 26:3</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 1:3'>Is 1:3</a> ; <a ref='James 3:3'>Jas 3:3</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 33:1–22'>33:1–22</a> This psalm is a general hymn of praise. Its two primary themes are: 1) Yahweh is the Lord of nature, and 2) He is Lord of history. In biblical thought, these realms are always related; the Creator sovereignly rules over His total creation, over all creatures throughout time. I. A Praise Prelude ( <a ref='Psalms 33:1–3'>33:1–3</a> ) II. The Rationale for Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 33:4–5'>33:4–5</a> ) A. Yahweh’s Sovereign Power in Natural History ( <a ref='Psalms 33:4'>33:4</a> ) B. Yahweh’s Sovereign Providence over Human History ( <a ref='Psalms 33:5'>33:5</a> ) III. The Response of Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 33:6–19'>33:6–19</a> ) A. The Creator’s Sovereign Power ( <a ref='Psalms 33:6–9'>33:6–9</a> ) B. The Creator’s Sovereign Providence ( <a ref='Psalms 33:10–19'>33:10–19</a> ) IV. A Prayer Finale ( <a ref='Psalms 33:20–22'>33:20–22</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 33:1'>33:1</a> <b>becoming.</b> This means that praise to Him is proper, suitable, and fitting. On the propriety of praise, cf. <a ref='Psalms 147:1'>Ps 147:1</a> . <a ref='Psalms 33:3'>33:3</a> <b>a new song.</b> I.e., a new occasion and impulse for expressing fresh praise to God (cf. <a ref='Psalms 96:1'>Pss 96:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 98:1'>98:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 149:1'>149:1</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 33:6'>33:6</a> , <a ref='Psalms 33:9'>9</a> God’s utterances created a universe out of nothing (cf. “God said” in <a ref='Genesis 1:3'>Ge 1:3</a> , <a ref='Genesis 1:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Genesis 1:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Genesis 1:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Genesis 1:14'>14</a> , <a ref='Genesis 1:20'>20</a> , <a ref='Genesis 1:24'>24</a> , <a ref='Genesis 1:26'>26</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 33:6'>33:6</a> <b>host.</b> This designation refers to stellar and planetary bodies (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 40:26'>Is 40:26</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 45:12'>45:12</a> ) and/or heaven’s complement of angels (cf. <a ref='Psalms 103:20–22'>Ps 103:20–22</a> ). The former emphasis is more prominent in the immediate context. <a ref='Psalms 33:7'>33:7</a> <b>He lays up.</b> On this picturesque language of God’s “heaping up” waters as a “pile” of dirt or sand, cf. <a ref='Exodus 15:8'>Ex 15:8</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 3:13–16'>Jos 3:13–16</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 78:13'>Ps 78:13</a> . <a ref='Psalms 33:10–11'>33:10–11</a> A sharp contrast is drawn between mankind’s shaky plans and Yahweh’s sovereign plans. <a ref='Psalms 33:15'>33:15</a> <b>He who forms the hearts.</b> This is the potter’s word (cf. <a ref='Genesis 2:7'>Ge 2:7</a> ); for the significance of this statement, see <a ref='Isaiah 29:15–16'>Is 29:15–16</a> . <a ref='Psalms 33:16–19'>33:16–19</a> On the teaching of these verses, cf. the maxim of <a ref='Zechariah 4:6'>Zec 4:6</a> . <a ref='Psalms 34:1–22'>34:1–22</a> This acrostic psalm is quite similar to <a ref='Ps 25'>Ps 25</a> , not just in form, but also in major themes (e.g., the emphasis on redemption that brings each psalm to a close in <a ref='Psalms 25:22'>25:22</a> and <a ref='Psalms 34:22'>34:22</a> ). Individual and corporate applications of Yahweh’s deliverance are found throughout. This psalm unfolds with a praise mode followed by teaching. I. Personal Testimony ( <a ref='Psalms 34:1–10'>34:1–10</a> ) II. Personal Teaching ( <a ref='Psalms 34:11–22'>34:11–22</a> ) <a ref='Ps 34'>34:Title</a> The historical occasion to which this heading alludes is found in <a ref='1 Samuel 21:10–15'>1Sa 21:10–15</a> ; however, there is nothing obvious in the context of <a ref='Ps 34'>Ps 34</a> to make such a specific connection. Abimelech, like Pharaoh, was a dynastic designation, not a proper name. <a ref='Psalms 34:1–3'>34:1–3</a> This is one of the greatest invitations in the Psalms to all the people to join together in praise. <a ref='Psalms 34:2'>34:2</a> This is proper boasting because of the only proper object, God Himself (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 9:23–24'>Jer 9:23–24</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 34:7'>34:7</a> <b>The angel of Yahweh.</b> A special manifestation of Yahweh Himself at strategic historical junctures (cf. <a ref='Genesis 16:7'>Ge 16:7ff.</a> ; <a ref='Ge 18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Ge 19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 31:11'>31:11ff.</a> ; <a ref='Jos 5'>Jos 5</a> ; <a ref='Jdg 6'>Jdg 6</a> ; <a ref='Jdg 13'>13</a> ). A strong case can be made that these were pre-incarnate appearances of the Lord Jesus Christ. <i>See note on <a ref='Exodus 3:2'>Ex 3:2</a> .</i> <a ref='Psalms 34:11'>34:11</a> This solicitation to wisdom compares with <a ref='Pr 1-9'>Pr 1–9</a> . <a ref='Psalms 34:12–14'>34:12–14</a> This introduces some crucial character qualities of God’s true people; cf. <a ref='Psalms 15:1–5'>Ps 15:1–5</a> . <a ref='Psalms 34:14'>34:14</a> The pathway theme of <a ref='Ps 1'>Ps 1</a> ; here the emphasis is on leaving the evil and doing good (cf. <a ref='Job 28:28'>Job 28:28</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 3:7'>Pr 3:7</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 16:6'>16:6</a> , <a ref='Proverbs 16:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 1:16–17'>Is 1:16–17</a> ; etc.). <a ref='Psalms 34:18'>34:18</a> <b>brokenhearted … crushed in spirit.</b> These are graphic idioms that describe dependent disciples (cf. <a ref='Psalms 51:17'>Pss 51:17</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 147:3'>147:3</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 57:15'>Is 57:15</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 61:1'>61:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 66:2'>66:2</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 5:3'>Mt 5:3</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 34:19–22'>34:19–22</a> The side-by-side realities of human persecution and divine preservation once again vividly depict real life in the real world. <a ref='Psalms 35:1–28'>35:1–28</a> <a ref='Ps 35'>Psalm 35</a> , as to its form, is an individual lament. Its context of literal and legal warfare suggests a scenario of the theocratic king being accused, and about to be attacked, by a foreign power with whom he had previously entered into a covenant. David presents his “case” before the Divine Judge, moving from a complaint about the situation, to prayer about the situation, and finally, when Yahweh would justly respond to the situation, praise for His righteous intervention. So, 3 cycles of exasperation and expectation in <a ref='Ps 35'>Ps 35</a> convey the psalmist’s prayers about his opponents to God. I. First Cycle: The Attacks He Was Experiencing ( <a ref='Psalms 35:1–10'>35:1–10</a> ) II. Second Cycle: The Perjury He Was Experiencing ( <a ref='Psalms 35:11–18'>35:11–18</a> ) A. He Prays that God Would Examine the Evidence ( <a ref='Psalms 35:11–16'>35:11–16</a> ) B. He Prays that God Would Act without Delay ( <a ref='Psalms 35:17'>35:17</a> ) C. He Pledges Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 35:18'>35:18</a> ) III. Third Cycle: The Mockery He Was Anticipating ( <a ref='Psalms 35:19–28'>35:19–28</a> ) A. He Prays for Judgment concerning Them ( <a ref='Psalms 35:19–21'>35:19–21</a> ) B. He Prays for Justice concerning Himself ( <a ref='Psalms 35:22–26'>35:22–26</a> ) C. He Pledges Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 35:27–28'>35:27–28</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 35:1'>35:1</a> <b>Contend … Fight.</b> The first bold prayer solicits the legal advocacy of God (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 25:8–9'>Pr 25:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 3:13'>Is 3:13</a> ), while the second asks the Divine Warrior to fight his battles for him (e.g., <a ref='Exodus 15:3'>Ex 15:3</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:41'>Dt 32:41ff.</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 35:3'>35:3</a> <b>Say to my soul, “I am your salvation.”</b> David is longing for reassurance (cf. <a ref='Psalms 3:8'>Ps 3:8a</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 35:4–8'>35:4–8</a> Cf. the imprecations of <a ref='Ps 7'>Pss 7</a> , <a ref='Ps 69'>69</a> , <a ref='Ps 109'>109</a> . <a ref='Psalms 35:7'>35:7</a> <b>without cause … Without cause.</b> This adds to his defense; all their attacks, from a covenant or legal standpoint, have been unjustified. <a ref='Psalms 35:10'>35:10</a> <b>Yahweh, who is like You.</b> This had become a canonized expression of awe at the uniqueness of Israel’s great God (cf. <a ref='Exodus 15:11'>Ex 15:11</a> ; <a ref='Micah 7:18'>Mic 7:18</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 35:11–14'>35:11–14</a> A strong contrast is drawn between the psalmist’s attitude about the covenant agreement and that of his treaty partner. <a ref='Psalms 35:16'>35:16</a> On the painful maimings of mockery, cf. <a ref='Job 16:9'>Job 16:9</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 37:12'>Pss 37:12</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 112:10'>112:10</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 2:16'>Lam 2:16</a> . <a ref='Psalms 35:17'>35:17</a> <b>how long…?</b> On laments, cf. <a ref='Psalms 13:1'>Ps 13:1</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 1:2'>Hab 1:2</a> . <a ref='Psalms 35:19'>35:19</a> <b>wrongfully.</b> Cf. “without cause” twice in v. <a ref='Psalms 35:7'>7</a> . <a ref='Psalms 35:21'>35:21</a> <b>Aha, aha.</b> This taunting chorus will return in v. <a ref='Psalms 35:25'>25</a> . <a ref='Psalms 35:21–22'>35:21–22</a> <b>our eyes have seen it! You have seen it, O Yahweh.</b> What David’s enemy allegedly saw, Yahweh has seen perfectly. David knew that his God would vindicate him based upon the true evidence, all in his favor. <a ref='Psalms 35:23'>35:23</a> <b>to my cause.</b> He brings back the advocacy theme of v. <a ref='Psalms 35:1'>1</a> . <a ref='Psalms 35:27'>35:27</a> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 40:16'>Ps 40:16</a> . <b>His slave.</b> Besides being a polite third-person reference to the psalmist, the terminology was also used of an OT disciple regarding himself as bound to Yahweh. <a ref='Psalms 36:1–12'>36:1–12</a> At least 3 themes may be detected in this psalm: 1) wisdom, vv. <a ref='Psalms 36:1–4'>1–4</a> ; 2) praise, vv. <a ref='Psalms 36:5–9'>5–9</a> ; and 3) prayer, vv. <a ref='Psalms 36:10–12'>10–12</a> . <a ref='Ps 36'>Psalm 36</a> resembles <a ref='Ps 14'>Ps 14</a> in its description of human depravity; it also brings to mind David’s personal confession found in <a ref='Ps 32'>Ps 32</a> . Paul used <a ref='Psalms 36:1'>Ps 36:1</a> to summarize his list of 14 indictments against the whole race in <a ref='Romans 3:10–18'>Ro 3:10–18</a> . As to its overall structure, David’s two different moods in <a ref='Ps 36'>Ps 36</a> exemplify his continuing quest for balance concerning the realities of human wickedness and divine benevolence. I. Mood of Deliberation ( <a ref='Psalms 36:1–9'>36:1–9</a> ) A. His Deliberations on Human Infidelity ( <a ref='Psalms 36:1–4'>36:1–4</a> ) B. His Deliberations on Divine Fidelity ( <a ref='Psalms 36:5–9'>36:5–9</a> ) II. Mood of Dependence ( <a ref='Psalms 36:10–12'>36:10–12</a> ) A. Implemented through Prayer ( <a ref='Psalms 36:10–11'>36:10–11</a> ) B. Intimated through Perspective ( <a ref='Psalms 36:12'>36:12</a> ) <a ref='Ps 36'>36:Title</a> The term “servant,” found in <a ref='Psalms 35:27'>Ps 35:27</a> , appears in this title. It carries an association with covenant relationship emphasizing submission to and service for God. For its application to David within the texts of Psalms, cf. <a ref='Psalms 78:70'>78:70</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:3'>89:3</a> . <a ref='Psalms 36:1'>36:1</a> <b>no dread.</b> This is the opposite of the attitude which characterizes true disciples. In addition to dread, the word here can also mean “terror” (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 2:25'>Dt 2:25</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 119:120'>Ps 119:120</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 2:10'>Is 2:10</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 2:19'>19</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 2:21'>21</a> ; etc.). <a ref='Psalms 36:2'>36:2</a> I.e., he flatters himself so much that he is unable to understand enough to hate his own iniquity. <a ref='Psalms 36:3–4'>36:3–4</a> Although Paul cites only <a ref='Psalms 36:1'>Ps 36:1b</a> in <a ref='Ro 3'>Ro 3</a> , the same categories of characteristic sinfulness also show up in that context; cf. character: <a ref='Psalms 36:2'>Ps 36:2</a> with <a ref='Romans 3:10–12'>Ro 3:10–12</a> ; communications: <a ref='Psalms 36:3'>Ps 36:3a</a> with <a ref='Romans 3:13–14'>Ro 3:13–14</a> ; and conduct: <a ref='Psalms 36:3–4'>Ps 36:3b–4</a> with <a ref='Romans 3:15–17'>Ro 3:15–17</a> . <a ref='Psalms 36:5–6'>36:5–6</a> These attributes of God are immeasurable. <a ref='Psalms 36:7'>36:7</a> <b>the shadow of Your wings.</b> Although some would take this as referring to wings of the cherubim over the ark, it is probably more generally a reference to the protective care of a parent bird for its young ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:11'>Dt 32:11</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 17:8'>Pss 17:8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 91:4'>91:4</a> ; <a ref='Ruth 2:12'>Ru 2:12</a> ; cf. Jesus’ allusion to the word picture in <a ref='Matthew 23:37'>Mt 23:37</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 36:9'>36:9</a> <b>In Your light we see light.</b> It is likely that this phraseology bears both literal and figurative significance, i.e., God is the source of physical life and also of spiritual life. Yahweh is the Source and Sustainer of all light and life. <a ref='Psalms 36:11'>36:11</a> <b>the foot of pride.</b> This is likely military imagery referring to the practice of a victorious king-general symbolically placing his foot upon the neck of a prostrated, defeated king-general. <a ref='Psalms 36:12'>36:12</a> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 14:5'>Pss 14:5a</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 18:38'>18:38</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 24:16'>Pr 24:16</a> . <a ref='Psalms 37:1–40'>37:1–40</a> <a ref='Ps 37'>Psalm 37</a> , an irregular acrostic, is a wisdom poem addressed to man, not God. Verses <a ref='Psalms 37:12–24'>12–24</a> sound very much like the maxims of Proverbs. The covenant promises of the “land” for Israel are prominent in its verses (cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 37:3'>3</a> , <a ref='Psalms 37:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Psalms 37:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Psalms 37:22'>22</a> , <a ref='Psalms 37:29'>29</a> , <a ref='Psalms 37:34'>34</a> ). Its basic theme deals with the age-old question “Why do the ungodly prosper while the godly painfully struggle through life?” An intricate arrangement puts forth David’s answer. In <a ref='Ps 37'>Ps 37</a> , David mixes and matches 6 thoughts in order to advance his major message on the eventual arrival of divine justice. I. An Introductory Overview ( <a ref='Psalms 37:1–2'>37:1–2</a> ) II. An Initial Expansion ( <a ref='Psalms 37:3–11'>37:3–11</a> ) III. Some Proverbial Perspectives ( <a ref='Psalms 37:12–24'>37:12–24</a> ) IV. An Initial Testimony ( <a ref='Psalms 37:25–26'>37:25–26</a> ) V. A Final Expansion (cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 37:3–11'>3–11</a> ) ( <a ref='Psalms 37:27–34'>37:27–34</a> ) VI. A Final Testimony (cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 37:25–26'>25–26</a> ) ( <a ref='Psalms 37:35–40'>37:35–40</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 37:2'>37:2</a> Here-today-gone-tomorrow illustrations about the wicked characterize this psalm. On this theme, cf. <a ref='Job 14:1–2'>Job 14:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 90:5–6'>Pss 90:5–6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 103:15–16'>103:15–16</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 40:6–8'>Is 40:6–8</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 6:30'>Mt 6:30</a> ; <a ref='James 1:10–11'>Jas 1:10–11</a> ; <a ref='1 John 2:17'>1Jn 2:17</a> . <a ref='Psalms 37:7–8'>37:7–8</a> The message of “Relax! Don’t react!” returns (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 37:1'>1</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 37:10'>37:10</a> <b>Yet a little while.</b> Cf. similar terminology in <a ref='Jeremiah 51:33'>Jer 51:33</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 1:4'>Hos 1:4</a> . Yahweh’s intervention is imminent. <a ref='Psalms 37:17'>37:17</a> <b>the arms of the wicked will be broken.</b> Their members will be shattered for grabbing and getting wealth (v. <a ref='Psalms 37:16'>16b</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Job 38:15'>Job 38:15</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 10:15'>Ps 10:15</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 48:25'>Jer 48:25</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 30:21'>Eze 30:21</a> . <a ref='Psalms 37:18'>37:18</a> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 1:6'>Ps 1:6</a> . <a ref='Psalms 37:21'>37:21</a> The OT contains both precepts and proverbs about borrowing and lending; cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 15:6'>Dt 15:6</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:12'>28:12</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:44'>44</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 112:1–6'>Ps 112:1–6</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 22:7'>Pr 22:7</a> . <a ref='Psalms 37:24'>37:24</a> For corroborations of such divine comfort, cf. <a ref='Psalms 145:14'>Ps 145:14</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 24:16'>Pr 24:16</a> ; <a ref='Micah 7:8'>Mic 7:8</a> . <a ref='Psalms 37:31'>37:31</a> <b>The law of his God is in his heart.</b> On God’s internalized instruction, cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:6'>Dt 6:6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 40:8'>Pss 40:8</a> ; <a ref='Ps 119'>119</a> (throughout); <a ref='Jeremiah 31:33'>Jer 31:33</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 51:7'>Is 51:7</a> . <a ref='Psalms 37:38'>37:38</a> <b>cut off.</b> On this truth of judgment, cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 37:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Psalms 37:22'>22</a> , <a ref='Psalms 37:28'>28</a> , <a ref='Psalms 37:34'>34</a> , and <a ref='Psalms 109:13'>Ps 109:13</a> . For a positive presentation in reference to the faithful, cf. <a ref='Proverbs 23:18'>Pr 23:18</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 24:14'>24:14</a> , <a ref='Proverbs 24:20'>20</a> . <a ref='Psalms 37:39'>37:39</a> <b>salvation … from Yahweh.</b> Since salvation belongs to Him ( <a ref='Psalms 3:8'>Ps 3:8</a> ), He is the perennial Source of it (cf. <a ref='Psalms 62:1–2'>Ps 62:1–2</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 38:1–22'>38:1–22</a> Prayers surround a core of intense lament (vv. <a ref='Psalms 38:2–20'>2–20</a> ). In many ways David’s laments parallel those of Job. David’s perspective is that his painful plight is due, at least in part, to his personal sin. Organizationally, David’s opening and closing prayers in <a ref='Ps 38'>Ps 38</a> relate to two onslaughts by enemies. I. Introductory Prayer ( <a ref='Psalms 38:1–2'>38:1–2</a> ) II. First Onslaught: The Enemy Within ( <a ref='Psalms 38:3–10'>38:3–10</a> ) III. Second Onslaught: Enemies Without ( <a ref='Psalms 38:11–20'>38:11–20</a> ) IV. Concluding Prayers ( <a ref='Psalms 38:21–22'>38:21–22</a> ) <a ref='Ps 38'>38:Title</a> <b>To bring to remembrance.</b> Lit. “To cause to remember” (cf. the title to <a ref='Ps 70'>Ps 70</a> ). The psalmist either 1) reminds God of his plight so that He might act, or 2) reminds himself and the community of his historic predicament so that both he and they would fervently pray in similar contexts of acute suffering. <a ref='Psalms 38:1'>38:1</a> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 6:1'>Pss 6:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 39:11'>39:11</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 31:18'>Jer 31:18</a> . <a ref='Psalms 38:2'>38:2</a> <b>Your arrows.</b> The language relates to the Divine Warrior motif; on God as Archer, cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:23'>Dt 32:23</a> ; <a ref='Job 6:4'>Job 6:4</a> ; <a ref='Job 16:13'>16:13</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 7:12'>Ps 7:12</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 3:12–13'>Lam 3:12–13</a> ; etc. <a ref='Psalms 38:5'>38:5</a> <b>my folly.</b> On culpable ethical folly, cf. <a ref='Psalms 69:5'>Ps 69:5</a> .

It also carries on the here-today-gone-tomorrow emphasis of <a ref='Ps 37'>Ps 37</a> with a new twist, an application to <i>all</i> men, especially the psalmist. In this intense lament, David will break his initial silence with two rounds of requests and reflections about the brevity and burdens of life. I. Introduction: David’s Silence ( <a ref='Psalms 39:1–3'>39:1–3</a> ) II. Round One: The Brevity and Burdens of Life ( <a ref='Psalms 39:4–6'>39:4–6</a> ) A. His Request for Perspective ( <a ref='Psalms 39:4'>39:4</a> ) B. His Reflections on Perspective ( <a ref='Psalms 39:5–6'>39:5–6</a> ) III.

His Requests for Relief ( <a ref='Psalms 39:12–13'>39:12–13</a> ) <a ref='Ps 39'>39:Title</a> <b>For Jeduthun.</b> This is most likely a specifically designated worship director (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 9:16'>1Chr 9:16</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 16:37'>16:37ff.</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 25:1–3'>25:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 11:17'>Ne 11:17</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 39:1'>39:1</a> <b>I will. … will.</b> The form of these expressions intimate strong volitional commitments. <b>not sin with my tongue.</b> This sinning could have been in one or both of two ways: 1) directly, by criticizing God for not bringing retribution on the wicked, and 2) indirectly, by complaining in the hearing of the wicked. <a ref='Psalms 39:2'>39:2</a> His silence did not ease his pain; it seemed to make it all the worse. <a ref='Psalms 39:3'>39:3</a> Cf.

Yet, he did not violate the conditions of his original commitment, since he did not vent before men, but unloaded his burdens before God (cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 39:4'>4ff.</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 39:4'>39:4</a> For similar prayers about the brevity and burdens of life, cf. <a ref='Job 6:11'>Job 6:11</a> ; <a ref='Job 7:7'>7:7</a> ; <a ref='Job 14:13'>14:13</a> ; <a ref='Job 16:21–22'>16:21–22</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 90:12'>Ps 90:12</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 2:3'>Ecc 2:3</a> . <a ref='Psalms 39:5'>39:5</a> <b>handbreadths.</b> He measures the length of his life with the smallest popular measuring unit of ancient times ( <a ref='1 Kings 7:26'>1Ki 7:26</a> ); cf. “four fingers” (i.e., about 2.9 in.) in <a ref='Jeremiah 52:21'>Jer 52:21</a> . <b>And my lifetime as nothing before You.</b> On “measuring” God’s age, cf. <a ref='Psalms 90:2'>Ps 90:2</a> . <b>vanity.</b> For the same Hebrew word, cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 1:2'>Ecc 1:2ff.</a> , “vanity” (a total of 31 occurrences of this term are in Ecc); <a ref='Psalms 144:4'>Ps 144:4</a> .

Furthermore, the last 5 verses of <a ref='Ps 40'>Ps 40</a> are nearly identical to <a ref='Ps 70'>Ps 70</a> . Crucial associations surface throughout this psalm. The first is between the theocratic king as an individual and the community of the theocratic people. Beyond this, from the vantage point of NT revelation, an association with the Greater David is contained in seed form in vv. <a ref='Psalms 40:6–8'>6–8</a> (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 10:5–7'>Heb 10:5–7</a> ). Historical precedent and prayers for a present plight move the psalm along from beginning to end. Attitudinally, David understood the importance of what would be explicitly commanded through Paul in <a ref='Romans 12:1–2'>Ro 12:1–2</a> . These elements constitute only a part of the richness of <a ref='Ps 40'>Ps 40</a> . The following notes will help to follow David’s mental movements through these 17 verses: two situations constitute the framework for the psalmist’s publicized expressions of worship in <a ref='Ps 40'>Ps 40</a> . I. Precedent from a Past Situation ( <a ref='Psalms 40:1–10'>40:1–10</a> ) A. The Merciful Rescue by God ( <a ref='Psalms 40:1–3'>40:1–3</a> ) B. The Multiple Resources in God ( <a ref='Psalms 40:4–5'>40:4–5</a> ) C. The Motivational Responses to God ( <a ref='Psalms 40:6–10'>40:6–10</a> ) II. Prayers for a Present Situation ( <a ref='Psalms 40:11–17'>40:11–17</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 40:2'>40:2</a> <b>the pit of destruction … the miry clay.</b> The imagery describes his past hopeless and helpless situation; cf. the language of <a ref='Psalms 69:2'>Ps 69:2</a> , <a ref='Psalms 69:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 38:6'>Jer 38:6ff.</a> God by His grace had taken him from no footing to sure footing. <a ref='Psalms 40:3'>40:3</a> <b>a new song.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Psalms 33:3'>Ps 33:3</a> .</i> <a ref='Psalms 40:3–4'>40:3–4</a> <b>trust in Yahweh … Yahweh his trust.</b> The verb and the noun forms of this important Hebrew root connote a faith of confident commitment, here in the right object, God alone (cf. the teaching of <a ref='Jeremiah 17:7'>Jer 17:7</a> ). David’s desire was always to make such commitment contagious. <a ref='Psalms 40:5'>40:5</a> Cf. the psalmist’s pleasant “frustration” in <a ref='Psalms 139:12–18'>Ps 139:12–18</a> . <a ref='Psalms 40:6–8'>40:6–8</a> The author of Hebrews dramatically applies these verses to the Greater David ( <a ref='Hebrews 10:5–7'>10:5–7</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 40:6'>40:6</a> <b>Sacrifice and meal offering You have not desired.</b> He is not negating the commandment to offer sacrifices, but is emphasizing their being offered with the right attitude of heart (contra. Saul, <a ref='1 Samuel 15:22–23'>1Sa 15:22–23</a> ; note the emphases on proper spiritual prerequisites for sacrifices in <a ref='Psalms 19:14'>Pss 19:14</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 50:7–15'>50:7–15</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 51:15–17'>51:15–17</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 69:30–31'>69:30–31</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 1:10–15'>Is 1:10–15</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 7:21–26'>Jer 7:21–26</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 6:6'>Hos 6:6</a> ; <a ref='Amos 5:21–24'>Am 5:21–24</a> ; <a ref='Micah 6:6–8'>Mic 6:6–8</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 23:23'>Mt 23:23</a> ). <b>My ears You have opened.</b> Lit. “ears” or “two ears You have dug for me.” This pictures obedience and dedication. <a ref='Psalms 40:7'>40:7</a> <b>In the scroll of the book it is written of me.</b> <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:14–20'>Deuteronomy 17:14–20</a> would apply to the lesser David; cf. likely applications regarding the Greater David in passages like <a ref='Luke 24:27'>Lk 24:27</a> ; <a ref='John 5:39'>Jn 5:39</a> , <a ref='John 5:46'>46</a> . <a ref='Psalms 40:9'>40:9</a> <b>good news of righteousness.</b> This word for “good news” in Hebrew (cf. the root in <a ref='Isaiah 40:9'>Is 40:9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 41:27'>41:27</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 52:7'>52:7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:6'>60:6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 61:1'>61:1</a> ) is the precursor of the NT terminology for the “gospel” and “preaching the gospel,” i.e., “announcing the good news.” “Righteousness” is identified as God’s righteousness in the next verse (v. <a ref='Psalms 40:10'>10</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 40:10'>40:10</a> David’s spirit here was encountered previously in <a ref='Psalms 22:22–23'>Ps 22:22–23</a> . <a ref='Psalms 40:12'>40:12</a> Cf. both external persecution and internal perversity in <a ref='Ps 38'>Ps 38</a> . <a ref='Psalms 40:13–17'>40:13–17</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Ps 70'>Ps 70</a> .</i> <a ref='Psalms 41:1–13'>41:1–13</a> The words of this psalm are general and apply to anyone who might be considered “down.” The most painful and specific factor addressed here is the insult which is being added to the psalmist’s injury (cf. <a ref='Ps 6'>Pss 6</a> , <a ref='Ps 38'>38</a> ; and portions of Job and Jeremiah). While the form and structure of <a ref='Ps 41'>Ps 41</a> are quite complex, “blessed” serves as bookends in vv. <a ref='Psalms 41:1'>1</a> , <a ref='Psalms 41:13'>13</a> . Within these, other elements include 1) confidence (vv. <a ref='Psalms 41:1–3'>1b–3</a> , <a ref='Psalms 41:11–12'>11–12</a> ), 2) prayers (vv. <a ref='Psalms 41:4'>4</a> , <a ref='Psalms 41:10'>10</a> ), and 3) lament (vv. <a ref='Psalms 41:5–9'>5–9</a> ), with moments of wisdom and praise. David’s message in <a ref='Ps 41'>Ps 41</a> speaks of God’s tender, loving care in the critical care unit of life. I. Recognizes Human Compassion ( <a ref='Psalms 41:1'>41:1a</a> ) II. Revels in God’s Care for the Compassionate ( <a ref='Psalms 41:1–3'>41:1b–3</a> ) III. Requests Grace, Health, and Forgiveness ( <a ref='Psalms 41:4'>41:4</a> ) IV.

On the explicit combination of “sinning against,” cf. <a ref='Psalms 51:4'>Ps 51:4</a> . This perspective of the psalmist does not negate the reference to his basic “integrity” in v. <a ref='Psalms 41:12'>12</a> . <a ref='Psalms 41:6'>41:6</a> <b>And when he comes … he goes outside.</b> This hypocritical “sick call” really adds insult to injury.

Note that Book I of the Psalms ( <a ref='Ps 1-41'>Pss 1–41</a> ) closes with a doxology; cf. the endings of the other 4 books ( <a ref='Psalms 72:18–19'>Pss 72:18–19</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:52'>89:52</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 106:48'>106:48</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 150:6'>150:6</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 42:1–11'>42:1–11</a> As in the case of <a ref='Ps 9'>Pss 9</a> and <a ref='Ps 10'>10</a> , <a ref='Ps 42'>Pss 42</a> and <a ref='Ps 43'>43</a> were originally probably one. Some ancient manuscripts put them together; <a ref='Ps 43'>Ps 43</a> has no title, while the rest around it do. In form, <a ref='Ps 42'>Ps 42</a> may be considered an individual lament. This psalm also exemplifies a primary characteristic of Book II of the Psalms, the preference of the ascription “God” (or parallels to it) for the Deity. The occasion and situation of <a ref='Ps 42'>Ps 42</a> are historically unspecified; however, what is obvious is that the psalmist’s situation was intense and greatly aggravated by his surrounding mockers. Consequently, <a ref='Ps 42'>Ps 42</a> is a dirge of two stanzas. I. Stanza One: The Psalmist Sings of His Drought ( <a ref='Psalms 42:1–5'>42:1–5</a> ) A. The Content of This Stanza ( <a ref='Psalms 42:1–4'>42:1–4</a> ) B. The Chorus of This Dirge (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 42:11'>11</a> ) ( <a ref='Psalms 42:5'>42:5</a> ) II. Stanza Two: The Psalmist Sings of His Drowning ( <a ref='Psalms 42:6–11'>42:6–11</a> ) A. The Content of This Stanza ( <a ref='Psalms 42:6–10'>42:6–10</a> ) B. The Chorus of This Dirge (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 42:5'>5</a> ) ( <a ref='Psalms 42:11'>42:11</a> ) <a ref='Ps 42'>42:Title</a> The references to “the choir director,” i.e., the worship director, and Maskil, a “contemplation” or lesson (see note ; cf. <a ref='Psalms 32:1'>Ps 32:1</a> ) are not new, but the reference to “the sons of Korah” is. On the ancestry of “the sons of Korah,” cf. <a ref='Numbers 26:10'>Nu 26:10ff.</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:16'>1Chr 6:16ff.</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 20:19'>2Chr 20:19</a> . A total of 11 psalms are associated with this group, and 7 of them are found in Book II ( <a ref='Ps 42'>Pss 42</a> , <a ref='Ps 44-49'>44–49</a> ). These people are probably better regarded as the Levitical performers, rather than the authors of these psalms (i.e., “For the sons of Korah”). <a ref='Psalms 42:1'>42:1</a> <b>As the deer pants … my soul pants.</b> On this simile from nature, cf. <a ref='Joel 1:20'>Joel 1:20</a> . In the psalmist’s estimation, he is facing a severe divine drought. <a ref='Psalms 42:2'>42:2</a> <b>My soul thirsts for God.</b> On this desire for the water of God, cf. <a ref='Psalms 36:8–9'>Ps 36:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 41:17'>Is 41:17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 55:1'>55:1</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 2:13'>Jer 2:13</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 14:1–9'>14:1–9</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 17:13'>17:13</a> ; <a ref='John 4:10'>Jn 4:10</a> ; <a ref='John 7:37–38'>7:37–38</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 7:17'>Rev 7:17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 21:6'>21:6</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 22:1'>22:1</a> , <a ref='Revelation 22:17'>17</a> . <a ref='Psalms 42:4'>42:4</a> <b>These things I remember and I pour out my soul.</b> Such language also characterizes Jeremiah’s Lamentations, indicating a heavy dirge. On “pouring out one’s soul” or “heart,” cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 1:15'>1Sa 1:15</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 62:8'>Ps 62:8</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 2:19'>Lam 2:19</a> . These are attempts at trying to unburden oneself from intolerable pain, grief, and agony. <a ref='Psalms 42:5'>42:5</a> <b>in despair … disturbed.</b> In this active introspection the psalmist rebukes himself for his despondency. <a ref='Psalms 42:6'>42:6</a> <b>the land of the Jordan … the peaks of Hermon … Mount Mizar.</b> The Jordan and Mt. Hermon notations refer to a location in northern Israel, an area of headwaters which flow southward. These locations signal that a sharp contrast in the word pictures describing the psalmist’s change in condition is imminent. He is about to move from drought to drowning (cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 42:7'>7ff.</a> ). The location and significance of Mt. Mizar is not known. <a ref='Psalms 42:7'>42:7</a> <b>Deep … Your waterfalls … Your waves.</b> He alleges that God is ultimately responsible for the oceans of trial in which he seems to be drowning. <a ref='Psalms 42:8'>42:8</a> <b>Yahweh will command His lovingkindness.</b> This statement of confidence interrupts his laments (cf. their continuance in vv. <a ref='Psalms 42:9–10'>9–10</a> ), providing a few gracious gulps of divine “air” under the cascading inundations of his trials and tormentors. <a ref='Psalms 43:1–5'>43:1–5</a> <a ref='Ps 43'>Psalm 43</a> might be conceived of as an epilogue to <a ref='Ps 42'>Ps 42</a> . The psalmist moves away from introspection toward invocation. However, as v. <a ref='Psalms 43:5'>5</a> will indicate, the psalmist’s problems had not ended, at least not fully and finally. Nevertheless, spiritual progress is evident. By interrelating the psalmist’s two modes of communication in <a ref='Ps 43'>Ps 43</a> and then by comparing them with the laments of <a ref='Ps 42'>Ps 42</a> , one observes indications of that progress as he continued to deal with his despondency. I. Prayers to God ( <a ref='Psalms 43:1–4'>43:1–4</a> ) A. Righting Wrongs ( <a ref='Psalms 43:1–2'>43:1–2</a> ) B. Restoring “Rights” (i.e., proper or appropriate things) ( <a ref='Psalms 43:3–4'>43:3–4</a> ) II. “Pep-talks” to Oneself ( <a ref='Psalms 43:5'>43:5</a> ) A. Exhortation ( <a ref='Psalms 43:5'>43:5a–b</a> ) B. Encouragement ( <a ref='Psalms 43:5'>43:5c–d</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 43:1'>43:1</a> <b>Give justice to … plead my case.</b> Lit. “Judge me, O God, and argue my case.” This combination of legal terms demonstrates respectively that the psalmist was requesting God to be both his Divine Judge (cf. <a ref='Judges 11:27'>Jdg 11:27</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 24:12'>1Sa 24:12</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 7:8'>Pss 7:8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 26:1'>26:1</a> ) and Defense Attorney (cf. <a ref='Psalms 119:154'>Ps 119:154</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 22:23'>Pr 22:23</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 23:11'>23:11</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 50:34'>Jer 50:34</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 3:58'>Lam 3:58</a> ). On both concepts together, as here, cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 24:15'>1Sa 24:15</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 35:1'>Ps 35:1</a> , <a ref='Psalms 35:24'>24</a> ; <a ref='Micah 7:9'>Mic 7:9</a> . <a ref='Psalms 43:2'>43:2</a> <b>why. … Why…?</b> Since God was his refuge of strength, the psalmist questioned why this divine rejection and why his dejection? <a ref='Psalms 43:3'>43:3</a> <b>Your light and Your truth, let them lead me.</b> These are bold personifications for divine guidance. He desired that these “messenger-attributes” divinely direct (cf. such “leading” and “guiding” in <a ref='Genesis 24:48'>Ge 24:48</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 78:14'>Pss 78:14</a> , <a ref='Psalms 78:53'>53</a> , <a ref='Psalms 78:72'>72</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 107:30'>107:30</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 57:18'>Is 57:18</a> ) so as to bring him successfully to his destination, i.e., Israel’s designated place for worship. <a ref='Psalms 43:5'>43:5</a> <b>Why … why … Wait.</b> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 42:5'>Ps 42:5</a> , <a ref='Psalms 42:11'>11</a> . Anointing of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament Old Testament Israel had mediators who stood between God and His people. To empower the OT mediators, the Holy Spirit gave special administrative ability to carry out the management of the nation and military skills which enabled them to defeat the theocracy’s enemies. The Lord first anointed Moses with this ministry of the Spirit and then, in a truly dramatic scene, took some of this ministry of the Spirit and shared it with the 70 elders. Thus they were enabled to help Moses administer Israel ( <a ref='Numbers 11:17–25'>Nu 11:17–25</a> ). Also Joshua ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:9'>Dt 34:9</a> ), the judges ( <a ref='Judges 3:10'>Jdg 3:10</a> ; <a ref='Judges 6:34'>6:34</a> ), and the kings of united Israel and the southern kingdom were anointed with this special ministry of the Spirit. When the Spirit of the Lord came upon King Saul, for example, “God changed his heart” ( <a ref='1 Samuel 10:6–10'>1Sa 10:6–10</a> ). This does not mean that he was regenerated at this point in his life, but that he was given skills to be a king. Later the theocratic anointing was taken from Saul and given to David ( <a ref='1 Samuel 16:1–14'>1Sa 16:1–14</a> ). Saul, from that time on, became a totally incapable leader. King David no doubt had this special ministry of the Spirit in mind in his prayer of repentance in <a ref='Ps 51'>Psalm 51</a> . He was not afraid of losing his salvation when he prayed, “do not take Your Holy Spirit from me” ( <a ref='Psalms 51:11'>Ps 51:11</a> ), but rather was concerned that God would remove His spiritual wisdom and administrative skill from him. David had earlier seen such a tragedy in the life of Saul when that king of Israel lost the anointing of the Holy Spirit. David was thus pleading with God not to remove His hand of guidance. King Solomon also perceived his youthful inabilities at the beginning of his reign and requested God to give him special wisdom in administering Israel. God was greatly pleased with this request and granted an extra measure to the young man ( <a ref='1 Kings 3:7–12'>1Ki 3:7–12</a> , <a ref='1 Kings 3:28'>28</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 4:29–34'>4:29–34</a> ). Although the OT is silent in this regard about the kings who succeeded Solomon, the theocratic anointing of the Spirit likely came on all of the descendants of David in connection with the Davidic Covenant. When the theocracy went out of existence as Judah was carried away into captivity, and the last Davidic king was disempowered, the theocratic anointing was no longer given ( <a ref='Eze 8-11'>Eze 8–11</a> ). The kings of the northern tribes, on the other hand, being essentially apostate and not in the Davidic line, never had the benefit of this special ministry of the Spirit.

Throughout this psalm there are subtle shifts between speakers of the first person plural (i.e., “We” and “us”; cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 44:1–3'>1–3</a> , <a ref='Psalms 44:5'>5</a> , <a ref='Psalms 44:7–8'>7–8</a> , <a ref='Psalms 44:9–14'>9–14</a> , <a ref='Psalms 44:17–22'>17–22</a> ) and the first person singular (i.e., “I” or “my”; cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 44:4'>4</a> , <a ref='Psalms 44:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Psalms 44:15–16'>15–16</a> ). This may indicate that the psalm was originally sung antiphonally with alterations coming from both the beaten king-general and his defeated nation. The prayers of vv. <a ref='Psalms 44:23–26'>23–26</a> may have been offered in unison as a climax. By employing 3 historical centers in <a ref='Ps 44'>Ps 44</a> , the psalmist tries to understand and deal with a national tragedy. I. Focus on Past History: The Shock of This National Tragedy ( <a ref='Psalms 44:1–8'>44:1–8</a> ) II. Focus on Current History: The Inscrutability of This National Tragedy ( <a ref='Psalms 44:9–22'>44:9–22</a> ) III. Focus on Future History: A Prayer for an End to This National Tragedy ( <a ref='Psalms 44:23–26'>44:23–26</a> ) <a ref='Ps 44'>44:Title</a> The words of this title are the same as those in the title of <a ref='Ps 42'>Ps 42</a> ; however, in the Hebrew text their order is slightly different. <a ref='Psalms 44:1'>44:1</a> <b>we have heard.</b> There was a rich tradition about God’s great acts which the nation’s fathers had passed on. Indeed the rehearsal of holy history was commanded (cf. <a ref='Exodus 10:1–2'>Ex 10:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 12:26'>12:26ff.</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 13:14'>13:14ff.</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:20'>Dt 6:20ff.</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 4:6'>Jos 4:6ff.</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 78:3'>Ps 78:3</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 44:2'>44:2</a> <b>You planted.</b> On the imagery of God’s planting His people, cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 7:10'>2Sa 7:10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 5:1'>Is 5:1ff.</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 12:2'>Jer 12:2</a> ; also cf. their being planted and taking root in <a ref='Psalms 80:8–11'>Ps 80:8–11</a> . <a ref='Psalms 44:3'>44:3</a> <b>they did not … But Your right hand.</b> This is a brief historical summary of the theology of divine grace, intervention, and enablement (cf. <a ref='Joshua 24:17–18'>Jos 24:17–18</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 44:4'>44:4</a> <b>Command salvation for Jacob.</b> If the division of the Hebrew consonants is taken at a different point (as it is in some early versions), this line would better fit into the immediate context, reading: “You are my King, my God, who commands [or, orders] victories for Jacob.” “Jacob,” the original name of the ancient patriarch, is often used to designate the nation of Israel, especially in poetry. <a ref='Psalms 44:5–8'>44:5–8</a> <b>Through You … For I will not trust in my bow … But You have saved us.</b> The defeated king-general picks up the theology of v. <a ref='Psalms 44:3'>3</a> and adds his personal commitment to it. <a ref='Psalms 44:9'>44:9</a> <b>Yet You … do not go out with our armies.</b> The Lord God is viewed here as having resigned His commission as the nation’s Divine Warrior. <a ref='Psalms 44:11–16'>44:11–16</a> <b>You give … You sell.</b> These are graphic descriptions of God superintending the defeat and utter humiliation of the nation. <a ref='Psalms 44:17–21'>44:17–21</a> <b>but we have not forgotten You … If we had forgotten the name of our God.</b> The nation’s recent defeat was painfully perplexing in view of their basic loyalty to God. <a ref='Psalms 44:22'>44:22</a> <b>But for Your sake.</b> They had no specific answers; only this inescapable conclusion that, by God’s sovereign will, they were allowed to be destroyed by their enemies. Cf. Paul’s quote of this verse in <a ref='Romans 8:36'>Ro 8:36</a> and its general principle in <a ref='Matthew 5:10–12'>Mt 5:10–12</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 3:13–17'>1Pe 3:13–17</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 4:12–16'>4:12–16</a> . <a ref='Psalms 44:23'>44:23</a> <b>Arouse … Awake.</b> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 35:23'>Ps 35:23</a> . God does not actually sleep. This is only in appearance to man’s perception. <a ref='Psalms 44:26'>44:26</a> <b>Rise up.</b> Cf. <a ref='Numbers 10:35'>Nu 10:35</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 3:7'>Pss 3:7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 7:6'>7:6</a> . <b>redeem us for … Your lovingkindness.</b> The psalm therefore comes full circle from the history of God’s gracious redemption (vv. <a ref='Psalms 44:1–3'>1–3</a> ) to the hope for the same in the near future (v. <a ref='Psalms 44:26'>26</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 45:1–17'>45:1–17</a> Some portions of <a ref='Ps 45'>Ps 45</a> convey a secular emphasis, while others suggest a sacred extension. Upon the occasion of a royal wedding, the psalmist offers a 3-part song of celebration. I. Poetic Preface ( <a ref='Psalms 45:1'>45:1</a> ) II. Song of Celebration ( <a ref='Psalms 45:2–16'>45:2–16</a> ) A. The King-Groom ( <a ref='Psalms 45:2–9'>45:2–9</a> ) 1. Endowments of the king-groom ( <a ref='Psalms 45:2'>45:2</a> ) 2. Exploits of the king-groom ( <a ref='Psalms 45:3–5'>45:3–5</a> ) 3. Elevation of the king-groom ( <a ref='Psalms 45:6–7'>45:6–7</a> ) 4. Eminence of the king-groom ( <a ref='Psalms 45:8–9'>45:8–9</a> ) B. The Princess-Bride ( <a ref='Psalms 45:10–15'>45:10–15</a> ) 1. A challenge to the princess-bride ( <a ref='Psalms 45:10–12'>45:10–12</a> ) 2. The procession of the princess-bride ( <a ref='Psalms 45:13–15'>45:13–15</a> ) C. Future Children from This Union ( <a ref='Psalms 45:16'>45:16</a> ) III. Poetic Postscript ( <a ref='Psalms 45:17'>45:17</a> ) <a ref='Ps 45'>45:Title</a> Two new notations are found, “According to Shoshannim” and “A Song of Love.” The first most likely had to do with the tune used in accompaniment with its words. The second notation referring to its content probably indicated that this psalm was a wedding song, and even more specifically, a royal wedding composition. <a ref='Psalms 45:1'>45:1</a> <b>My heart overflows … My tongue.</b> The psalmist is overwhelmed with emotion upon the occasion of the king’s marriage; consequently, he puts his stirred-up mind and feelings into words. In v. <a ref='Psalms 45:2'>2ff.</a> his tongue is the brush that he uses to paint vivid word pictures. <a ref='Psalms 45:2'>45:2</a> <b>You are fairer.</b> I.e., you are “more beautiful than,” or, “most handsome among” (cf. an ancient prerequisite for kingship; in the Bible note the comments, e.g., in <a ref='1 Samuel 9:2'>1Sa 9:2</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 10:23'>10:23</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 16:12'>16:12</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 14:25'>2Sa 14:25</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 1:6'>1Ki 1:6</a> ; <a ref='Song of Solomon 5:10'>SS 5:10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 33:17'>Is 33:17</a> ). <b>Grace is poured upon Your lips.</b> The implication is that God has anointed the king’s words (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 10:12'>Ecc 10:12</a> ; <a ref='Luke 4:22'>Lk 4:22</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 45:3–5'>45:3–5</a> <b>Gird Your sword.</b> In these verses the psalmist wishes the king future victories in battle. <a ref='Psalms 45:6–7'>45:6–7</a> <b>Your throne, O God.</b> Since this king-groom was likely a member of the Davidic dynasty (e.g., <a ref='2Sa 7'>2Sa 7</a> ), there was a near and immediate application (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 28:5'>1Chr 28:5</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 29:23'>29:23</a> ). Through progressive revelation (i.e., <a ref='Hebrews 1:8–9'>Heb 1:8–9</a> ), we learn of the ultimate application to “a greater than Solomon” who is God—the Lord Jesus Christ. <a ref='Psalms 45:9'>45:9</a> <b>Kings’ daughters … noble ladies … the queen.</b> This court picture could refer to royal female guests, but also includes the other wives and concubines of the king-groom (cf. the situation with Solomon in <a ref='1 Kings 11:1'>1Ki 11:1</a> ). Such polygamy, of course, was prohibited by God’s Word; unfortunately, it was still common among the kings of Israel. <b>gold from Ophir.</b> Although its geographical location is not known, “Ophir” was well known as the location of the purest gold. <a ref='Psalms 45:10–15'>45:10–15</a> <b>O daughter.</b> The major emphasis of this portion is “Here comes the bride!” However, even in this section the focus still concentrates, according to ancient Near Eastern precedent, upon the royal groom. <a ref='Psalms 45:16'>45:16</a> <b>In place of your fathers will be your sons.</b> The loyal and joyful poet now speaks of the blessings of anticipated children from this union. <a ref='Psalms 46:1–11'>46:1–11</a> <a ref='Ps 46'>Psalm 46</a> was the scriptural catalyst for Martin Luther’s great hymn, “A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.” This psalm also launches a trilogy of psalms (i.e., <a ref='Ps 46-47'>46–47</a> , <a ref='Ps 48'>48</a> ); they are all songs of triumph. Furthermore, it has also been grouped among the so-called “songs of Zion” (cf. <a ref='Ps 48'>Pss 48</a> , <a ref='Ps 76'>76</a> , <a ref='Ps 84'>84</a> , <a ref='Ps 87'>87</a> , <a ref='Ps 122'>122</a> ). <a ref='Ps 46'>Psalm 46</a> extols the adequacy of God in facing threats from nature and the nations. God indeed protects (cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 46:1'>1</a> , <a ref='Psalms 46:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Psalms 46:11'>11</a> ) His people upon the earth (cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 46:2'>2</a> , <a ref='Psalms 46:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Psalms 46:8–10'>8–10</a> ). The major burden of <a ref='Ps 46'>Ps 46</a> is that God provides stability for His people who live in two exceedingly unstable environments. I. The Unstable Environment of Nature ( <a ref='Psalms 46:1–3'>46:1–3</a> ) A. The Affirmation of His Stability ( <a ref='Psalms 46:1'>46:1</a> ) B. The Application of His Stability ( <a ref='Psalms 46:2–3'>46:2–3</a> ) II. The Unstable Environment of the Nations ( <a ref='Psalms 46:4–11'>46:4–11</a> ) A. The First Chorus ( <a ref='Psalms 46:4–7'>46:4–7</a> ) B. The Follow-Up Chorus ( <a ref='Psalms 46:8–11'>46:8–11</a> ) <a ref='Ps 46'>46:Title</a> The new element in this title is “Alamoth.” The early Greek translation (LXX) interprets this technical term as “hidden things.” However, the Hebrew word normally has to do with “girls” or “young maidens.” Consequently, the most likely conjecture about this phrase is that it is a technical musical notation, possibly indicating a song which was to be sung with female voices at a higher range. <a ref='Psalms 46:2'>46:2</a> <b>though the earth should change.</b> I.e., “When earth changes and when mountains move (or) shake (or) totter (or) slip. …” (cf. the language of <a ref='Isaiah 24:19–20'>Is 24:19–20</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 54:10'>54:10</a> ; <a ref='Haggai 2:6'>Hag 2:6</a> ). These are poetic allusions to earthquakes. Since “the earth” and “mountains” are regarded by men as symbols of stability, when they “dance” great terror normally ensues. But when the most stable becomes unstable, there should be “no fear” because of the transcendent stability of God. <a ref='Psalms 46:3'>46:3</a> <b>Though its waters roar.</b> This is an illustration of powerfully surging and potentially destructive floods of waters. These will not erode God’s protective fortifications. <a ref='Psalms 46:4'>46:4</a> <b>There is a river whose streams.</b> These words about refreshing waters contrast with those about the threatening torrents of v. <a ref='Psalms 46:3'>3</a> . Cf. the garden of paradise concept often mentioned in ancient Near Eastern literature, but most importantly, cf. the biblical revelation, noting especially the “bookends” of <a ref='Genesis 2:10'>Ge 2:10</a> and <a ref='Revelation 22:1–2'>Rev 22:1–2</a> . <b>the city of God.</b> These words in their present setting refer to Jerusalem, God’s chosen earthly residence (cf. <a ref='Psalms 48:1–2'>Ps 48:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:14'>Is 60:14</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 46:5–6'>46:5–6</a> <b>she will not be shaken.</b> These verses pick up some of the key terms about moving, slipping, tottering, sliding, and roaring from vv. <a ref='Psalms 46:1–3'>1–3</a> ; however, here, because of the presence of God, the forces of nature and the nations are no longer a threat to the people of God who dwell with Him. <a ref='Psalms 46:7'>46:7</a> <b>Yahweh of hosts is with us.</b> The precious personal presence (cf. “God with us” in <a ref='Isaiah 7:14'>Is 7:14</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 8:8'>8:8</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 8:10'>10</a> ) of the Divine Warrior (cf. “Yahweh of hosts” or “armies,” e.g., <a ref='Psalms 24:10'>Pss 24:10</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 48:8'>48:8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 59:5'>59:5</a> ) secures the safety of His people. <a ref='Psalms 46:8'>46:8</a> <b>desolations.</b> This word not only characterizes God’s past exploits, but it is also employed in various “Day of Yahweh” contexts (e.g., <a ref='Isaiah 13:9'>Is 13:9</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 5:9'>Hos 5:9</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 2:15'>Zep 2:15</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 46:10'>46:10</a> <b>Cease</b> striving <b>and know that I am God.</b> These twin commands to not panic and to recognize His sovereignty are probably directed to both His nation for comfort and all other nations for warning. <a ref='Psalms 47:1–9'>47:1–9</a> The main concepts of <a ref='Ps 47'>Ps 47</a> develop around key words and phrases, e.g., “peoples” and “nations” (vv. <a ref='Psalms 47:1'>1</a> , <a ref='Psalms 47:3'>3</a> , <a ref='Psalms 47:8–9'>8–9</a> ); “earth” and “all the earth” (vv. <a ref='Psalms 47:2'>2</a> , <a ref='Psalms 47:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Psalms 47:9'>9</a> ); and “king” or “reigning (as king)” (vv. <a ref='Psalms 47:2'>2</a> , <a ref='Psalms 47:6–8'>6–8</a> ). The major message of this psalm is that God is the unique Sovereign over all. Structurally, there are two choruses of worship in <a ref='Ps 47'>Ps 47</a> which celebrate this universal kingship of the Lord God Most High. I. First Chorus: God as the Victorious King-Warrior ( <a ref='Psalms 47:1–5'>47:1–5</a> ) A. Its Call to Worship ( <a ref='Psalms 47:1'>47:1</a> ) B. Its Causes for Worship ( <a ref='Psalms 47:2–5'>47:2–5</a> ) II. Second Chorus: God as the Sovereign King-Governor ( <a ref='Psalms 47:6–9'>47:6–9</a> ) A. Its Call to Worship ( <a ref='Psalms 47:6'>47:6</a> ) B. Its Causes for Worship ( <a ref='Psalms 47:7–9'>47:7–9b</a> ) C. Its Code of Worship ( <a ref='Psalms 47:9'>47:9c</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 47:1'>47:1</a> <b>all peoples.</b> The call to worship is universal. <a ref='Psalms 47:3'>47:3</a> <b>He subdues.</b> An axiomatic truth about the past, present, and future. <a ref='Psalms 47:4'>47:4</a> <b>He chooses.</b> Again, “He chooses” serves as a timeless truth. Cf. the election of Israel in <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:6'>Dt 7:6ff.</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 135:4'>Ps 135:4</a> . On the land of promise as “inheritance,” cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:8–9'>Dt 32:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 105:11'>Ps 105:11</a> . <i>See notes on <a ref='Ephesians 1:4'>Eph 1:4</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:2'>1Pe 1:2</a></i> for a discussion of the doctrine of divine election. <b>The pride of Jacob whom He loves.</b> The “glory” or “pride” of Jacob also refers to the land of Canaan (cf. the term illustratively in <a ref='Isaiah 13:19'>Is 13:19</a> ; then in <a ref='Isaiah 60:15'>Is 60:15</a> ; <a ref='Nahum 2:2'>Na 2:2</a> ; etc.). “Whom He loves” is signal terminology for God’s special, elective, covenantal “love” (cf., e.g., <a ref='Malachi 1:2'>Mal 1:2ff.</a> ). This special focus on God’s covenant with Israel does not negate the bigger picture involving blessing to all nations sketched out in the original Abrahamic Covenant of <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> . <a ref='Psalms 47:5'>47:5</a> <b>God has ascended with a loud shout.</b> The imagery likely refers to God’s presence, after having gone into battle with His people, now ascending victoriously to His immanent “residence” on Mt. Zion and to His transcendent residence in heaven. This procession with the ark of God was accompanied by great shouts and blasts of celebration in vv. <a ref='Psalms 47:5–6'>5–6</a> . <a ref='Psalms 47:9'>47:9</a> <b>the shields of the earth.</b> This imagery stands parallel with “the princes of the people.” Illustratively, there may be a loose analogy to God’s sovereignly appointed human governors (cf. <a ref='Romans 13:1–7'>Ro 13:1–7</a> ) as protectors for the masses. <a ref='Psalms 48:1–14'>48:1–14</a> In <a ref='Ps 48'>Ps 48</a> , it often appears that Zion itself is the object of praise. While referring to Zion, this hymn of confidence (cf. <a ref='Ps 46-47'>Pss 46–47</a> ) contains several checks and balances showing that it is ultimately God, who dwells in Zion, who is to be praised. Therefore, this perspective must be kept in mind as the lines of <a ref='Ps 48'>Ps 48</a> flow back and forth with respective emphases on the city and the great God of that city. This psalm, sung with orchestral accompaniment, therefore contrasts two different responses to the God of Zion and the Zion of God. I. Introduction ( <a ref='Psalms 48:1–3'>48:1–3</a> ) II. The Panic-Response of the Provokers of God ( <a ref='Psalms 48:4–7'>48:4–7</a> ) A. The Chronicling of It ( <a ref='Psalms 48:4–6'>48:4–6</a> ) B. The Cause of It ( <a ref='Psalms 48:7'>48:7</a> ) III. The Praise-Response of the People of God ( <a ref='Psalms 48:8–14'>48:8–14</a> ) A. Their Celebration ( <a ref='Psalms 48:8–13'>48:8–13</a> ) B. Their Conclusion ( <a ref='Psalms 48:14'>48:14</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 48:2'>48:2</a> <b>the joy of the whole earth.</b> Cf. the judgment context of <a ref='Lamentations 2:15'>Lam 2:15</a> . <b>the far north.</b> “North” is an interpretive translation of a word term that occurs as a Semitic place name, i.e., “Zaphon.” In Canaanite mythology Zaphon was an ancient Near Eastern equivalent to Mt. Olympus, the dwelling place of pagan gods. If this was the psalmist’s intention in <a ref='Psalms 48:2'>Ps 48:2</a> , the reference becomes a polemical description of Yahweh; He is not only King of kings but also is God of all so-called gods. <b>The city of the great King.</b> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 47:2'>Ps 47:2</a> and <a ref='Matthew 5:34–35'>Mt 5:34–35</a> . God Himself has always been the King of kings. <a ref='Psalms 48:3'>48:3</a> <b>God, in her palaces.</b> Better, “God is in her citadels, or fortresses.” The context points to the military connotation of this word. <a ref='Psalms 48:4–7'>48:4–7</a> This dramatic, poetic rapid-fire, historical rehearsal of events chronicles some serious threat to Jerusalem from a hostile coalition of forces. They had come arrogantly to destroy Jerusalem, the Zion of God; but the God of Zion surprisingly and powerfully devastated them. <a ref='Psalms 48:7'>48:7</a> <b>the ships of Tarshish.</b> A notable Mediterranean port of uncertain location (cf. <a ref='Jonah 1:3'>Jon 1:3</a> ), possibly Spain. <a ref='Psalms 48:8'>48:8</a> <b>As we have heard, so have we seen.</b> Cf. the personal, individual testimony of Job (i.e., <a ref='Job 42:5'>42:5</a> ). The historical tradition of vv. <a ref='Psalms 48:1–3'>1–3</a> had been proven true once again in the events of vv. <a ref='Psalms 48:4–7'>4–7</a> . <a ref='Psalms 48:11'>48:11</a> <b>the daughters of Judah.</b> This phrase would refer to the surrounding cities and villages. <a ref='Psalms 48:14'>48:14</a> <b>For this is God.</b> Other options for translating the Hebrew text of this line are: 1) “For this God is our God,” or 2) “For this is God, our God.” <a ref='Psalms 49:1–20'>49:1–20</a> <a ref='Ps 49'>Psalm 49</a> deals with the most real thing about life—the certainty of death. One of its major lessons is that “you really can’t take it with you.” Containing these kinds of very practical lessons about life and death, it falls neatly into the category of a didactic or wisdom poem. At places it sounds very much like portions of Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes. It contains warnings to the rich and famous and words of comfort for the poor. These timeless OT messages undergird many NT passages, such as the accounts about the rich fool in <a ref='Luke 12:13–21'>Lk 12:13–21</a> or the rich man and Lazarus in <a ref='Lu 16'>Lk 16</a> . After a fairly lengthy introduction the body of the psalm falls into two parts as indicated by the climaxing refrain in vv. <a ref='Psalms 49:12'>12</a> and <a ref='Psalms 49:20'>20</a> . The wisdom poet of <a ref='Ps 49'>Ps 49</a> developed his somber theme in two stages, focusing on death as the universal experience of all men. I. Introduction ( <a ref='Psalms 49:1–4'>49:1–4</a> ) II. Stage One: The Common Experience <i>of</i> Death ( <a ref='Psalms 49:5–12'>49:5–12</a> ) A.

Stage Two: The Contrasting Experience <i>in</i> Death ( <a ref='Psalms 49:13–20'>49:13–20</a> ) A. The Assurance of This Contrasting Experience in Death ( <a ref='Psalms 49:13–15'>49:13–15</a> ) B. The Application of This Contrasting Experience in Death ( <a ref='Psalms 49:16–20'>49:16–20</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 49:1'>49:1</a> <b>all peoples … all inhabitants.</b> The scope of his message is geographically universal. <a ref='Psalms 49:2'>49:2</a> <b>low and high … Rich and poor.</b> Note the chiastic order (i.e., A-B-B-A) of these descriptives. The scope of his message is also socially universal. <a ref='Psalms 49:3–4'>49:3–4</a> <b>wisdom … discernment … proverb … riddle.</b> All these are wisdom terms (cf. respectively, <a ref='Proverbs 1:20'>Pr 1:20</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 9:1'>9:1</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 14:1'>14:1</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 24:7'>24:7</a> ; then <a ref='Proverbs 2:3'>Pr 2:3</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 3:13'>3:13</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 5:1'>5:1</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 14:29'>14:29</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 18:2'>18:2</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 19:8'>19:8</a> ; next <a ref='Proverbs 1:6'>Pr 1:6</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 17:2'>Eze 17:2</a> ; and finally, <a ref='Judges 14:12'>Jdg 14:12ff.</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 49:5'>49:5</a> <b>the iniquity of my supplanters.</b> This indicates evil chasing him. <a ref='Psalms 49:6'>49:6</a> <b>those who trust in their wealth.</b> Mankind’s propensity to trust in his own material goods is well attested in Scripture (e.g., <a ref='Psalms 52:7'>Ps 52:7</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 17:5'>Jer 17:5</a> ). Biblically this is exposed as the epitome of foolishness (cf., e.g., <a ref='Proverbs 23:4–5'>Pr 23:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Luke 12:16'>Lk 12:16ff.</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 49:7–9'>49:7–9</a> <b>no man can.</b> No person, regardless of his means, is able to escape death; it is inevitable ( <a ref='Hebrews 9:27'>Heb 9:27</a> ). This passage anticipates the second death of hell (cf. <a ref='Revelation 20:11–15'>Rev 20:11–15</a> ), except for those who by faith have repented of their sin and embraced the only adequate ransom—the one paid by the Lord Jesus Christ with His death on the cross (cf. <a ref='Matthew 20:28'>Mt 20:28</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:18–19'>1Pe 1:18–19</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 49:9–10'>49:9b–10a</a> <b>not see corruption … For he sees.</b> The irony is obvious; the wealthy person somehow hopes to get around death, yet he witnesses people constantly dying all around him, from the wise to the foolish. <a ref='Psalms 49:12'>49:12</a> <b>But man … will not endure.</b> This refrain (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 49:20'>20</a> ) is the main point of the psalm. Cf. this concept in <a ref='Ecclesiastes 3:19'>Ecc 3:19</a> . While man and beast both die, man’s spirit lives on eternally but beasts have no life after death. <a ref='Psalms 49:14'>49:14</a> <b>As sheep they are appointed for Sheol; Death will shepherd them.</b> More irony; they are considered as sheep once noted for their grazing; now death shall graze on them. <b>the upright shall have dominion … in the morning.</b> This harbinger of good news to come (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 49:15'>15</a> ) interrupts this long series of confirmations of the condemnation of the self-reliant. <a ref='Psalms 49:15'>49:15</a> <b>But God will redeem my soul … He will receive me.</b> This is one of the greatest affirmations of confidence in God in the Psalms. Although the faithless person cannot buy his way out of death (v. <a ref='Psalms 49:7'>7ff.</a> ), the faithful one is redeemed by the only Redeemer, God Himself. On the significance of the word “receive,” cf. <a ref='Genesis 5:24'>Ge 5:24</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 2:10'>2Ki 2:10</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 73:24'>Ps 73:24</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 11:5'>Heb 11:5</a> . So in v. <a ref='Psalms 49:15'>15</a> the psalmist expresses his confidence in God that He would raise him to eternal life. <a ref='Psalms 49:17'>49:17</a> <b>he will not take any of it.</b> An explicit you-can’t-take-it-with-you attestation (cf. <a ref='Job 1:21'>Job 1:21</a> ; <a ref='Ecclesiastes 5:15'>Ecc 5:15</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 6:6–7'>1Ti 6:6–7</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 49:20'>49:20</a> <b>Man … but</b> who <b>does not understand.</b> The refrain is similar to that of v. <a ref='Psalms 49:12'>12</a> . <a ref='Psalms 50:1–23'>50:1–23</a> God Himself is quoted throughout the psalm. Consequently, its form resembles the prophetic writings which specialized in delivering divine oracles. Its major burden is to delineate the nature of true worship (i.e., “worship in spirit and truth,” cf. <a ref='John 4:24'>Jn 4:24</a> ). The psalmist skillfully develops this burden in a polemical fashion with its exposures of externalism and hypocrisy. The Lord God, the Supreme Judge, levels two felony charges against His professing people. I. Introduction: The Supreme Judge Enters to Preside ( <a ref='Psalms 50:1–6'>50:1–6</a> ) II. The Supreme Judge Levels Two Charges ( <a ref='Psalms 50:7–21'>50:7–21</a> ) A. First Charge: Ritualism ( <a ref='Psalms 50:7–15'>50:7–15</a> ) B. Second Charge: Rebellion ( <a ref='Psalms 50:16–21'>50:16–21</a> ) III. The Supreme Judge Offers a Solution ( <a ref='Psalms 50:22–23'>50:22–23</a> ) <a ref='Ps 50'>50:Title</a> This is the first psalm entitled “A Psalm of Asaph” (cf. <a ref='Ps 73-83'>Pss 73–83</a> in Book III of Psalms). For references to “Asaph,” cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 6:39'>1Chr 6:39</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 15:16'>15:16ff.</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 16:5'>16:5ff.</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 25:1'>25:1ff.</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 5:12'>2Chr 5:12</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 29:30'>29:30</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 2:41'>Ezr 2:41</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 12:46'>Ne 12:46</a> . Sometimes the simple “Asaph” may stand for the longer expression “the sons of Asaph.” Each occasion needs to be examined to see what the relationship between a given psalm and “Asaph” might be, i.e., composed by, handed down by, sung by this special Levitical choir. Many older commentators feel that <a ref='Ps 50'>Ps 50</a> was authored by the original “Asaph.” <a ref='Psalms 50:1'>50:1</a> <b>The Mighty One, God, Yahweh.</b> The Divine Judge is introduced with three significant OT names. The first two are the short and longer forms of the most common word for “God” in the OT, and the third is the name for Israel’s God par excellence, i.e., Yahweh (cf. its historical origin in <a ref='Exodus 3:14'>Ex 3:14</a> ). <b>from the rising of the sun to its setting.</b> A common OT idiom conveying from east to west, i.e., all over the planet. <a ref='Psalms 50:2–3'>50:2–3</a> <b>God has shone forth.</b> These verses utilize the language of theophany (cf. <a ref='Exodus 19:16–19'>Ex 19:16–19</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 50:4–5'>50:4–5</a> <b>He calls the heavens … the earth … His people … My holy ones.</b> He summons the heavens and the earth as personified witnesses for these charges He is about to level concerning His professing people (cf., e.g., <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:1'>Dt 32:1ff.</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 1:2'>Is 1:2ff.</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 50:5'>50:5</a> <b>a covenant with Me by sacrifice.</b> Such a ratification of covenant is serious, sacred business (cf. <a ref='Exodus 24:3–8'>Ex 24:3–8</a> ). This reference to “sacrifice” will set the stage for His first felony charge in v. <a ref='Psalms 50:7'>7ff.</a> <a ref='Psalms 50:8'>50:8</a> <b>I do not reprove you for your sacrifices.</b> The Divine Judge’s condemnations are directed not at the act of sacrifice but at the people’s attitude in sacrificing (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 15:22'>1Sa 15:22</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 40:6–8'>Pss 40:6–8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 51:17'>51:17</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 69:30'>69:30</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 1:12'>Is 1:12</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 7:21–26'>Jer 7:21–26</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 6:6'>Hos 6:6</a> ; <a ref='Micah 6:6–8'>Mic 6:6–8</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 50:9–13'>50:9–13</a> <b>shall take no young bull out of your house.</b> God refuses mere ritual; it is an abomination to Him. He, unlike the pagan deities, needs nothing; He created everything and owns everything. <a ref='Psalms 50:14'>50:14</a> <b>Offer to God … thanksgiving.</b> Here is the sacrifice that always pleases Him (cf. <a ref='Psalms 51:17'>Ps 51:17</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 13:15'>Heb 13:15</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 50:16–20'>50:16–20</a> <b>the wicked.</b> Whereas the first charge dealt with a vertical relationship (cf. the first tablet of the Ten Commandments), this one in v. <a ref='Psalms 50:16'>16ff.</a> focuses on evidences of horizontal violations of covenant (i.e., rebellion against God in the context of man to fellow man offenses; cf. the second half of the Ten Commandments). <a ref='Psalms 50:21'>50:21</a> <b>I kept silent. … will reprove you.</b> God’s longsuffering grace must never be looked upon as laxity (cf. <a ref='2 Peter 3:3–10'>2Pe 3:3–10</a> ) nor abused. His reckoning for rebellion will indeed be manifested. <a ref='Psalms 50:22'>50:22</a> <b>Now consider this.</b> Before destruction, mercifully comes an opportunity for deliberation and repentance. <a ref='Psalms 50:23'>50:23</a> <b>He who offers … thanksgiving glorifies Me.</b> Cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 50:14'>14</a> . This remains the remedy for mere ritualism. The conclusions of vv. <a ref='Psalms 50:22'>22</a> and <a ref='Psalms 50:23'>23</a> came in chiastic order, heightening the total impact of the psalm’s two felony charges (i.e., the recounting of <i>ritualism</i> , vv. <a ref='Psalms 50:7–15'>7–15</a> ; the recounting of <i>rebellion</i> , vv. <a ref='Psalms 50:16–21'>16–21</a> ; the remedy of repentance for <i>rebellion</i> , v. <a ref='Psalms 50:22'>22</a> ; the remedy of repentance for <i>ritualism</i> , v. <a ref='Psalms 50:23'>23</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 51:1–19'>51:1–19</a> This is the classic passage in the OT on man’s repentance and God’s forgiveness of sin. Along with <a ref='Ps 32'>Ps 32</a> , it was written by David after his affair with Bathsheba and his murder of Uriah, her husband ( <a ref='2Sa 11'>2Sa 11</a> ; <a ref='2Sa 12'>12</a> ). It is one of 7 poems called penitential psalms ( <a ref='Ps 6'>6</a> , <a ref='Ps 32'>32</a> , <a ref='Ps 38'>38</a> , <a ref='Ps 51'>51</a> , <a ref='Ps 102'>102</a> , <a ref='Ps 130'>130</a> , <a ref='Ps 143'>143</a> ). To David’s credit, he recognized fully how horrendous his sin was against God, blamed no one but himself, and begged for divine forgiveness. I. Plea for Forgiveness ( <a ref='Psalms 51:1–2'>51:1–2</a> ) II. Proffer of Confession ( <a ref='Psalms 51:3–6'>51:3–6</a> ) III. Prayer for Moral Cleanness ( <a ref='Psalms 51:7–12'>51:7–12</a> ) IV. Promise of Renewed Service ( <a ref='Psalms 51:13–17'>51:13–17</a> ) V. Petition for National Restoration ( <a ref='Psalms 51:18–19'>51:18–19</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 51:1'>51:1</a> <b>lovingkindness.</b> Even though he had sinned horribly, David knew that forgiveness was available, based on God’s covenant love. <a ref='Psalms 51:4'>51:4</a> <b>Against You, You only.</b> David realized what every believer seeking forgiveness must; even though he had tragically wronged Bathsheba and Uriah, his ultimate crime was against God and His holy law (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 11:27'>2Sa 11:27</a> ). <a ref='Romans 3:4'>Romans 3:4</a> quotes <a ref='Psalms 51:4'>Ps 51:4</a> . <a ref='Psalms 51:5'>51:5</a> <b>brought forth in iniquity.</b> David also acknowledged that his sin was not God’s fault in any way (vv. <a ref='Psalms 51:4'>4b</a> , <a ref='Psalms 51:6'>6</a> ), nor was it some aberration. Rather, the source of David’s sin was a fallen, sinful disposition, his since conception. <a ref='Psalms 51:7'>51:7</a> <b>hyssop.</b> Old Testament priests used hyssop, a leafy plant, to sprinkle blood or water on a person being ceremonially cleansed from defilements such as leprosy or touching a dead body (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 14:6'>Lv 14:6ff.</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 19:16–19'>Nu 19:16–19</a> ). Here hyssop is a figure for David’s longing to be spiritually cleansed from his moral defilement. In forgiveness, God washes away sin (cf. <a ref='Psalms 103:12'>Ps 103:12</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 1:16'>Is 1:16</a> ; <a ref='Micah 7:19'>Mic 7:19</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 51:8'>51:8</a> <b>bones.</b> A figure of speech for the framework of the entire person. He was experiencing personal collapse under guilt (cf. <a ref='Psalms 32:3–4'>Ps 32:3–4</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 51:11'>51:11</a> <b>Your Holy Spirit from me.</b> This is a reference to the special Holy Spirit anointing on theocratic mediators. <a ref='Psalms 51:12'>51:12</a> <b>willing spirit.</b> God is generous, willing, and eager to uphold the believer. This mention of spirit possibly refers to the Holy Spirit. <a ref='Psalms 51:16'>51:16</a> <b>You do not delight in sacrifice.</b> Ritual without genuine repentance is useless. However, with a right heart attitude, sacrifices were acceptable (see v. <a ref='Psalms 51:19'>19</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 52:1–9'>52:1–9</a> This psalm is a poetic lesson about the futility of evil, the final triumph of righteousness, and the sovereign control of God over the moral events of history. The event in David’s life which motivated him to write this psalm is recorded in <a ref='1Sa 21-22'>1Sa 21–22</a> . I. The Rashness of the Wicked ( <a ref='Psalms 52:1–5'>52:1–5</a> ) II. The Reaction of the Righteous ( <a ref='Psalms 52:6–7'>52:6–7</a> ) III. The Rejoicing of the Godly ( <a ref='Psalms 52:8–9'>52:8–9</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 52:1'>52:1</a> <b>mighty man.</b> A reference to Doeg, the chief of Saul’s shepherds, who reported to Saul that the priests of Nob had aided David when he was a fugitive (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 22:9'>1Sa 22:9</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 22:18–19'>18–19</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 52:5'>52:5</a> <b>God will break you down.</b> Ultimately, the wicked are in the hands of a holy God (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 9:27'>Heb 9:27</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 52:6'>52:6</a> <b>see and fear.</b> God’s punishment of the wicked serves as a reinforcement to the righteous to obey God. <b>will laugh at him.</b> In the end, the wicked become a laughingstock in a universe controlled by God. <a ref='Psalms 52:8'>52:8</a> <b>green olive tree.</b> The psalmist exults (through this simile) that the one who trusts in the mercy of God is productive and secure. <a ref='Psalms 53:1–6'>53:1–6</a> This psalm is nearly identical to <a ref='Ps 14'>Ps 14</a> ( <a ref='Psalms 53:1–5'>Ps 53:1–5a</a> is from <a ref='Psalms 14:1–5'>Ps 14:1–5a</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 53:6'>Ps 53:6</a> is from <a ref='Psalms 4:7'>Ps 4:7</a> ). The major difference is v. <a ref='Psalms 53:5'>5</a> , in which the psalmist celebrates a military victory over an enemy. Apparently <a ref='Ps 14'>Ps 14</a> is here rephrased to apply to a specified war event, earning it a distinct place in the canon. I. The Description of Those Who Reject God and His People ( <a ref='Psalms 53:1–4'>53:1–4</a> ) II. The Danger to Those Who Reject God and His People ( <a ref='Psalms 53:5'>53:5</a> ) III. The Deliverance of His People ( <a ref='Psalms 53:6'>53:6</a> ) <a ref='Ps 53'>53:Title</a> <b>Mahalath.</b> The name of a tune or an instrument. <a ref='Psalms 53:1–4'>53:1–4</a> <i>See notes on <a ref='Ps 14'>Ps 14</a> .</i> <a ref='Romans 3:10–12'>Romans 3:10–12</a> quotes <a ref='Psalms 53:1–3'>Ps 53:1–3</a> . <a ref='Psalms 53:2'>53:2</a> <b>God.</b> The reference to “God” rather than “Lord” is another difference between <a ref='Ps 14'>Ps 14</a> and <a ref='Ps 53'>53</a> . “Elohim” is used 3 times in <a ref='Ps 14'>Ps 14</a> , but 7 times in <a ref='Ps 53'>Ps 53</a> . <a ref='Psalms 53:5'>53:5</a> <b>in great dread.</b> The verse describes a sudden reversal in the fortunes of war. The haughty enemy besieging Israel was suddenly terrified and utterly defeated. Historical examples of such unexpected terrors to Israel’s enemy are recorded in <a ref='2Ch 20'>2Chr 20</a> and <a ref='Is 37'>Is 37</a> . <b>scattered the bones.</b> Perhaps nothing was more disgraceful to a nation at war than to have the bones of its dead army scattered over the land rather than buried. <a ref='Psalms 54:1–7'>54:1–7</a> This psalm apparently comes from the same period of David’s life as does <a ref='Ps 52'>Ps 52</a> . Even though David had recently rescued an Israelite border town from the Philistines, he was still considered a traitor to Saul ( <a ref='1Sa 23'>1Sa 23</a> and <a ref='1Sa 26'>26</a> ). In the wake of this emotional devastation, David prayed to God for vindication. The psalm provides encouragement to any believer who has been maligned. I. The Prayer for Deliverance ( <a ref='Psalms 54:1–3'>54:1–3</a> ) II. The Anticipation of Deliverance ( <a ref='Psalms 54:4–5'>54:4–5</a> ) III. The Thanksgiving for Deliverance ( <a ref='Psalms 54:6–7'>54:6–7</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 54:1'>54:1</a> <b>by Your name.</b> In the ancient world, a person’s name was essentially the person himself. Here, God’s name includes His covenant protection. <b>render justice.</b> David requests that God will execute justice for him, as in a court trial when a defendant is declared not guilty. <a ref='Psalms 54:2'>54:2</a> <b>Give ear.</b> An anthropomorphism meaning “listen,” “pay attention.” <a ref='Psalms 54:3'>54:3</a> <b>strangers.</b> Either non-Israelites or Israelites who had broken the covenant with God might be called strangers. Since in this case Saul and the Ziphites are the oppressors, the strangers are apostate Israelites (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 23:19'>1Sa 23:19</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 26:1'>26:1</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 54:5'>54:5</a> <b>in Your truth.</b> Since God is omniscient, He can execute perfect justice against the wicked. <a ref='Psalms 54:7'>54:7</a> <b>looked</b> in triumph. David anticipates with confidence that which he has seen in the past—the defeat of his enemies. <a ref='Psalms 55:1–23'>55:1–23</a> In this individual lament, David pours out his heart to his Lord because a former close friend has betrayed him (vv. <a ref='Psalms 55:12–14'>12–14</a> ). There is a strong possibility that this psalm was occasioned by the betrayal of Absalom and/or Ahithophel (cf. <a ref='2Sa 15-18'>2Sa 15–18</a> ). Most of the psalm alternates between prayers for his enemy’s ruin (vv. <a ref='Psalms 55:9'>9</a> , <a ref='Psalms 55:15'>15</a> , <a ref='Psalms 55:19'>19</a> , <a ref='Psalms 55:23'>23</a> ) and praises for God’s blessings (vv. <a ref='Psalms 55:16'>16</a> , <a ref='Psalms 55:18'>18</a> , <a ref='Psalms 55:22'>22</a> ). The high point of the psalm for Christians who have been “stabbed in the back” by a confidant is v. <a ref='Psalms 55:22'>22</a> . Though despairing, David expresses ultimate confidence in God. I. The Prayer of Distress ( <a ref='Psalms 55:1–8'>55:1–8</a> ) II. The Prayer for Justice ( <a ref='Psalms 55:9–15'>55:9–15</a> ) III. The Prayer of Assurance ( <a ref='Psalms 55:16–23'>55:16–23</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 55:3'>55:3</a> <b>shake wickedness down.</b> The verb pictures something being tipped over, crashing down on the victim. <a ref='Psalms 55:6'>55:6</a> <b>wings like a dove!</b> David expresses his escapist feelings. <a ref='Psalms 55:9'>55:9</a> <b>divide their tongues.</b> Perhaps this is an allusion to the Tower of Babel, where God destroyed the force of the movement against Him by multiplying languages (cf. <a ref='Genesis 11:5–9'>Ge 11:5–9</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 55:15'>55:15</a> <b>go down alive to Sheol.</b> Since God had done this once with the enemies of Moses ( <a ref='Numbers 16:30'>Nu 16:30</a> ), David asks Him to perform the same judgment on his enemies. <a ref='Psalms 55:19'>55:19</a> <b>do not change.</b> David’s enemies were too set in their ways and too secure to pay any attention to God. <a ref='Psalms 55:20'>55:20</a> <b>violated his covenant.</b> This enemy had broken a treaty in his treachery, even against his allies. <a ref='Psalms 55:21'>55:21</a> <b>his heart was war.</b> Though the traitor talked peace, his intention was war. <a ref='Psalms 55:22'>55:22</a> <b>Cast your burden upon Yahweh.</b> The word for “burden” implies one’s circumstances, one’s lot. The psalmist promises that Yahweh will uphold the believer in the struggles of life. <a ref='Psalms 55:23'>55:23</a> <b>the pit of corruption.</b> Compare the unusual death of Absalom ( <a ref='2 Samuel 18:9–15'>2Sa 18:9–15</a> ) and the suicide of Ahithophel ( <a ref='2 Samuel 17:23'>2Sa 17:23</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 56:1–13'>56:1–13</a> This psalm, apparently written when David had been endangered by the Philistines ( <a ref='1 Samuel 21:10–15'>1Sa 21:10–15</a> ), expresses the kind of confidence in Yahweh that believers should exude when they find themselves in terrifying circumstances. David’s natural reaction was to panic (vv. <a ref='Psalms 56:3–4'>3–4</a> , <a ref='Psalms 56:11'>11</a> ).

Though David finds himself hiding from Saul (see Title), he knows that his real refuge is not in the walls of the cave (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 22:1'>1Sa 22:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 24:3'>24:3</a> ), but in the shadow of God’s wings.

In the end, the psalmist is certain that God will act with ultimate justice. I. The Indictment of Unjust Leaders ( <a ref='Psalms 58:1–5'>58:1–5</a> ) II.

The psalm is a mixture of prayers, unfavorable descriptions of the adversary, imprecations, and praise to God. Though written when David was king of Israel, the psalm recalls an earlier time of anguish when Saul sought to kill David ( <a ref='1 Samuel 19:11'>1Sa 19:11</a> ). Ultimately David’s strong confidence in God’s sovereignty transforms the lament into a song of assurance. I. A Plea for God’s Deliverance ( <a ref='Psalms 59:1–15'>59:1–15</a> ) II. Praise for God’s Defense ( <a ref='Psalms 59:16–17'>59:16–17</a> ) <a ref='Ps 59'>59:Title</a> <b>Al-tashheth.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Ps 57'>Ps 57:Title</a> .</i> <b>Mikhtam.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Ps 16'>Ps 16:Title</a> .</i> <b>Saul sent</b> men <b>… to put him to death.</b> The setting for the psalm is <a ref='1 Samuel 19:11'>1Sa 19:11</a> .

This phrase and “my people” in v. <a ref='Psalms 59:11'>11</a> imply that this psalm was written several years after the event when David was king and involved in international affairs. David wrote his psalms as a prophet under the superintendence of the Holy Spirit ( <a ref='2 Samuel 23:2'>2Sa 23:2</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 59:11'>59:11</a> <b>my people will forget.</b> The psalmist thinks that if Yahweh were to destroy the wicked too quickly, the lesson of God’s hatred of evil might not be impressed on the minds of the people. <a ref='Psalms 60:1–12'>60:1–12</a> This psalm is a national lament written after the unexpected military setback alluded to in <a ref='2 Samuel 8:13'>2Sa 8:13</a> and <a ref='1 Chronicles 18:12'>1Chr 18:12</a> . While David and the main part of his army were fighting in the northern part of the country, one of Israel’s other neighboring enemies, Edom, successfully attacked the southern part of Judah. David ultimately prevailed in victory. The psalm expresses the feelings of a people shocked and confused by a tragedy which suggested that God had abandoned them. Verses <a ref='Psalms 60:5–12'>5–12</a> are essentially repeated in <a ref='Psalms 108:6–13'>Ps 108:6–13</a> . I. The People’s Contemplation of Abandonment ( <a ref='Psalms 60:1–5'>60:1–5</a> ) II. Yahweh’s Control over the Nations ( <a ref='Psalms 60:6–8'>60:6–8</a> ) III. The People’s Confidence in God ( <a ref='Psalms 60:9–12'>60:9–12</a> ) <a ref='Ps 60'>60:Title</a> <b>Joab … smote twelve thousand.</b> Yahweh soon rewarded their confidence in Him, enabling the armies of Israel to slaughter the Edomites. <a ref='Psalms 60:2'>60:2</a> <b>land quake.</b> Earthquake imagery is used to illustrate that what appears secure sometimes is not. <a ref='Psalms 60:3'>60:3</a> <b>wine … that causes reeling.</b> This metaphor compares the impact of wine on the mind with the confusion which comes from a bewildering event in life. <a ref='Psalms 60:4'>60:4</a> <b>banner.</b> God and His truth serve as a rallying point for the perplexed people. <a ref='Psalms 60:5'>60:5</a> <b>beloved.</b> Beloved refers to God’s beloved people ruled over by David. <a ref='Psalms 60:6'>60:6</a> <b>Shechem … Succoth.</b> These are two territories on opposite sides of the Jordan, occupied by Israel. Jacob had settled in Succoth (east of the Jordan) when he returned from his sojourn with Laban (cf. <a ref='Genesis 33:17'>Ge 33:17</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 60:7'>60:7</a> <b>Gilead … Ephraim.</b> All of these key geographical locations in Israel ultimately belonged to God, who was more interested in their welfare than anyone else. <b>helmet.</b> Ephraim was the primary source of defense to the north of Israel. <b>scepter.</b> Judah was the tribe which was to govern Israel, from which David and his descendants came. <a ref='Psalms 60:8'>60:8</a> <b>Moab … Edom … Philistia.</b> The 3 principal enemies surrounding Israel to the northeast, southeast, and west, respectively. <b>Moab is My washbowl.</b> The psalmist pictures Moab as a humble, menial servant to God, either being or bringing a washbasin for His use. <b>Over Edom … shoe.</b> The picture is that of a man entering his house and throwing his shoes to his servant. Edom, like Moab, was a servant under God’s sovereign control. <b>Make a loud shout, O Philistia.</b> The difficult translation has two possibilities: 1) Philistia shouts its submission to God or 2) God shouts over Philistia in victory. Either one exalts God as victor/ruler. <a ref='Psalms 60:12'>60:12</a> <b>Through God … valiantly.</b> The nation relearned the truth that only God gives victory. <a ref='Psalms 61:1–8'>61:1–8</a> David may have written this wonderful psalm when his own son, Absalom, temporarily drove him away from his throne in Israel ( <a ref='2Sa 15-18'>2Sa 15–18</a> ). The psalm is rich in metaphors and references to God’s covenants with Israel. David once again demonstrates a godly response to overwhelming and depressing developments in life. I.

The phrase also hints at feelings of estrangement from God. <b>my heart is faint.</b> David’s hope and courage were failing. <b>the rock that is higher.</b> David expresses his disregard of personal autonomy and his reliance on his God in this metaphor for refuge. <a ref='Psalms 61:3'>61:3</a> <b>tower of strength.</b> One of 4 figures of speech in vv. <a ref='Psalms 61:3–4'>3–4</a> for security; the strong towers stabilized the city walls and served as places of defense and refuge. <a ref='Psalms 61:5'>61:5</a> <b>inheritance.</b> Refers to the benefits, including life in the Promised Land (cf. <a ref='De 28-30'>Dt 28–30</a> ), of participating in a covenant with God. <a ref='Psalms 61:6'>61:6</a> <b>add days to the king’s life.</b> In the immediate context, David prays for himself in his struggle with Absalom. Beyond this, here is a prayer for the continuity of the divinely established monarchy. Because he realized that one of his descendants would be the Messiah, David sometimes does not distinguish himself from the messianic dynasty. <a ref='Psalms 61:7'>61:7</a> <b>forever.</b> The Davidic Covenant guaranteed that on the basis of God’s merciful and faithful dealings with David and the nation, David’s descendants would rule on the throne of Israel forever (cf. <a ref='2Sa 7'>2Sa 7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 40:11'>Pss 40:11</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:4'>89:4</a> , <a ref='Psalms 89:33–37'>33–37</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 61:8'>61:8</a> <b>pay my vows day by day.</b> As a regular means of expressing thanksgiving for prayers answered, the psalmist promised daily obedience to his Lord (cf. <a ref='Psalms 56:12'>Ps 56:12</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 62:1–12'>62:1–12</a> Whether Absalom’s rebellion is the setting or not ( <a ref='2Sa 15-18'>2Sa 15–18</a> ), David writes this psalm while facing treason from someone. David faces the problem of his adversaries forthrightly (vv. <a ref='Psalms 62:3–4'>3–4</a> ), but his thoughts focus primarily on God (cf. <a ref='Philippians 4:4–13'>Php 4:4–13</a> ). I.

The psalm was written while David was in the Judean wilderness, either during his flight from Saul ( <a ref='1Sa 23'>1Sa 23</a> ), or more likely from Absalom ( <a ref='2Sa 15'>2Sa 15</a> ; cf. <a ref='Psalms 63:11'>63:11</a> “the king”). David writes from the perspective of these tenses: I. Present—Seeking God’s Presence ( <a ref='Psalms 63:1–5'>63:1–5</a> ) II. Past—Remembering God’s Power ( <a ref='Psalms 63:6–8'>63:6–8</a> ) III. Future—Anticipating God’s Judgment ( <a ref='Psalms 63:9–11'>63:9–11</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 63:1'>63:1</a> <b>I shall seek You earnestly.</b> Eagerness to be with Yahweh in every situation is more in view than the time of day. <b>My soul thirsts.</b> David longs for God’s presence like a wanderer in a desert longs for water. <b>In a dry and weary land.</b> David writes this psalm while hiding in the wilderness of Judea, but longing to be back worshiping in Jerusalem. <a ref='Psalms 63:3'>63:3</a> <b>better than life.</b> God’s covenant love is more valuable to David than life itself (cf. <a ref='Philippians 1:21'>Php 1:21</a> ; <a ref='Acts 20:24'>Ac 20:24</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 63:4'>63:4</a> <b>lift up my hands.</b> As an OT posture of prayer, the upheld hands pictured both the ascent of prayer and the readiness to receive every good gift which comes from God (cf. <a ref='James 1:17'>Jas 1:17</a> ). It was thus a posture of trust in God alone. <a ref='Psalms 63:5'>63:5</a> <b>fatness and richness.</b> A metaphor comparing the spiritual and emotional satisfaction of the divine presence with the satisfaction of rich banquet food. <a ref='Psalms 63:8'>63:8</a> <b>My soul clings to You.</b> In response to God’s repeated invitation to “hold fast” to Him ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:4'>Dt 4:4</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:20'>10:20</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 13:4'>13:4</a> ), the psalmist clings to God. This signifies David’s unfailing commitment to his Lord. <a ref='Psalms 63:9'>63:9</a> <b>into the depths of the earth.</b> A reference to the realm of the dead. <i>See note on <a ref='Ephesians 4:9'>Eph 4:9</a> .</i> <a ref='Psalms 63:10'>63:10</a> <b>foxes.</b> Scavengers, feasting on unburied bodies ( <i>see note on <a ref='Psalms 53:5'>Ps 53:5</a></i> ). <a ref='Psalms 63:11'>63:11</a> <b>who swears by Him.</b> The Mosaic Covenant instructed this practice expressing loyalty to the true God alone (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 6:13'>Dt 6:13</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 10:20'>10:20</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 8:31'>1Ki 8:31</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 12:16'>Jer 12:16</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 64:1–10'>64:1–10</a> This psalm begins with a vivid description of the devious ways of the wicked, especially their speech (vv. <a ref='Psalms 64:3–5'>3–5</a> , <a ref='Psalms 64:8'>8</a> ). Still, the psalmist does not fear that God will lose control of the situation. After seeing His justice at work, the righteous will be glad and trust all the more in Him ( <a ref='Psalms 64:10'>64:10</a> ). I. The Malevolent Ingenuity of the Wicked ( <a ref='Psalms 64:1–6'>64:1–6</a> ) II. The Memorable Reciprocation by Yahweh ( <a ref='Psalms 64:7–10'>64:7–10</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 64:1'>64:1</a> <b>Guard … from dread.</b> The psalmist recognized that the fear of an enemy can be as destructive as an actual assault. <a ref='Psalms 64:3'>64:3</a> <b>sharpened their tongue.</b> Their intent was to slander with their speech (cf. <a ref='Psalms 59:7'>Ps 59:7</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 64:4'>64:4</a> <b>from places of hiding.</b> Anonymously. <a ref='Psalms 64:5'>64:5</a> <b>Who can see them?</b> This was a question of brazen autonomy.

The setting is a celebration at the tabernacle, perhaps at Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the spring, or the Feast of Booths, or Tabernacles, in the fall. I. Praise for Spiritual Blessings ( <a ref='Psalms 65:1–5'>65:1–5</a> ) II.

Communal Hymn of Praise to God ( <a ref='Psalms 66:1–12'>66:1–12</a> ) A. For Future Glory ( <a ref='Psalms 66:1–4'>66:1–4</a> ) B. For Previous Faithfulness ( <a ref='Psalms 66:5–7'>66:5–7</a> ) C.

The OT writers considered the Red Sea crossing the ultimate demonstration of God’s power, as well as His care for Israel. <a ref='Psalms 66:9'>66:9</a> <b>feet to stumble.</b> God had prevented them from prematurely slipping into the realm of the dead. <a ref='Psalms 66:10'>66:10</a> <b>refined us as silver.</b> God had brought the nation through purifying trials. <a ref='Psalms 66:11'>66:11</a> <b>brought us into the net.</b> The psalmist speaks of a hunter’s net or snare as a metaphor for some extremely difficult situations into which God had brought Israel. <a ref='Psalms 66:12'>66:12</a> <b>ride over our heads.</b> A picture of a hostile army riding in victory over Israel’s defeated troops. <a ref='Psalms 66:13'>66:13</a> <b>pay You my vows.</b> Paying the vows is spelled out in the following verses as offering sacrifices of dedication which had been previously promised God (cf. <a ref='Le 1'>Lv 1</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 22:18'>22:18</a> , <a ref='Le 21'>21</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 56:12'>Pss 56:12</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 61:8'>61:8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 65:1'>65:1</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 67:1–7'>67:1–7</a> This brief psalm develops two optimistic themes: the need and result of God’s mercy, and the future universal worship of God. The psalm reflects the promise to Abraham that God would bless his descendants, and in Abraham, “all the families of the earth” ( <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> ). I.

It expresses a pride in Jehovah God for His care over His people and His majesty in the universe. The writing of this psalm may have come out of David’s jubilant restoration of the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 6:12–15'>2Sa 6:12–15</a> ). I.

David realizes that because he is hated by others, he may shortly be killed. Though he begs for rescue, and calls down curses on his enemies, he concludes the psalm with a high note of praise, with inferences concerning the coming messianic kingdom when all enemies of God’s people are dealt with swiftly and severely (cf. <a ref='Revelation 2:27'>Rev 2:27</a> ). Much of this psalm was applied to Christ by the NT writers. This psalm expresses the feelings of any believer who is being horribly ridiculed, but it uniquely refers to Christ. I. The Prayer of Desperation ( <a ref='Psalms 69:1–28'>69:1–28</a> ) A. The Description of His Situation ( <a ref='Psalms 69:1–3'>69:1–3</a> ) B.

Whenever God was dishonored he felt the pain, because he loved God so greatly. Jesus claimed for Himself this attitude, as indicated in <a ref='John 2:17'>Jn 2:17</a> ; <a ref='Romans 15:3'>Ro 15:3</a> . <a ref='Psalms 69:11'>69:11</a> <b>sackcloth.</b> David’s wearing of sackcloth, a symbol of grief, brought even more ridicule. <a ref='Psalms 69:12'>69:12</a> <b>dwell at the gate.</b> The highest in society, those who sat in the gate of a city, were usually governmental officials. Even their city leaders were gossiping about the psalmist. <b>the drunkards’ songs.</b> The dregs of society, the drunkards, ridiculed David in their raucous songs. <a ref='Psalms 69:15'>69:15</a> <b>pit shut its mouth.</b> The “pit” was another word for Sheol, the realm of the dead. The psalmist felt that death was imminent. <a ref='Psalms 69:21'>69:21</a> <b>gall … vinegar.</b> Gall was a poisonous herb. Here it serves as a metaphor for betrayal. Friends who should provide sustenance to the psalmist had turned against him. Gall in vinegar was actually offered to Christ while He was on the cross ( <a ref='Matthew 27:34'>Mt 27:34</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 69:22'>69:22</a> <b>table … become a snare.</b> A snare was a trap for birds. The psalmist prays that the plots of the wicked against him would backfire and destroy them instead. <a ref='Psalms 69:22–23'>69:22–23</a> Quoted in <a ref='Romans 11:9–10'>Ro 11:9–10</a> . <a ref='Psalms 69:25'>69:25</a> Quoted in <a ref='Acts 1:20'>Ac 1:20</a> with reference to Judas. <a ref='Psalms 69:26'>69:26</a> <b>him whom You … have struck down.</b> Those hostile to the psalmist were ridiculing him as one suffering from God’s chastisement. In its messianic application, the suffering of the Messiah was a part of God’s plan from eternity past (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 53:10'>Is 53:10</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 69:31'>69:31</a> <b>better than an ox … bull.</b> See <a ref='Psalms 51:16'>Ps 51:16</a> ; also <a ref='Hebrews 9:11–12'>Heb 9:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:9–12'>10:9–12</a> . <b>horns and hoofs.</b> Implies a grown animal, one that would be especially valuable. <a ref='Psalms 70:1–5'>70:1–5</a> This prayer for deliverance from one’s enemies is nearly identical to <a ref='Psalms 40:13–17'>Ps 40:13–17</a> . It substitutes “God” for “Yahweh” in vv. <a ref='Psalms 70:1'>1</a> , <a ref='Psalms 70:4–5'>4–5</a> . <a ref='Psalms 71:1–24'>71:1–24</a> One of the features of the psalms is that they meet the circumstances of life. This psalm to God expresses the concerns of old age. At a time in his life when he thinks he should be exempt from certain kinds of troubles, he once again is personally attacked. Though his enemies conclude that God has abandoned him, the psalmist is confident that God will remain faithful. I. Confidence in God Stated ( <a ref='Psalms 71:1–8'>71:1–8</a> ) II. Confidence in God Practiced in Prayer ( <a ref='Psalms 71:9–13'>71:9–13</a> ) III. Confidence in God Vindicated ( <a ref='Psalms 71:14–24'>71:14–24</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 71:3'>71:3</a> <b>continually.</b> <a ref='Psalms 71:1–3'>Psalm 71:1–3</a> is almost the same as <a ref='Psalms 31:1–3'>Ps 31:1–3a</a> . One difference, however, is the word “continually,” which the elderly person writing this psalm wants to emphasize. God has “continually” been faithful (cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 71:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Psalms 71:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 71:7'>71:7</a> <b>a marvel.</b> A reference to his trials. People are amazed at this person’s life, some interpreting his trials as God’s care, and others as God’s punishment. <a ref='Psalms 71:15'>71:15</a> <b>the sum</b> of them <b>.</b> The blessings of God’s salvation and righteousness are innumerable. <a ref='Psalms 71:20'>71:20</a> <b>from the depths of the earth.</b> Not actual resurrection, but rescue from near-death conditions and renewal of life’s strength and meaning. <a ref='Psalms 72:1–20'>72:1–20</a> This is a Coronation Psalm, dedicated to the prosperity of Solomon at the beginning of his reign ( <a ref='1Ki 2'>1Ki 2</a> ). No NT writer applies any of the psalm to Christ. Still, since the Davidic kings and the Messiah’s rule occasionally merge into each other in the OT literature, the messianic inferences here ought not to be missed (vv. <a ref='Psalms 72:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Psalms 72:17'>17</a> ; cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:1–5'>Is 11:1–5</a> ; <a ref='Is 60-62'>60–62</a> ). This psalm describes a reign when God, the king, nature, all classes of society, and foreign nations all live together in harmony. I. A Just Reign ( <a ref='Psalms 72:1–4'>72:1–4</a> ) II. A Universal Reign ( <a ref='Psalms 72:5–11'>72:5–11</a> ) III. A Compassionate Reign ( <a ref='Psalms 72:12–14'>72:12–14</a> ) IV. A Prosperous Reign ( <a ref='Psalms 72:15–17'>72:15–17</a> ) V. A Glorious Reign ( <a ref='Psalms 72:18–20'>72:18–20</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 72:1'>72:1</a> <b>Your judgments.</b> A prayer that the king would faithfully mediate God’s justice on the nation (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:18–20'>Dt 17:18–20</a> ). <b>the king’s son.</b> A reference primarily to Solomon, emphasizing his bond with the Davidic dynasty; but it also anticipates the Messiah’s reign as the culmination of the Davidic Covenant (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 7:12–13'>2Sa 7:12–13</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 2:1–12'>Ps 2:1–12</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 72:3'>72:3</a> <b>mountains … peace.</b> When the king rules with justice and compassion, the earth itself radiates well-being. <a ref='Psalms 72:7'>72:7</a> <b>until the moon is no more.</b> Primarily referring to the length of the Davidic dynasty, and possibly also specifically to the messianic reign ( <a ref='2 Samuel 7:16'>2Sa 7:16</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:3–4'>Ps 89:3–4</a> , <a ref='Psalms 89:29'>29</a> , <a ref='Psalms 89:36–37'>36–37</a> ; <a ref='Luke 1:30–33'>Lk 1:30–33</a> ). Jeremiah also makes the same kind of observation (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 33:23–26'>Jer 33:23–26</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 72:8'>72:8</a> <b>the River.</b> Israel’s boundaries were to extend to the River Euphrates (cf. <a ref='Exodus 23:31'>Ex 23:31</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 4:21'>1Ki 4:21</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:25'>Ps 89:25</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 72:10'>72:10</a> <b>Tarshish … Seba.</b> Countries near and far which brought tribute to Solomon (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 4:21'>1Ki 4:21</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 10:1'>10:1</a> , <a ref='1 Kings 10:23–24'>23–24</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 60:4–7'>Is 60:4–7</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 6:20'>Jer 6:20</a> ). Tarshish is probably in Spain; Sheba, a kingdom in southern Arabia (modern Yemen); and Seba, a north African nation. <a ref='Psalms 72:20'>72:20</a> <b>are completed.</b> Asaph’s psalms immediately follow after this ( <a ref='Ps 73-83'>Pss 73–83</a> ), though David did author some of the psalms included later in the collection (e.g., <a ref='Ps 86'>Pss 86</a> , <a ref='Ps 101'>101</a> , <a ref='Ps 103'>103</a> ). This closes Book II ( <a ref='Ps 42-72'>Pss 42–72</a> ) of the Psalms. <a ref='Psalms 73:1–28'>73:1–28</a> This psalm illustrates the results of allowing one’s faith in God to be buried under self-pity. The psalmist became depressed when he contrasted the seeming prosperity of the wicked with the difficulties of living a righteous life. Beginning in v. <a ref='Psalms 73:15'>15</a> , however, his attitude changes completely. He looks at life from the perspective of being under the control of a sovereign, holy God, and concludes that it is the wicked, not the righteous, who have blundered. I. Perplexity Over the Prosperity of the Wicked ( <a ref='Psalms 73:1–14'>73:1–14</a> ) A. Their Prosperity ( <a ref='Psalms 73:1–5'>73:1–5</a> ) B. Their Pride ( <a ref='Psalms 73:6–9'>73:6–9</a> ) C.

His Guidance ( <a ref='Psalms 73:21–28'>73:21–28</a> ) <a ref='Ps 73'>73:Title</a> <b>Asaph.</b> Asaph was a Levite who led one of the temple choirs ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 15:19'>1Chr 15:19</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 25:1–2'>25:1–2</a> ). His name is identified with <a ref='Ps 73-83'>Ps 73–83</a> , and also <a ref='Ps 50'>Ps 50</a> ( <i>see note on <a ref='Ps 50'>50:Title</a></i> ).

It was bad enough that Israel’s enemies had destroyed the temple (cf. <a ref='2Ki 25'>2Ki 25</a> ). But even worse, it seemed to the psalmist that God had abandoned them. In this prayer he reminds God of His bond with Israel, His past supernatural deeds in the protection of Israel, and begs God to save His covenant nation now (cf. <a ref='Ps 137'>Ps 137</a> and Lamentations).

Thus this title may mean that this psalm was written by or sung by a later Asaph choir ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Ps 50'>Pss 50</a> , <a ref='Ps 73'>73:Title</a></i> ). <a ref='Psalms 74:2'>74:2</a> <b>tribe of Your inheritance.</b> The psalmist laments that even though God possessed Israel, He had not protected it. <a ref='Psalms 74:3'>74:3</a> <b>Lift up Your steps.</b> An anthropomorphism meaning to hurry to come to examine the rubble. <a ref='Psalms 74:4'>74:4</a> <b>their own signs for signs.</b> The ravagers had set up their military and pagan religious banners in God’s temple. <a ref='Psalms 74:5'>74:5</a> <b>lifts up</b> An <b>axe.</b> Like lumberjacks surrounded by trees, the enemy had furiously destroyed everything in sight in the temple of God. <a ref='Psalms 74:8'>74:8</a> <b>the meeting places.</b> God allowed only one sanctuary and during Josiah’s revival, the high places had been destroyed (cf. <a ref='2Ki 22-23'>2Ki 22–23</a> ).

He gives stability to earthly life, and He will judge the wicked at the appropriate time. Structurally, the psalm revolves around 3 metaphors: pillars of the earth (v. <a ref='Psalms 75:3'>3</a> ); horns (vv. <a ref='Psalms 75:5–6'>5–6</a> , <a ref='Psalms 75:10'>10</a> ); and God’s cup of wrath (v. <a ref='Psalms 75:8'>8</a> ).

The history of God’s supernatural interventions on behalf of His people demonstrated that God was personally immanent. But OT saints did not have the fullness from permanent, personal indwelling of the Holy Spirit (cf. <a ref='John 14:1'>Jn 14:1</a> , <a ref='John 14:16–17'>16–17</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:16'>1Co 3:16</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:19'>6:19</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 75:3'>75:3</a> <b>I … firmly set its pillars.</b> In uncertain times, God stabilizes societies through His common grace. <a ref='Psalms 75:4'>75:4</a> <b>Do not raise up the horn.</b> The horn symbolized an animal’s or human’s strength and majesty (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:17'>Dt 33:17</a> ; <a ref='Amos 6:13'>Am 6:13</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 1:18–21'>Zec 1:18–21</a> ). Raising up the horn apparently described a stubborn animal who kept itself from entering a yoke by holding its head up as high as possible. The phrase thus symbolized insolence or rebellion. <a ref='Psalms 75:8'>75:8</a> <b>cup.</b> The cup of wrath describes God’s judgment which He forces down the throats of the wicked (cf. <a ref='Job 21:20'>Job 21:20</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 51:17'>Is 51:17</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 25:15–29'>Jer 25:15–29</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 20:22'>Mt 20:22</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 26:39'>26:39</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 75:10'>75:10</a> <b>horns … cut off.</b> To cut off the horns of the wicked would be to humble them (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 75:4'>4</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 76:1–12'>76:1–12</a> This psalm teaches that God is willing to use His great power for His people. Some commentators, including the editors of the LXX, have suggested that this psalm was written to celebrate the destruction of Sennacherib’s Assyrian army in 701 BC, as well as the subsequent assassination of Sennacherib himself (vv. <a ref='Psalms 76:5–6'>5–6</a> ; cf. <a ref='2Ki 18-19'>2Ki 18–19</a> ; <a ref='Is 36-37'>Is 36–37</a> ). The psalm also includes eschatological overtones (especially vv. <a ref='Psalms 76:8–12'>8–12</a> ), when Jehovah will defeat His enemies and bring them into judgment. I.

The psalmist does not explain the cause of his despair, but he was definitely locked into gloom. When he thought about God, it only caused him to complain bitterly. But beginning in v. <a ref='Psalms 77:10'>10</a> , the psalmist’s mood starts to change because he commits himself to focusing on God’s goodness and past acts of deliverance.

If the children learn well the theological interpretation of their nation’s history, hopefully they would “not be like their fathers” (v. <a ref='Psalms 78:8'>8</a> ).

Also, David, their king, and his royal descendants were from this tribe. <a ref='Psalms 79:1–13'>79:1–13</a> The historical basis for this lament psalm was probably Nebuchadnezzar’s destruction of the temple in 586 BC (cf. <a ref='Ps 74'>Ps 74</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 25:8–21'>2Ki 25:8–21</a> ; <a ref='La 1-5'>Lam 1–5</a> ). The psalm contains prayer for the nation’s spiritual needs, curses against the enemies of God’s people, and praises in anticipation of God’s actions. The psalm helps the believer express his anguish in a disaster when it seems as though God is aloof. I. The Lamentation Over the National Disaster ( <a ref='Psalms 79:1–4'>79:1–4</a> ) II.

The psalmist recognized that God’s people had removed themselves through apostasy from the blessings of the Mosaic Covenant. So he begs God to act and to restore His people into covenant blessings (vv. <a ref='Psalms 80:3'>3</a> , <a ref='Psalms 80:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Psalms 80:14'>14</a> , <a ref='Psalms 80:19'>19</a> ).

After the call to worship (vv. <a ref='Psalms 81:1–5'>1–5</a> ), the psalm presents a message from God in the first person (vv. <a ref='Psalms 81:6–16'>6–16</a> ). This oracle pleads with Israel to “listen” to Him (v. <a ref='Psalms 81:13'>13</a> ), so that He might pour out on the nation the blessings of the covenant. I.

The Feast of Tabernacles praised God for His care in the wilderness wanderings, and also pointed to the coming kingdom ( <a ref='Matthew 17:1–4'>Mt 17:1–4</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 81:5'>81:5</a> <b>language … did not know.</b> Either the psalmist heard a message, the meaning of which he did not grasp, in which case this message is presented as an oracle in the following verses; or, the psalmist is referring to the Egyptian language, which the Jews did not know. <a ref='Psalms 81:6'>81:6</a> <b>hands … freed … basket.</b> The Israelites in Egypt were forced to carry bricks and clay in baskets. <a ref='Psalms 81:7'>81:7</a> <b>hiding place of thunder.</b> Probably a reference to God’s presence on Mt.

The psalmist pictures God standing in the assembly of earthly leaders, to whom He has delegated authority, and condemning their injustices. The final prayer of the psalmist (v. <a ref='Psalms 82:8'>8</a> ) is that God Himself will take direct control of the affairs of this world. I.

Edom descended from Esau and lived southeast of Israel. The Ishmaelites, descendants from Abraham and Hagar, were Bedouin tribes.

The pilgrim focuses his attention especially on the thought of being in the very presence of the Lord God. The NT believer-priest, in an even greater way, can come into the presence of Yahweh (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 4:16'>Heb 4:16</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:19–22'>10:19–22</a> ). I.

The last third of the psalm reflects the psalmist’s chagrin that the nation had been ravaged and the Davidic monarchy had apparently come to a disgraceful end. To his credit, the psalmist refuses to explain away his theology, but instead keeps the tension, hopefully to be resolved at a later time with the promised reestablishment of an earthly kingdom under one of David’s descendants (cf. <a ref='Ps 110'>Pss 110</a> , <a ref='Ps 132'>132</a> ).

The covenant was in the form of a royal grant covenant as God, the Great King, chose David as His servant king. In this type of covenant, the person with whom Yahweh established the covenant could violate the terms of the covenant and Yahweh would still be obligated to maintain the covenant. <a ref='Psalms 89:4'>89:4</a> <b>seed forever … throne.</b> The covenant with David was extended to his descendants. The throne promise guaranteed that the rightful heir to the throne would always be a descendant of David (cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 89:29'>29</a> , <a ref='Psalms 89:36'>36</a> ; see also <a ref='2 Samuel 7:13'>2Sa 7:13</a> , <a ref='2 Samuel 7:16'>16</a> , <a ref='2 Samuel 7:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Luke 1:31–33'>Lk 1:31–33</a> ).

However, in a royal grant covenant, a chosen person could be elevated to the level of firstborn sonship and thus have title to a perpetual gift involving dynastic succession (cf. <a ref='Psalms 2:7'>Ps 2:7</a> ). Though not actually the first, Israel was considered the firstborn among nations ( <a ref='Exodus 4:22'>Ex 4:22</a> ); Ephraim the younger was treated as the firstborn ( <a ref='Genesis 48:13–20'>Ge 48:13–20</a> ); and David was the firstborn among kings. In this latter sense of prominent favor, Christ can be called the firstborn over all creation ( <a ref='Colossians 1:15'>Col 1:15</a> ), in that He is given the preeminence over all created beings. <a ref='Psalms 89:32'>89:32</a> <b>rod … striking.</b> The rod was an instrument for inflicting wounds, and the stripes were marks left by such a flogging. God’s warning reflects His knowledge of the evident potential for disobedience among the descendants of David (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 7:14'>2Sa 7:14</a> ). In the lifetime of David’s grandsons, for example, the kingdom was split with the 10 northern tribes leaving the rulership of the Davidic line (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31'>Jer 31:31</a> and <a ref='Ezekiel 37:16–17'>Eze 37:16–17</a> for the future reunification of the 12 tribes). <a ref='Psalms 89:33'>89:33</a> <b>My lovingkindness.</b> Though Yahweh might have to severely discipline David’s descendants, He would never remove His covenant from this family (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 7:15'>2Sa 7:15</a> ). Thus the covenant could be conditional in any one or more generations and yet be unconditional in its final outcome (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:24–28'>Eze 37:24–28</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 89:37'>89:37</a> <b>witness in the sky is faithful.</b> God’s covenant with David regarding his descendants was as certain as the establishment of the sun (v. <a ref='Psalms 89:36'>36</a> ) and the moon in the heavens (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 33:14–26'>Jer 33:14–26</a> ). The promise involved a kingdom “in the earth” ( <a ref='Jeremiah 33:15'>Jer 33:15</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 89:39'>89:39</a> <b>spurned the covenant.</b> The Hebrew word behind “spurned” is rare, and it may better be translated “disdained.” It seemed to the psalmist that the condition of Israel indicated that God was neglecting His covenant with David (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:1–14'>Eze 37:1–14</a> ). <b>profaned his crown.</b> This depicts a serious insult to the dynasty because it is of divine origin. <a ref='Psalms 89:40–45'>89:40–45</a> The ruin is depicted in several images: left with broken hedges, thus defenseless; a stronghold whose ruins invite invaders; a weakling plundered by all his enemies; a soldier with a useless sword; and a youth prematurely old. <a ref='Psalms 89:45'>89:45</a> <b>shortened the days of his youth.</b> This is a figure for the relative brevity of the Davidic dynasty. The dynasty was cut off in its youth. <a ref='Psalms 89:46'>89:46</a> <b>hide Yourself forever?</b> By God’s seeming refusal to answer prayer and restore the Davidic kingship, it seemed as though God was hiding Himself. Of course, the discipline of disobedient kings had been foretold (v. <a ref='Psalms 89:32'>32</a> ). According to the prophets, God would eventually restore Israel and the Davidic throne in an earthly kingdom (cf. <a ref='Hosea 3:4–5'>Hos 3:4–5</a> ). Never in the OT is there a sense that this Davidic promise would be fulfilled by Christ with a spiritual and heavenly reign. <a ref='Psalms 89:47'>89:47</a> The prosperity of the Davidic kingdom is linked to the welfare of all people (cf. <a ref='Psalms 72:17'>Ps 72:17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 9:7'>Is 9:7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:1–10'>11:1–10</a> ). If the kingdom fails, who can survive? (v. <a ref='Psalms 89:48'>48</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 89:49–51'>89:49–51</a> Here is a final plea for God to come to the help of His people, so as to avoid reproach (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 37:17–35'>Is 37:17–35</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 89:52'>89:52</a> <b>Blessed be Yahweh.</b> This blessing, indicating returning confidence, closes not only <a ref='Ps 89'>Ps 89</a> , but all of Book III ( <a ref='Ps 73-89'>Pss 73–89</a> ) of the Psalms. <a ref='Psalms 90:1–17'>90:1–17</a> The thrust of this magnificent prayer is to ask God to have mercy on frail human beings living in a sin-cursed universe. Moses begins the psalm with a reflection on God’s eternality, then expresses his somber thoughts about the sorrows and brevity of life in their relationship to God’s anger, and concludes with a plea that God would enable His people to live a significant life. The psalm seems to have been composed as the older generation of Israelites who had left Egypt were dying off in the wilderness ( <a ref='Nu 14'>Nu 14</a> ). I.

The Plea for God’s Mercy ( <a ref='Psalms 90:13–17'>90:13–17</a> ) <a ref='Ps 90'>90:Title</a> <b>Moses, the man of God.</b> Moses the prophet ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:15–22'>Dt 18:15–22</a> ) was unique in that Yahweh knew him “face to face” ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:10–12'>Dt 34:10–12</a> ). “Man of God” ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:1'>Dt 33:1</a> ) is a technical term used over 70 times in the OT, always referring to one who spoke for God. It is used of Timothy in the NT ( <a ref='1 Timothy 6:11'>1Ti 6:11</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 3:17'>2Ti 3:17</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 90:1'>90:1</a> <b>our dwelling place.</b> God is our sanctuary for protection, sustenance, and stability (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:27'>Dt 33:27</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 91:9'>Ps 91:9</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 90:2'>90:2</a> <b>from everlasting to everlasting.</b> God’s nature is without beginning or end, free from all succession of time, and contains in itself the cause of time (cf. <a ref='Psalms 102:27'>Ps 102:27</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 41:4'>Is 41:4</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 2:7'>1Co 2:7</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:4'>Eph 1:4</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 6:16'>1Ti 6:16</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 1:8'>Rev 1:8</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 90:3'>90:3</a> <b>You turn man back into dust.</b> Though different from the “dust” of <a ref='Genesis 3:19'>Ge 3:19</a> , this phrase is no doubt a reference to that passage. Humanity lives under a sovereign decree of death and cannot escape it. <a ref='Psalms 90:4'>90:4</a> <b>a watch in the night.</b> A “watch” was a 4-hour period of time (cf. <a ref='Exodus 14:24'>Ex 14:24</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 2:19'>Lam 2:19</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 3:8'>2Pe 3:8</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 90:5'>90:5</a> <b>like a flood.</b> Humankind is snatched from the earth as though it were being swept away by floodwaters. <b>they fall asleep.</b> Humanity lives its existence as though asleep or in a coma. People are insensitive to the brevity of life and the reality of God’s wrath. <a ref='Psalms 90:7'>90:7</a> <b>consumed by Your anger.</b> The physical bodies of the human race wear out by the effects of God’s judgment on sin in the universe (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 4:25–28'>Dt 4:25–28</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:16–17'>11:16–17</a> ). Death is by sin ( <a ref='Romans 5:12'>Ro 5:12</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 90:8'>90:8</a> <b>the light of Your presence.</b> All sin is in clear view to the “face” of God. <a ref='Psalms 90:9'>90:9</a> <b>like a sigh.</b> After struggling through his life of afflictions and troubles, a man’s life ends with a moan of woe and weariness. <a ref='Psalms 90:10'>90:10</a> <b>seventy years … eighty years.</b> Though Moses lived to be 120 years old, and his “eye was not dim, nor his vigor abated” ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:7'>Dt 34:7</a> ), human life was usually more brief and lived under the anger of God. Because of this certain and speedy end, life is sad. <a ref='Psalms 90:11'>90:11</a> <b>Your fury … fear … due You?</b> Instead of explaining away life’s curses, a wise person will recognize God’s wrath toward sin as the ultimate cause of all afflictions and consequently learn to fear God. <a ref='Psalms 90:12'>90:12</a> <b>number our days.</b> Evaluate the use of time in light of the brevity of life. <b>heart of wisdom.</b> Wisdom repudiates autonomy and focuses on Yahweh’s sovereignty and revelation. <a ref='Psalms 90:14'>90:14</a> <b>Your lovingkindness.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Psalms 85:7'>Ps 85:7</a> .</i> <a ref='Psalms 90:15'>90:15</a> <b>glad … afflicted us.</b> A prayer that one’s days of joy would equal his days of distress. <a ref='Psalms 90:17'>90:17</a> <b>the favor of Yahweh.</b> Yahweh’s favor implies His delight and approval. <b>establish the work of our hands.</b> By God’s mercy and grace, one’s life can have value, significance, and meaning (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:58'>1Co 15:58</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 91:1–16'>91:1–16</a> This psalm describes God’s ongoing sovereign protection of His people from the ever-present dangers and terrors which surround humanity. The original setting may be that of an army about to go to battle. Most of the terrors mentioned in this psalm are left undefined, no doubt intentionally, so that no kind of danger is omitted from application. Believers in every age can read this psalm to learn that nothing can harm a child of God unless Yahweh permits it. However, in light of the many references in the Psalms to the future messianic kingdom (cf. especially <a ref='Ps 96-100'>Pss 96–100</a> ), this psalm must be read as being literally fulfilled then.

The prophets also promise it to God’s people in the future messianic kingdom (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 65:17–23'>Is 65:17–23</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 92:1–15'>92:1–15</a> This psalm expresses the exuberance of the psalmist as he recognizes that God is merciful in salvation, great in His works of creation, just in His dealings with the wicked, and faithful in prospering His children.

During this feast, the people of Israel lived in booths, remembering God’s provisions for them in the wilderness. After a call to worship ( <a ref='Psalms 95:1–7'>95:1–7a</a> ), a prophecy in the voice of the Holy Spirit Himself (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 3:7'>Heb 3:7</a> ) breaks in and reminds the people of the dangers of rebellion and tempting God.

The writer to the Hebrews applies the principle of this event to his readers, suggesting that their inclination to doubt Yahweh and return to Judaism was parallel with their fathers’ inclination to doubt Yahweh and go back to Egypt. <a ref='Psalms 95:10'>95:10</a> <b>wander in their heart.</b> Their wanderings in the desert were the outworking of straying hearts. <a ref='Psalms 95:11'>95:11</a> <b>My rest.</b> The “rest” was originally the Promised Land (i.e., Canaan), where the people came at the end of Israel’s 40-year journey in the wilderness.

Possibly, this psalm was used later at the coronations of future kings over Israel.

God responded with judgment ( <a ref='Numbers 14:11–38'>Nu 14:11–38</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 106:24'>106:24</a> <b>the pleasant land.</b> A term used of the Land God promised to Abraham for the nation Israel (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 3:19'>Jer 3:19</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 7:14'>Zec 7:14</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 106:28–31'>106:28–31</a> This scene recounts Israel’s encounter with the prophet Balaam who, on behalf of Balak, King of Moab, tried to curse Israel but was prevented from doing so by God (cf. <a ref='Nu 22-24'>Nu 22–24</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:4'>Dt 23:4</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 24:9–10'>Jos 24:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 13:2'>Ne 13:2</a> ). Having failed, Balaam advised Balak to entice Israel with immorality and idolatry (cf. <a ref='Numbers 31:16'>Nu 31:16</a> with <a ref='Numbers 25:1'>25:1</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 2:15'>2Pe 2:15</a> ; <a ref='Jude 1:11'>Jd 11</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 2:14'>Rev 2:14</a> ). Israel sinned and God judged ( <a ref='Numbers 25:1–13'>Nu 25:1–13</a> ). Balaam was later slain by Israel (cf. <a ref='Joshua 13:22'>Jos 13:22</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 106:28'>106:28</a> <b>Baal-peor.</b> Refers to Baal, a god of the Moabites, whose worship occurred at the location of the mountain called Peor (cf. <a ref='Numbers 23:28'>Nu 23:28</a> ). <b>sacrifices</b> offered to <b>the dead.</b> This most likely refers to sacrifices made to lifeless idols (cf. <a ref='1 Thessalonians 1:9'>1Th 1:9</a> ). Israel should have been worshiping “the living God” (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 5:26'>Dt 5:26</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 17:26'>1Sa 17:26</a> , <a ref='1 Samuel 17:36'>36</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 42:2'>Pss 42:2</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 84:2'>84:2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 10:3–10'>Jer 10:3–10</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 6:20'>Da 6:20</a> , <a ref='Daniel 6:26'>26</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 106:30'>106:30</a> <b>Phinehas.</b> The son of Eleazar, son of Aaron (cf. <a ref='Numbers 25:7'>Nu 25:7</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 106:31'>106:31</a> <b>counted to him for righteousness.</b> This was a just and rewardable action, evidencing faith in God. As with Abraham (cf. <a ref='Genesis 15:6'>Ge 15:6</a> and <a ref='Romans 4:3'>Ro 4:3</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:6'>Ga 3:6</a> ; <a ref='James 2:23'>Jas 2:23</a> ), so it was also with Phinehas. The everlasting covenant of perpetual priesthood through Aaron, from the house of Levi, was first made by God in <a ref='Leviticus 24:8–9'>Lv 24:8–9</a> (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 33:17–22'>Jer 33:17–22</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 2:4–8'>Mal 2:4–8</a> ). This covenant was reaffirmed in <a ref='Numbers 18:8'>Nu 18:8</a> , <a ref='Numbers 18:19'>19</a> . In this text, the covenant is further specified to be through the line of faithful Phinehas. <a ref='Psalms 106:32–33'>106:32–33</a> This scene looks back to <a ref='Numbers 20:1–13'>Nu 20:1–13</a> when Moses, provoked by the continuing rebellion of Israel, nonetheless wrongly struck the rock in anger (cf. <a ref='Exodus 11:8'>Ex 11:8</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 16:20'>16:20</a> ) and thus offended God (cf. <a ref='Numbers 20:12'>Nu 20:12</a> ). As a result, both Aaron (cf. <a ref='Numbers 20:22–29'>Nu 20:22–29</a> ) and Moses ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 34:1–8'>Dt 34:1–8</a> ) died prematurely without entering the Promised Land. <a ref='Psalms 106:32'>106:32</a> <b>the waters of Meribah.</b> Cf. <a ref='Numbers 20:13'>Nu 20:13</a> . <a ref='Psalms 106:33'>106:33</a> <b>His Spirit.</b> This most likely refers to the Holy Spirit of God. The Spirit of God had an extensive ministry in the OT (cf. <a ref='Genesis 1:2'>Ge 1:2</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 6:3'>6:3</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 23:2'>2Sa 23:2</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 9:30'>Ne 9:30</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 139:7'>Ps 139:7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 48:16'>Is 48:16</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 2:2'>Eze 2:2</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 3:12–14'>3:12–14</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 8:3'>8:3</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 11:1'>11:1</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 11:5'>5</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 11:24'>24</a> ; <a ref='Haggai 2:5'>Hag 2:5</a> , <a ref='Zechariah 7:12'>Zec 7:12</a> ). Both <a ref='Isaiah 63:10–11'>Is 63:10–11</a> and <a ref='Acts 7:51'>Ac 7:51</a> point to this particular event. <a ref='Psalms 106:34–39'>106:34–39</a> This section describes the general sins of Israel from the time they entered the Land ( <a ref='Jos 3-4'>Jos 3–4</a> ) until they were exiled to Assyria ( <a ref='2Ki 17'>2Ki 17</a> ) and Babylon ( <a ref='2Ki 24-25'>2Ki 24–25</a> ). They failed to expel the heathen and sadly conformed to their idolatry. <a ref='Psalms 106:36–38'>106:36–38</a> <b>idols … demons … idols.</b> Demons impersonate idols and encourage idol worship (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:17'>Dt 32:17</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 33:5–7'>2Chr 33:5–7</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:14–21'>1Co 10:14–21</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 9:20'>Rev 9:20</a> ). The sacrifice of children was not uncommon (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:31'>Dt 12:31</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 17:17'>2Ki 17:17</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 16:20–21'>Eze 16:20–21</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 106:39'>106:39</a> <b>their works … actions.</b> God held Israel directly responsible for their sin without excuse. <a ref='Psalms 106:40–43'>106:40–43</a> From the time of the judges until the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles, God used the hand of His enemies to discipline Israel for their sin. <a ref='Psalms 106:44–46'>106:44–46</a> This emphasizes the unconditional nature of God’s covenant with Abraham. <a ref='Psalms 106:45'>106:45</a> <b>He remembered … His covenant.</b> This answers the psalmist’s prayer of vv. <a ref='Psalms 106:4–5'>4–5</a> with regard to the Abrahamic Covenant that 1) the descendants of Abraham would multiply, and 2) they would possess the land ( <i>see note on <a ref='Psalms 105:9–10'>Ps 105:9–10</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Luke 1:72–75'>Lk 1:72–75</a> ). <b>for them.</b> A secondary complement to God, who was primarily acting for His name’s sake (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 106:8'>8</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 106:47'>106:47</a> The psalmist pleads, on behalf of the nation and in light of the Abrahamic Covenant, for the nation to be regathered in Israel. He remembers what the men of Moses’ day forgot, i.e., God as their Savior (cf. <a ref='Psalms 106:21'>106:21</a> ). Even though the tribes of Judah and Benjamin returned to Israel in Ezra and Nehemiah, this text looks ahead to the regathering of Israel at the time when the Lord Jesus Christ returns to rule over the promised Davidic ( <a ref='2Sa 7'>2Sa 7</a> ) millennial kingdom ( <a ref='Rev 20'>Rev 20</a> ) on earth (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 37:11–28'>Eze 37:11–28</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 14:4–8'>Hos 14:4–8</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:18–21'>Joel 3:18–21</a> ; <a ref='Amos 9:7–15'>Am 9:7–15</a> ; <a ref='Micah 7:14–20'>Mic 7:14–20</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 3:8–20'>Zep 3:8–20</a> ; <a ref='Zec 12-14'>Zec 12–14</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 106:48'>106:48</a> <b>From everlasting to everlasting.</b> With the hopeful prayer of <a ref='Psalms 106:47'>106:47</a> on his lips, the psalmist closes the fourth book of the Psalms ( <a ref='Ps 90-106'>Pss 90–106</a> ) with a grand benediction focusing on the eternal character of God, Israel’s Savior (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 16:36'>1Chr 16:36</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 41:13'>Pss 41:13</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 90:2'>90:2</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 107:1–43'>107:1–43</a> The opening line of <a ref='Ps 105-107'>Pss 105–107</a> , “Oh give thanks to Yahweh,” links together this trilogy of songs which praise God for His goodness and mercy to Israel. Most likely this psalm has a post-Exilic origin (cf. <a ref='Psalms 107:3'>107:3</a> ). The psalm develops two main themes: 1) praising God for His continual deliverance ( <a ref='Psalms 107:4–32'>107:4–32</a> ), and 2) remembering God’s response to man’s obedience/disobedience ( <a ref='Psalms 107:33–42'>107:33–42</a> ). I. The Call to Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 107:1–3'>107:1–3</a> ) II. The Cause of Rejoicing—Deliverance ( <a ref='Psalms 107:4–32'>107:4–32</a> ) III. The Consequences of Obedience/Disobedience ( <a ref='Psalms 107:33–42'>107:33–42</a> ) IV. The Commentary on Wisdom/Understanding ( <a ref='Psalms 107:43'>107:43</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 107:1–3'>107:1–3</a> All of those who have been delivered (redeemed) from the hand of Israel’s enemy focus on God’s goodness and everlasting mercy. They had been delivered through the centuries from Egypt to the south (cf. <a ref='Ex 12-14'>Ex 12–14</a> ), Syria and Assyria to the north (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 19:29–37'>2Ki 19:29–37</a> ), the Philistines to the west (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 8:1'>2Sa 8:1</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 18:8'>2Ki 18:8</a> ), and Babylon to the east (cf. <a ref='Ezr 1'>Ezr 1</a> ). Compare the psalmist’s prayer in <a ref='Psalms 106:47'>106:47</a> with v. <a ref='Psalms 107:3'>3</a> . <a ref='Psalms 107:4–32'>107:4–32</a> This portion contains four pictures or actual situations which illustrate the disastrous end of sin in the nation: 1) wandering in the wilderness (vv. <a ref='Psalms 107:4–9'>4–9</a> ), 2) languishing in prison (vv. <a ref='Psalms 107:10–16'>10–16</a> ); 3) enduring sickness (vv. <a ref='Psalms 107:17–22'>17–22</a> ); and 4) tossing on a stormy sea (vv. <a ref='Psalms 107:23–32'>23–32</a> ). Each picture follows the same sequence of four events: 1) man’s predicament (vv. <a ref='Psalms 107:4–5'>4–5</a> , <a ref='Psalms 107:10–12'>10–12</a> , <a ref='Psalms 107:17–18'>17–18</a> , <a ref='Psalms 107:23–27'>23–27</a> ); 2) man’s petition (vv. <a ref='Psalms 107:6'>6a</a> , <a ref='Psalms 107:13'>13a</a> , <a ref='Psalms 107:19'>19a</a> , <a ref='Psalms 107:28'>28a</a> ); 3) God’s pardon (vv. <a ref='Psalms 107:6–7'>6b–7</a> , <a ref='Psalms 107:13–14'>13b–14</a> , <a ref='Psalms 107:19–20'>19b–20</a> , <a ref='Psalms 107:28–30'>28b–30</a> ); and 4) man’s praise (vv. <a ref='Psalms 107:8–9'>8–9</a> , <a ref='Psalms 107:15–16'>15–16</a> , <a ref='Psalms 107:21–22'>21–22</a> , <a ref='Psalms 107:31–32'>31–32</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 107:4–9'>107:4–9</a> Possibly the psalmist looked back at the desert wanderings of ungrateful, faithless Israel after the miraculous Exodus ( <a ref='Nu 14'>Nu 14</a> – <a ref='Jos 2'>Jos 2</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 107:10–16'>107:10–16</a> Possibly the psalmist thought of the capture and imprisonment of King Zedekiah ca. 586 BC (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 25:4–7'>2Ki 25:4–7</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 39:4–8'>Jer 39:4–8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 52:1–11'>Jer 52:1–11</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 107:17–22'>107:17–22</a> Possibly the psalmist recalled the mass affliction and subsequent mass healing in <a ref='Numbers 21:4–9'>Nu 21:4–9</a> . <a ref='Psalms 107:23–32'>107:23–32</a> Possibly the psalmist had Jonah and the sailors bound for Tarshish in mind (cf. <a ref='Jon 1'>Jon 1</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 107:33–42'>107:33–42</a> This section contrasts God’s blessing in response to man’s obedience with God’s judgment on man’s sin. The psalmist makes his point with 4 illustrations: 1) descending from prosperity to poverty (vv. <a ref='Psalms 107:33–34'>33–34</a> ); 2) being lifted up from barrenness to blessedness (vv. <a ref='Psalms 107:35–38'>35–38</a> ); 3) falling from the top to the bottom (vv. <a ref='Psalms 107:39–40'>39–40</a> ); and 4) being elevated from low to high (vv. <a ref='Psalms 107:41–42'>41–42</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 107:33–34'>107:33–34</a> Perhaps the 3 years of drought from Ahab’s and Jezebel’s sins are in view (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 17:1'>1Ki 17:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 18:18'>18:18</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 107:35–38'>107:35–38</a> Perhaps the time of Abraham ( <a ref='Genesis 24:1'>Ge 24:1</a> , <a ref='Genesis 24:34–35'>34–35</a> ) or Joshua ( <a ref='Joshua 24:13'>Jos 24:13</a> ) is in view. <a ref='Psalms 107:39–40'>107:39–40</a> Perhaps the Assyrian Exile ( <a ref='2 Kings 17:4–6'>2Ki 17:4–6</a> ) or the Babylonian Captivity ( <a ref='2 Kings 24:14–15'>2Ki 24:14–15</a> ) is in view. <a ref='Psalms 107:41–42'>107:41–42</a> Perhaps the impoverished Jews in Egypt who were made rich with Egyptian gold and other treasures are in view (cf. <a ref='Exodus 1:13–14'>Ex 1:13–14</a> with <a ref='Exodus 3:21–22'>3:21–22</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 11:2'>11:2</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 12:35–36'>12:35–36</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 107:43'>107:43</a> Perhaps the psalmist has <a ref='Proverbs 8:1–36'>Pr 8:1–36</a> , <a ref='Ecclesiastes 12:13–14'>Ecc 12:13–14</a> , or <a ref='Hosea 14:9'>Hos 14:9</a> in mind as he pens these concluding words. <a ref='Psalms 108:1–13'>108:1–13</a> David combines portions of his own previously written <a ref='Ps 57'>Pss 57</a> and <a ref='Ps 60'>60</a> to make up this psalm commemorating God’s victories (vv. <a ref='Psalms 108:1–5'>1–5</a> are from <a ref='Psalms 57:7–11'>57:7–11</a> ; vv. <a ref='Psalms 108:6–13'>6–13</a> are from <a ref='Psalms 60:5–12'>60:5–12</a> ). He deleted the laments that began each psalm ( <a ref='Psalms 57:1–6'>57:1–6</a> and <a ref='Psalms 60:1–4'>60:1–4</a> ) while combining his own words of exaltation and confidence in God with only slight word variation. No specific historical occasion behind this psalm is given. <i>See notes on <a ref='Psalms 57:7–11'>Ps 57:7–11</a> and <a ref='Psalms 60:5–12'>Ps 60:5–12</a> .</i> I. Personal Exaltation of God ( <a ref='Psalms 108:1–5'>108:1–5</a> ) II. Personal Confidence in God ( <a ref='Psalms 108:6–13'>108:6–13</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 109:1–31'>109:1–31</a> This imprecatory psalm of David cannot be conclusively connected by the psalm’s general details with any particular incident/person in the king’s life as chronicled in 1-2Sa; 1Ki; and 1Chr David responds here to those who have launched a vicious verbal assault of false accusations against him (cf. <a ref='Psalms 109:2–3'>109:2–3</a> , <a ref='Psalms 109:20'>20</a> ). This psalm is considered messianic in nature, since <a ref='Acts 1:20'>Ac 1:20</a> quotes v. <a ref='Psalms 109:8'>8</a> in reference to Judas’ punishment for betraying Christ (cf. <a ref='Psalms 41:9'>Pss 41:9</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 69:25'>69:25</a> ). David reverses roles with his enemies by moving from being the accused in man’s court to being the accuser/prosecutor before the bar of God. I. The Plaintiff’s Plea ( <a ref='Psalms 109:1–5'>109:1–5</a> ) II. The Punishment Desired ( <a ref='Psalms 109:6–20'>109:6–20</a> ) III. The Petition for Justice ( <a ref='Psalms 109:21–29'>109:21–29</a> ) IV. The Praise of the Judge ( <a ref='Psalms 109:30–31'>109:30–31</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 109:1'>109:1</a> <b>O God of my praise.</b> David begins and ends (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 109:30'>30</a> ) with praise for the Chief Justice of the universe. At v. <a ref='Psalms 109:21'>21</a> , David addresses the Judge as “O Yahweh, O Lord” and at v. <a ref='Psalms 109:26'>26</a> as “O Yahweh my God.” <a ref='Psalms 109:2–5'>109:2–5</a> David’s complaint was that the innocent were being accused by the guilty. He asserted that the charges were without cause ( <a ref='Psalms 109:3'>109:3</a> ). While Doeg the Edomite has been identified by some (cf. <a ref='1Sa 21-22'>1Sa 21–22</a> ; <a ref='Ps 52'>Ps 52</a> ), the far more likely candidate would be Saul (cf. <a ref='1Sa 18-27'>1Sa 18–27</a> ). Eight of the 14 historical superscriptions in other psalms refer to the sufferings of David related to Saul’s pursuits for the purpose of killing David (cf. <a ref='Ps 18'>Pss 18</a> , <a ref='Ps 34'>34</a> , <a ref='Ps 54'>54</a> , <a ref='Ps 56-57'>56–57</a> , <a ref='Ps 59'>59</a> , <a ref='Ps 63'>63</a> , <a ref='Ps 142'>142</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 109:2'>109:2</a> In vv. <a ref='Psalms 109:2–5'>2–5</a> , <a ref='Psalms 109:20'>20</a> , <a ref='Psalms 109:25'>25</a> , <a ref='Psalms 109:27–29'>27–29</a> , David refers to a group of accusers, in contrast to vv. <a ref='Psalms 109:6–19'>6–19</a> where an individual is mentioned. Most likely, the individual is the group leader. <a ref='Psalms 109:6–20'>109:6–20</a> The Mosaic law had anticipated false accusations and malicious witnesses (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:16–21'>Dt 19:16–21</a> ) by decreeing that the false accuser was to be given the punishment intended for the accused. It would appear that David had this law in mind here and vv. <a ref='Psalms 109:26–29'>26–29</a> . Thus, his imprecations are not malicious maledictions, but rather a call for justice according to the law. These severe words have respect not to the penitent, but to the impenitent and hard-hearted foes of God and His cause, whose inevitable fate is set. <a ref='Psalms 109:8'>109:8</a> The apostle Peter cited this verse as justification for replacing Judas the betrayer with another apostle (cf. <a ref='Acts 1:20'>Ac 1:20</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 109:21–29'>109:21–29</a> David petitioned the court for justice by asking for deliverance for the judge’s sake ( <a ref='Psalms 109:21'>109:21</a> ) and then for his own sake (vv. <a ref='Psalms 109:22–25'>22–25</a> ). Afterwards, he requested that his enemies be rightfully punished (vv. <a ref='Psalms 109:26–29'>26–29</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 109:30–31'>109:30–31</a> David’s praise for the Divine Magistrate (v. <a ref='Psalms 109:30'>30</a> ) was based on his confidence in the compassion and mercy of the judge (v. <a ref='Psalms 109:31'>31</a> ). <a ref='2Sa 22'>Second Samuel 22</a> and <a ref='Ps 18'>Ps 18</a> record the general outcome to David’s case, which was tried in God’s courtroom. <a ref='Psalms 110:1–7'>110:1–7</a> This psalm contains one of the most exalted prophetic portions of Scripture presenting Jesus Christ as both a holy king and a royal High Priest—something that no human monarch of Israel ever experienced. It, along with <a ref='Ps 118'>Ps 118</a> , is by far the most quoted psalm in the NT ( <a ref='Matthew 22:44'>Mt 22:44</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 26:64'>26:64</a> ; <a ref='Mark 12:36'>Mk 12:36</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:62'>14:62</a> ; <a ref='Luke 20:42–43'>Lk 20:42–43</a> ; <a ref='Luke 22:69'>22:69</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:34–35'>Ac 2:34–35</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 1:13'>Heb 1:13</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 5:6'>5:6</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 7:17'>7:17</a> , <a ref='Hebrews 7:21'>21</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:13'>10:13</a> ). While portraying the perfect king, the perfect High Priest, and the perfect government, <a ref='Ps 110'>Ps 110</a> declares Christ’s current role in heaven as the resurrected Savior ( <a ref='Psalms 110:1'>110:1</a> ) and His future role on earth as the reigning Monarch ( <a ref='Psalms 110:2–7'>110:2–7</a> ). This psalm is decidedly messianic and millennial in content. Jesus Christ ( <a ref='Matthew 22:43–44'>Mt 22:43–44</a> ) verifies the Davidic authorship. The exact occasion of this psalm is unknown, but it could easily have been associated with God’s declaration of the Davidic Covenant in <a ref='2 Samuel 7:4–17'>2Sa 7:4–17</a> . I. Christ the King ( <a ref='Psalms 110:1–3'>110:1–3</a> ) II. Christ the High Priest ( <a ref='Psalms 110:4–7'>110:4–7</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 110:1'>110:1</a> <b>my Lord.</b> Refers to the divine/human King of Israel—the Lord Jesus Christ. Christ’s humanity descended from David, which is demanded by the Davidic promise of <a ref='2 Samuel 7:12'>2Sa 7:12</a> . Using this passage, Christ also declared His deity in the Gospels ( <a ref='Matthew 22:44'>Mt 22:44</a> ; <a ref='Mark 12:36'>Mk 12:36</a> ; <a ref='Luke 20:42–43'>Lk 20:42–43</a> ) by arguing that only God could have been lord to King David. <b>My right hand.</b> God the Father invited God the Son in His ascension to sit at the place of honor in the heavenly throne room (cf. <a ref='Acts 2:22–36'>Ac 2:22–36</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:10–12'>Heb 10:10–12</a> ). <b>Your enemies … a footstool.</b> Footstool was an ancient Near Eastern picture of absolute victory portraying the idea that one’s enemy was now underfoot (cf. <a ref='Psalms 8:6–7'>Pss 8:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 47:3'>47:3</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 66:1'>Is 66:1</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:27'>1Co 15:27</a> ). This anticipates Christ’s Second Advent (cf. <a ref='Revelation 19:11–21'>Rev 19:11–21</a> ) as a conquering king (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 10:13'>Heb 10:13</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 110:2'>110:2</a> <b>Your strong scepter.</b> From the human side, the ancestral staff of Judah is in view (cf. <a ref='Genesis 49:10'>Ge 49:10</a> ). From the divine side, the rod of iron by which King Jesus will subdue the earth is intended (cf. <a ref='Psalms 2:9'>Ps 2:9</a> ). <b>Zion.</b> God intends to install His ultimate earthly king in Jerusalem (the southwest side is Zion; cf. <a ref='Psalms 132:13–18'>Ps 132:13–18</a> ). The earthly Zion (cf. <a ref='Psalms 2:6'>Ps 2:6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 59:20'>Is 59:20</a> ) is in view, not the heavenly Zion because 1) there are no enemies in heaven, and 2) none of the activities in vv. <a ref='Psalms 110:5–7'>5–7</a> will take place in heaven. <b>Have dominion.</b> Christ will rule on the earthly throne of His father David (cf. <a ref='Luke 1:32'>Lk 1:32</a> ), in fulfillment of <a ref='Isaiah 9:6'>Is 9:6</a> and <a ref='Zechariah 14:9'>Zec 14:9</a> . <a ref='Psalms 110:3'>110:3</a> <b>offer themselves.</b> The redeemed inhabitants of earth will willingly serve the King of kings and Lord of lords. <b>the day of Your power.</b> Refers to the power displayed during the millennial reign of Jesus Christ (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 14:1–21'>Zec 14:1–21</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:11–20:6'>Rev 19:11—20:6</a> ). <b>splendor of holiness … womb … dew.</b> This seems to apply to the King and to represent Him as in the constant vigor of youth, a period distinguished by strength and activity, or it may refer to His holiness, eternality and deity. <a ref='Psalms 110:4'>110:4</a> <b>You are a priest.</b> The first time in the history of Israel when a king simultaneously served as High Priest. Christ (a.k.a. “Branch,” cf. <a ref='Isaiah 4:2'>Is 4:2</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:5–6'>Jer 23:5–6</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 3:8'>Zec 3:8</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 6:12–13'>6:12–13</a> ) will build the temple at which the world will worship God (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 7:13'>2Sa 7:13</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 2:2–4'>Is 2:2–4</a> ; <a ref='Eze 40-48'>Eze 40–48</a> ). <b>forever.</b> Christ represents the final and foremost High Priest in the history of Israel. <b>the order of Melchizedek.</b> This High Priest could not be of Aaron’s lineage in that he would not be eternal, not be of Judah, not be a king, and not be of the New Covenant ( <a ref='Jeremiah 31:31–33'>Jer 31:31–33</a> ; <a ref='Heb 8-9'>Heb 8–9</a> ). Melchizedek, which means “king of righteousness,” served as the human priest/king of Salem in <a ref='Genesis 14:17–20'>Ge 14:17–20</a> and provides a picture of the order of Christ’s priesthood (cf. <a ref='Hebrews 5:6'>Heb 5:6</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 7:17'>7:17</a> , <a ref='Hebrews 7:21'>21</a> ). The sons of Zadok will serve with Christ in the Millennium as His human priestly associates (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 44:15'>Eze 44:15</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 48:11'>48:11</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 110:5'>110:5</a> <b>Your right hand.</b> The roles have here reversed—the Father now stands at the right hand of the Son. This pictures the Father supplying the needs of the Son (cf. <a ref='Psalms 16:8'>Pss 16:8</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 109:31'>109:31</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 41:13'>Is 41:13</a> ). The Father provides the defeat of His enemies on earth so that His Son can fulfill God’s land and nation promises to Abraham ( <a ref='Genesis 12:1–2'>Ge 12:1–2</a> ) and kingship promise to David ( <a ref='2 Samuel 7:12–13'>2Sa 7:12–13</a> , <a ref='2 Samuel 7:16'>16</a> ). <b>the day of His anger.</b> This refers to the “Day of Yahweh” (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 110:3'>3</a> “the day of Your power”), which finds its global expression at the end of Daniel’s 70th week (cf. <a ref='Daniel 9:24–27'>Da 9:24–27</a> ). This term exclusively speaks of God’s wrath, which will be poured out on an unrepentant world in order to set up Christ’s 1,000-year (millennial) reign (cf. <a ref='Joel 2:1'>Joel 2:1</a> , <a ref='Joel 2:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Joel 2:31'>31</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:14'>3:14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 6:16–17'>Rev 6:16–17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:19'>14:19</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:15'>19:15</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 110:6'>110:6</a> <b>render justice … fill … crush.</b> Cf. <a ref='Psalms 2:8–9'>Pss 2:8–9</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 50:1–6'>50:1–6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 2:4'>Is 2:4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 9:6–7'>9:6–7</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 2:44–45'>Da 2:44–45</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 7:26–27'>7:26–27</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:2'>Joel 3:2</a> , <a ref='Joel 3:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:3'>Mic 4:3</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 25:32'>Mt 25:32</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 6:15–17'>Rev 6:15–17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:20'>14:20</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:14'>16:14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:19–21'>19:19–21</a> . <a ref='Psalms 110:7'>110:7</a> <b>He will drink.</b> This pictures a refreshed conqueror who has kingly access to the whole world. This could anticipate the east-west flow of fresh water out of Jerusalem as recorded in <a ref='Zechariah 14:8'>Zec 14:8</a> . <b>He will lift up.</b> The lifted head pictures Christ’s strength in victory (cf. <a ref='Psalms 3:3'>Pss 3:3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 27:6'>27:6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 75:10'>75:10</a> ). As <a ref='Psalms 22:28'>Ps 22:28</a> reports, “For the kingdom is Yahweh’s and He rules over the nations” (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 14:9'>Zec 14:9</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 111:1–10'>111:1–10</a> <a ref='Ps 111'>Psalms 111</a> and <a ref='Ps 112'>112</a> are alike in that 1) they both begin with, “Praise Yah!” (as does <a ref='Ps 113'>Ps 113</a> ), and 2) they both are acrostics with 22 lines corresponding to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. <a ref='Ps 111'>Psalm 111</a> exalts the works of God, while <a ref='Ps 112'>Ps 112</a> extols the man who fears God.

Overall, the greater work of redemption seems to be in view (v. <a ref='Psalms 111:9'>9</a> ) without excluding lesser works of a temporal nature (vv. <a ref='Psalms 111:5–6'>5–6</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 111:5'>111:5</a> <b>food … His covenant.</b> It is quite possible that the psalmist has alluded to God’s faithfulness in providing food for Jacob through Joseph ( <a ref='Ge 37-50'>Ge 37–50</a> ) in fulfillment of the Abrahamic Covenant to make the nation like the stars of the sky ( <a ref='Genesis 15:5'>Ge 15:5</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 111:6'>111:6</a> <b>an inheritance of the nations.</b> It seems even more sure that the psalmist has the Abrahamic Covenant in view (cf. <a ref='Genesis 15:18–21'>Ge 15:18–21</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 17:1–8'>17:1–8</a> ), specifically the Exodus (Ex–Dt) and the conquering/dividing of the land (Joshua). <i>See notes on <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:1–2'>Dt 7:1–2</a> .</i> <a ref='Psalms 111:9'>111:9</a> <b>commanded His covenant forever.</b> In light of vv. <a ref='Psalms 111:5–6'>5–6</a> and <a ref='Galatians 3:6–9'>Ga 3:6–9</a> , this appears to look at the redemption aspects of the Abrahamic Covenant, which was declared frequently to be an “everlasting” or “forever” covenant (cf. <a ref='Genesis 17:7'>Ge 17:7</a> , <a ref='Genesis 17:13'>13</a> , <a ref='Genesis 17:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='1 Chronicles 16:15'>1Chr 16:15</a> , <a ref='1 Chronicles 16:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 105:8'>Ps 105:8</a> , <a ref='Psalms 105:10'>10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 24:5'>Is 24:5</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 111:10'>111:10</a> <b>The fear of Yahweh.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Proverbs 1:7'>Pr 1:7</a> .</i> <a ref='Psalms 112:1–10'>112:1–10</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Psalms 111:1–10'>Ps 111:1–10</a> .</i> I.

These were sung at Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles, but had the greatest significance at Passover, which celebrated the Jews’ deliverance from Egypt (cf. <a ref='Ex 12-14'>Ex 12–14</a> ). Traditionally, <a ref='Ps 113-114'>Pss 113–114</a> were sung before the Passover meal and <a ref='Ps 115-118'>Pss 115–118</a> afterwards. <a ref='Ps 118'>Psalm 118</a> would most likely be what Christ and the disciples sang before they left the Upper Room the night Christ was betrayed (cf. <a ref='Matthew 26:30'>Mt 26:30</a> ; <a ref='Mark 14:26'>Mk 14:26</a> ). There are two other notable sets of praise in the Psalter: 1) The Great Hallel ( <a ref='Ps 120-136'>Pss 120–136</a> ) and 2) The Final Hallel ( <a ref='Ps 145-150'>Pss 145–150</a> ). I.

God is responsible for both the rich and the poor ( <a ref='Proverbs 22:2'>Pr 22:2</a> ). God’s compassion reaches out to the poor and needy (cf. <a ref='Psalms 72:12–13'>Ps 72:12–13</a> ). Ultimately, Christ came to save those who are poor in spirit (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 61:2'>Is 61:2</a> ; <a ref='Luke 4:18'>Lk 4:18</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 113:9'>113:9</a> <b>the barren woman.</b> Sarah ( <a ref='Genesis 21:2'>Ge 21:2</a> ), Rebekah ( <a ref='Genesis 25:21'>Ge 25:21</a> ), and Rachel ( <a ref='Genesis 30:23'>Ge 30:23</a> ) would be the most significant since the outcome of the Abrahamic Covenant depended on these childless women being blessed by God to be mothers. <a ref='Psalms 114:1–8'>114:1–8</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Psalms 113:1–9'>Ps 113:1–9</a> .</i> This psalm is the one most explicitly related to the Exodus ( <a ref='Ex 12-14'>Ex 12–14</a> ).

To all 3 groups, God is their help and shield. <a ref='Psalms 115:16'>115:16</a> <b>the earth.</b> Strong implications that planet earth alone is the dwelling place of life. <a ref='Psalms 116:1–19'>116:1–19</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Psalms 113:1–9'>Ps 113:1–9</a> .</i> This is an intensely personal “thank you” psalm to Yahweh for saving the psalmist from death ( <a ref='Psalms 116:3'>116:3</a> , <a ref='Psalms 116:8'>8</a> ). The occasion and author remain unknown, although the language used by Jonah in his prayer from the fish’s stomach is remarkably similar. While this appears to deal with physical death, the same song could be sung by those who have been saved from spiritual death. I.

It rehearses the principle of walking by faith, not by sight. <a ref='Psalms 116:11'>116:11</a> <b>All men are liars.</b> Either the psalmist is reacting to his false accusers or to men who say that they can deliver him but have not. <a ref='Psalms 116:12'>116:12</a> <b>What shall I give.</b> God needs nothing and puts no price on His free mercy and grace. The psalmist renders the only acceptable gift—obedience and thanksgiving. <a ref='Psalms 116:13'>116:13</a> <b>the cup of salvation.</b> This is the only place in the OT where this exact phrase is used. It probably has the meaning of the cup in <a ref='Psalms 16:5'>Pss 16:5</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 23:5'>23:5</a> ; i.e., the redeemed life circumstances provided by God, in contrast to <a ref='Psalms 75:8'>Ps 75:8</a> , which speaks about the cup of God’s wrath. <a ref='Psalms 116:14'>116:14</a> <b>I shall pay my vows.</b> Most likely this refers to the vows made during the time of duress (cf. <a ref='Psalms 116:18–19'>116:18–19</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 116:15–16'>116:15–16</a> The psalmist realized what a special blessing his deliverance (“loosed my bonds”) was in light of v. <a ref='Psalms 116:15'>15</a> . Therefore, he reemphasized his role as a servant of God following the example of his mother. <a ref='Psalms 116:17–19'>116:17–19</a> These verses parallel vv. <a ref='Psalms 116:13–14'>13–14</a> .

This pivotal psalm exhibits 3 distinguishing features: 1) it is the shortest psalm; 2) it is the shortest chapter in the Bible; and 3) it is the middle chapter of the Bible. That God looked redemptively beyond the borders of Israel in the OT is made clear here. The psalm looks back to God’s intent for Adam and Eve in Eden ( <a ref='Ge 1-2'>Ge 1–2</a> ) and looks ahead to the ultimate fulfillment in the new heavens and earth ( <a ref='Rev 21-22'>Rev 21–22</a> ). I. A Global Invitation ( <a ref='Psalms 117:1'>117:1</a> ) II. A Grand Explanation ( <a ref='Psalms 117:2'>117:2</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 117:1'>117:1</a> <b>nations … peoples!</b> Paul quoted this verse in <a ref='Romans 15:11'>Ro 15:11</a> to make the point that from the very beginning of time God has pursued a worldwide redemptive purpose (cf. <a ref='Romans 15:7–13'>Ro 15:7–13</a> ). Other passages quoted by Paul in <a ref='Ro 15'>Ro 15</a> to make this point include: <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:43'>Dt 32:43</a> , <a ref='2 Samuel 22:50'>2Sa 22:50</a> , and <a ref='Isaiah 11:10'>Is 11:10</a> . While not as obvious in the OT, the NT makes this point unmistakably clear (cf. <a ref='Acts 10:34–35'>Ac 10:34–35</a> ; <a ref='Romans 1:16'>Ro 1:16</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 12:13'>1Co 12:13</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:1–29'>Ga 3:1–29</a> , esp. <a ref='Galatians 3:28'>28</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 3:11'>Col 3:11</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 117:2'>117:2</a> The reasons for such exalted praise as that commanded in v. <a ref='Psalms 117:1'>1</a> are: 1) because of God’s redemptive kindness, and 2) because of God’s eternal truth. Therefore, what God has promised, He will provide (cf. <a ref='John 6:37–40'>Jn 6:37–40</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 118:1–29'>118:1–29</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Psalms 113:1–9'>Ps 113:1–9</a> .</i> This psalm, along with <a ref='Ps 110'>Ps 110</a> , is intensely messianic and thus the most quoted by the NT ( <a ref='Matthew 21:9'>Mt 21:9</a> , <a ref='Matthew 21:42'>42</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 23:39'>23:39</a> ; <a ref='Mark 11:9–10'>Mk 11:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Mark 12:10–11'>12:10–11</a> ; <a ref='Luke 13:35'>Lk 13:35</a> ; <a ref='Luke 19:38'>19:38</a> ; <a ref='Luke 20:17'>20:17</a> ; <a ref='John 12:13'>Jn 12:13</a> ; <a ref='Acts 4:11'>Ac 4:11</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 13:6'>Heb 13:6</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:7'>1Pe 2:7</a> ). Neither the author nor the specific circumstances of the psalm are identified. Two reasonable possibilities could be entertained: 1) it was written during Moses’ day in the Exodus, or 2) it was written sometime after the Jews returned to Jerusalem from Exile. Probably it was the former, given 1) the nature of the Egyptian Hallel (esp. <a ref='Ps 114'>Ps 114</a> ); 2) its use by the Jewish community especially at Passover; 3) the close similarity to Moses’ experience in the Exodus; 4) the striking similarity in language ( <a ref='Psalms 118:14'>Ps 118:14</a> with <a ref='Exodus 15:2'>Ex 15:2</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 118:15–16'>118:15–16</a> with <a ref='Exodus 15:6'>Ex 15:6</a> , <a ref='Exodus 15:12'>12</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 118:28'>118:28</a> with <a ref='Exodus 15:2'>Ex 15:2</a> ); and 5) the particularly pointed messianic significance as it relates to the redemption provided by Christ our Passover ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 5:7'>1Co 5:7</a> ). It seems reasonable to propose that Moses possibly wrote this beautiful psalm to look back in worship at the historical Passover and look ahead in wonder to the spiritual Passover in Christ. I.

Jesus may have had this psalm in mind when He taught about “the narrow gate” in <a ref='Matthew 7:13–14'>Mt 7:13–14</a> . <a ref='Psalms 118:21'>118:21</a> <b>my salvation.</b> Yahweh has delivered the psalmist from otherwise certain defeat and death (cf. <a ref='Psalms 118:14–15'>118:14–15</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 118:22–26'>118:22–26</a> The NT quotes of vv. <a ref='Psalms 118:22–23'>22–23</a> and vv. <a ref='Psalms 118:25–26'>25–26</a> lend strong messianic significance here. If Moses is the author, then the NT writers use a perfect analogy in connecting this passage to Christ. For example, Moses said that God would raise up another prophet like himself ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:15'>Dt 18:15</a> ). Peter identified this other prophet as the Lord Jesus Christ (cf. <a ref='Acts 3:11–26'>Ac 3:11–26</a> ). So Moses is a legitimate, biblically recognized type of Christ. <a ref='Psalms 118:22'>118:22</a> <b>stone … builders rejected … chief corner</b> stone <b>.</b> Peter identified the chief cornerstone in the NT as Christ ( <a ref='Acts 4:11'>Ac 4:11</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:7'>1Pe 2:7</a> ). In the parable of the vineyard ( <a ref='Matthew 21:42'>Mt 21:42</a> ; <a ref='Mark 12:10–11'>Mk 12:10–11</a> ; <a ref='Luke 20:17'>Lk 20:17</a> ), the rejected son of the vineyard owner is likened to the rejected stone which became the chief cornerstone. Christ was that rejected stone. Jewish leaders were pictured as builders of the nation. Now, this passage in v. <a ref='Psalms 118:22'>22</a> has a historical basis which is paralleled in its major features by analogy with the rejection of Christ who came to deliver/save the nation. Moses’ experience, as a type of Christ, pictured Christ’s rejection. On at least 3 occasions Moses (“stone”) was rejected by the Jews (“builders”) as their God sent the deliverer (“chief corner <i>stone</i> ”). For examples see <a ref='Exodus 2:11–15'>Ex 2:11–15</a> , cf. <a ref='Acts 7:35'>Ac 7:35</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 14:10–14'>Ex 14:10–14</a> , <a ref='Exodus 14:10'>10</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 16:1–3'>16:1–3</a> , <a ref='Exodus 16:11–12'>11–12</a> , <a ref='Exodus 16:20'>20</a> . <a ref='Psalms 118:24'>118:24</a> <b>the day.</b> Probably refers to 1) the day of deliverance and/or 2) the day the stone was made the chief cornerstone, which they now celebrate. <a ref='Psalms 118:25'>118:25</a> <b>Yahweh, save!</b> Transliterated from Hebrew, this becomes “Hosanna.” These words were shouted by the crowd to Christ at the time of His triumphal entry to Jerusalem ( <a ref='Matthew 21:9'>Mt 21:9</a> ; <a ref='Mark 11:9–10'>Mk 11:9–10</a> ; <a ref='John 12:13'>Jn 12:13</a> ). Days later they rejected Him because He did not provide military/political deliverance. <a ref='Psalms 118:26'>118:26</a> <b>Blessed.</b> Christ taught that the nation of Israel would not see Him again after His departure (ascension to heaven) until they could genuinely offer these words to Him at His second coming (cf. <a ref='Matthew 23:39'>Mt 23:39</a> ; <a ref='Luke 13:35'>Lk 13:35</a> ). In this historical text, it could have easily been sung by the Jews of Moses’ day, especially at the end of the 40 years but prior to Moses’ death (cf. <a ref='De 1-33'>Dt 1–33</a> ). <b>the house of Yahweh.</b> A phrase used in reference to the tabernacle of Moses (cf. <a ref='Exodus 23:19'>Ex 23:19</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 34:26'>34:26</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:18'>Dt 23:18</a> ) and later the temple (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 6:1'>1Ki 6:1</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 118:27'>118:27</a> <b>light.</b> Similar to the Mosaic benediction of <a ref='Numbers 6:25'>Nu 6:25</a> . <b>the altar.</b> The altar of burnt offerings, which stood on the east in the court outside of the Holy Place (cf. <a ref='Exodus 27:1–8'>Ex 27:1–8</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 38:1–7'>38:1–7</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 118:28'>118:28</a> This bears a striking resemblance to <a ref='Exodus 15:2'>Ex 15:2</a> . <a ref='Psalms 118:29'>118:29</a> A repetition of <a ref='Psalms 118:1'>118:1</a> . <a ref='Psalms 119:1–176'>119:1–176</a> This longest of psalms and chapters in the Bible stands as the “Mt. Everest” of the Psalter. It joins <a ref='Ps 1'>Pss 1</a> and <a ref='Ps 19'>19</a> in exalting God’s Word. The author is unknown for certain, although David, Daniel, or Ezra have reasonably been suggested. The psalmist apparently wrote while under some sort of serious duress (cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 119:23'>23</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:42'>42</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:51'>51</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:61'>61</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:67'>67</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:71'>71</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:78'>78</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:86–87'>86–87</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:95'>95</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:110'>110</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:121'>121</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:134'>134</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:139'>139</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:143'>143</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:146'>146</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:153–154'>153–154</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:157'>157</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:161'>161</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:169'>169</a> ). This is an acrostic psalm (cf. <a ref='Ps 9-10'>Pss 9–10</a> , <a ref='Ps 25'>25</a> , <a ref='Ps 34'>34</a> , <a ref='Ps 37'>37</a> , <a ref='Ps 111-112'>111–112</a> , <a ref='Ps 145'>145</a> ) composed of 22 sections, each containing 8 lines. All 8 lines of the first section start with the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet; thus the psalm continues until all 22 letters have been used in order. The 8 different terms referring to Scripture occurring throughout the psalm are: 1) law, 2) testimonies, 3) precepts, 4) statutes, 5) commandments, 6) judgments, 7) word, and 8) ordinances. From before sunrise to beyond sunset, the Word of God dominated the psalmist’s life, e.g., 1) before dawn (v. <a ref='Psalms 119:147'>147</a> ), 2) daily (v. <a ref='Psalms 119:97'>97</a> ), 3) 7 times daily (v. <a ref='Psalms 119:164'>164</a> ), 4) nightly (vv. <a ref='Psalms 119:55'>55</a> , <a ref='Psalms 119:148'>148</a> ), and 5) at midnight (v. <a ref='Psalms 119:62'>62</a> ). Other than the acrostic form, <a ref='Ps 119'>Ps 119</a> does not have an outline. Rather, there are many frequently recurring themes which will be delineated in the notes. <a ref='Psalms 119:1–2'>119:1–2</a> <b>blessed … blessed.</b> Similar to <a ref='Psalms 1:1–3'>Ps 1:1–3</a> .

Prayer for Deliverance ( <a ref='Psalms 141:8–10'>141:8–10</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 141:2'>141:2</a> <b>incense … evening offering.</b> David desired that his prayers and stretching forth for God’s help ( <a ref='Psalms 68:31'>Pss 68:31</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 77:2'>77:2</a> ) be as disciplined and regular as the offering of incense ( <a ref='Exodus 30:7–8'>Ex 30:7–8</a> ) and burnt offerings ( <a ref='Exodus 29:38–39'>Ex 29:38–39</a> ) in the tabernacle. <a ref='Psalms 141:3–4'>141:3–4</a> David prayed that God would protect him from the kind of evil that characterized his own enemy. <a ref='Psalms 141:5'>141:5</a> David acknowledged that God would use other righteous men to answer his prayer in vv. <a ref='Psalms 141:3–4'>3–4</a> (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 9:8'>Pr 9:8</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 19:25'>19:25</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 27:6'>27:6</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 27:17'>27:17</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 141:6'>141:6</a> <b>judges … thrown down.</b> That the leaders of the wicked would be punished by being thrown over a cliff (cf. <a ref='Luke 4:28–29'>Lk 4:28–29</a> ) is at the heart of David’s prayer (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 141:5'>5</a> ). <b>my words … pleasant.</b> In the sense that David’s words were true. <a ref='Psalms 141:7'>141:7</a> <b>Our bones.</b> The basis on which the judges were thrown over the cliff—they had first done this to the righteous (cf. v. <a ref='Psalms 141:10'>10</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 141:10'>141:10</a> <b>fall into their own nets.</b> David prays that the wicked will be destroyed by their own devices. <a ref='Psalms 142:1–7'>142:1–7</a> Under the same circumstances as <a ref='Ps 57'>Ps 57</a> (according to the superscription), David recounted his desperate days hiding in the cave of Adullam ( <a ref='1 Samuel 22:1'>1Sa 22:1</a> ) while Saul sought him to take his life ( <a ref='1Sa 18-24'>1Sa 18–24</a> ). It appears that David’s situation, for the moment at least, seems hopeless without God’s intervention. <a ref='Ps 91'>Psalm 91</a> provides the truths that bring the solution. I. Cry of David ( <a ref='Psalms 142:1–2'>142:1–2</a> ) II. Circumstances of David ( <a ref='Psalms 142:3–4'>142:3–4</a> ) III.

David’s Plea ( <a ref='Psalms 143:7–12'>143:7–12</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 143:1'>143:1</a> <b>faithfulness … righteousness!</b> David fervently appeals to God’s character. <a ref='Psalms 143:2'>143:2</a> <b>no one living is righteous.</b> David admits his own unrighteousness and realizes that if he is to be delivered for righteousness’ sake (cf. <a ref='Psalms 143:11'>143:11</a> ), it will be because of God’s righteousness, not his own. <a ref='Psalms 143:6'>143:6</a> <b>a weary land.</b> As a drought-struck land yearns for life-giving water, so persecuted David longs for his life-giving Deliverer. <a ref='Psalms 143:7'>143:7</a> <b>Your face.</b> An anthropomorphism picturing God’s attention to the psalmist’s plight. <a ref='Psalms 143:10'>143:10</a> <b>Your … Spirit.</b> Refers to the Holy Spirit (cf. <a ref='Psalms 51:11'>Pss 51:11</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 139:7'>139:7</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Psalms 51:11'>Ps 51:11</a> .</i> <a ref='Psalms 143:11'>143:11</a> <b>sake of Your name.</b> David appeals to God’s benefit and honor, not his own (cf. <a ref='Psalms 23:3'>Pss 23:3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 31:3'>31:3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 79:9'>79:9</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 143:12'>143:12</a> <b>Your slave.</b> To attack God’s servant is to attack God, thus bringing God to the rescue. <a ref='Psalms 144:1–15'>144:1–15</a> This Davidic psalm, in part ( <a ref='Psalms 144:1–8'>144:1–8</a> ), is very similar to <a ref='Psalms 18:1–15'>Ps 18:1–15</a> . It could be that this psalm was written under the same kind of circumstances as the former, i.e., on the day that Yahweh delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 22:1–18'>2Sa 22:1–18</a> ). I. God’s Greatness ( <a ref='Psalms 144:1–2'>144:1–2</a> ) II. Man’s Insignificance ( <a ref='Psalms 144:3–4'>144:3–4</a> ) III. God’s Power ( <a ref='Psalms 144:5–8'>144:5–8</a> ) IV. Man’s Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 144:9–10'>144:9–10</a> ) V.

God empowered the king to subdue His enemies. <a ref='Psalms 144:2'>144:2</a> God provided 6 benefits: 1) loving-kindness, 2) a fortress, 3) a stronghold, 4) a deliverer, 5) a shield, and 6) a refuge. <a ref='Psalms 144:3–4'>144:3–4</a> Eternal God is contrasted with short-lived man (cf. <a ref='Psalms 8:4'>Ps 8:4</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 144:5–8'>144:5–8</a> Highly figurative language is used to portray God as the heavenly warrior who comes to fight on earth on behalf of David against God’s enemies. <a ref='Psalms 144:9'>144:9</a> <b>a new song.</b> A song of victory that celebrates deliverance/salvation (cf. <a ref='Psalms 33:3'>Pss 33:3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 40:3'>40:3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 96:1'>96:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 98:1'>98:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 144:9'>144:9</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 149:1'>149:1</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 5:9'>Rev 5:9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:3'>14:3</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 144:11'>144:11</a> Cf. vv. <a ref='Psalms 144:7–8'>7–8</a> . <a ref='Psalms 144:12'>144:12</a> <b>sons … daughters.</b> God’s rescue of David’s kingdom from foreigners would bring blessing on families. <a ref='Psalms 144:13–14'>144:13–14</a> <b>granaries … flocks … cattle.</b> Blessing would also come to the agricultural efforts. <a ref='Psalms 144:14'>144:14</a> <b>Without mishap … loss … outcry.</b> Peace, not strife, would characterize the land. <a ref='Psalms 145:1–21'>145:1–21</a> David penned this most exquisite conclusion to his 73 psalms in the Psalter. Here, the king of Israel extols and celebrates the King of Eternity for who He is, what He has done, and what He has promised. Not only rich in content, this psalm also duplicates a majestic acrostic design using the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. <a ref='Ps 145'>Psalm 145</a> begins the great crescendo of praise that completes the Psalter and might be called “The Final Hallel” ( <a ref='Ps 145-150'>Pss 145–150</a> ). I. Commitment to Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 145:1–2'>145:1–2</a> ) II. God’s Awesome Greatness ( <a ref='Psalms 145:3–7'>145:3–7</a> ) III. God’s Great Grace ( <a ref='Psalms 145:8–13'>145:8–13</a> ) IV. God’s Unfailing Faithfulness ( <a ref='Psalms 145:14–16'>145:14–16</a> ) V.

Recommitment/Exhortation to Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 145:21'>145:21</a> ) <a ref='Psalms 145:1'>145:1</a> <b>my God, O King.</b> David, king of Israel, recognized God as his sovereign (cf. <a ref='Psalms 5:2'>Pss 5:2</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 84:3'>84:3</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 145:11–13'>145:11–13</a> <b>kingdom.</b> David refers here to the broadest use of kingdom in Scripture—i.e., God the eternal king ruling over all from before creation and eternally thereafter (cf. <a ref='Psalms 10:16'>Ps 10:16</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 4:3'>Da 4:3</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 7:27'>7:27</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 145:14–16'>145:14–16</a> The emphasis is on God’s common grace to all of humanity (cf. <a ref='Matthew 5:45'>Mt 5:45</a> ; <a ref='Luke 6:35'>Lk 6:35</a> ; <a ref='Acts 14:17'>Ac 14:17</a> ; <a ref='Acts 17:25'>17:25</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 145:20'>145:20</a> <b>the wicked … destroy.</b> The wicked await an eternity of living forever, away from the presence of God in the lake of fire (cf. <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:9'>2Th 1:9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:11–15'>Rev 20:11–15</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 146:1–10'>146:1–10</a> From this psalm to the conclusion of the Psalter, each psalm begins and ends with “Praise Yah!” ( <a ref='Ps 146-150'>Pss 146–150</a> ). Neither the composer nor the occasions are known. <a ref='Ps 146'>Psalm 146</a> appears similar in content to <a ref='Ps 113'>Pss 113</a> , <a ref='Ps 145'>145</a> . I. Commitment to Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 146:1–2'>146:1–2</a> ) II. Misplaced Trust ( <a ref='Psalms 146:3–4'>146:3–4</a> ) III.

The hard questions that God posed to Job ( <a ref='Job 38-41'>Job 38–41</a> ) and Israel ( <a ref='Is 40'>Is 40</a> ), the psalmist here turns into declarations worthy of praise. Verses <a ref='Psalms 147:1'>1</a> , <a ref='Psalms 147:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Psalms 147:12'>12</a> each introduce a stanza of praise in this 3-part hymn. Verses <a ref='Psalms 147:2–3'>2–3</a> , <a ref='Psalms 147:19–20'>19–20</a> specifically speak of God’s involvement with Israel. I. Praise Yahweh—Part 1 ( <a ref='Psalms 147:1–6'>147:1–6</a> ) II. Praise Yahweh—Part 2 ( <a ref='Psalms 147:7–11'>147:7–11</a> ) III.

God sovereignly oversees the normal and the extraordinary. <a ref='Psalms 147:19–20'>147:19–20</a> The psalmist acknowledges God’s unique election of Israel from among all the nations (cf. <a ref='Genesis 12:1–3'>Ge 12:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 19:5–6'>Ex 19:5–6</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 7:6–8'>Dt 7:6–8</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 14:2'>14:2</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:18–19'>26:18–19</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 7:23–24'>2Sa 7:23–24</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 16:1–7'>Eze 16:1–7</a> ). <a ref='Psalms 148:1–14'>148:1–14</a> <i>See note on <a ref='Psalms 146:1–10'>Ps 146:1–10</a> .</i> The author and background for this psalm, which calls for all of God’s creation to praise Him, is unknown. There is a connection between the creation praising God and His involvement with Israel. I. Heaven’s Praise ( <a ref='Psalms 148:1–6'>148:1–6</a> ) A. Who? ( <a ref='Psalms 148:1–4'>148:1–4</a> ) B.
