Interpreters hold to one of 3 positions: 1) The encounter between the Shunammite woman, the king of Israel, and Gehazi took place toward the end of the reign of Jehoram in Israel. However, this would mean Gehazi was in the presence of the king (vv. 4–5 ), although afflicted with leprosy ( 5:27 ), and King Jehoram was asking what great things Elisha had done after personally witnessing the events recorded in 6:8—7:19 . 2) Because the king of Israel did not know Elisha’s exploits, some interpreters place the final encounter during the early reign of Jehu. However, there are still the issues of Gehazi’s leprosy and Jehu’s being well acquainted with the prophecy of Elijah ( 9:36–37 ; 10:17 ) that predicted Elisha’s ministry ( 1Ki 19:15–18 ). 3) The best explanation is that the record is out of chronological sequence, being thematically tied to the subject of famine in 6:24—7:20 , but having occurred earlier in the reign of King Jehoram of Israel, before the events recorded in 5:1—7:20 ."

Though Hoshea was characterized as a wicked king, it is not stated that he promoted the religious practices of Jeroboam I. In this way, he was some improvement on the kings of Israel who had gone before him. However, this slight improvement did not offset the centuries of sin by Israel’s kings nor divert her inevitable doom."

Judah is included, though her captivity did not occur until 605/604–586 BC at the hands of the Babylonians. Her sins were the same. Here is a very full and impressive vindication of God’s action in punishing His privileged but rebellious and apostate people. In v. 7 , he begins by stating that the Israelites had sinned against Yahweh who had redeemed them from Egypt. Gross perversion of the worship of God and national propensity to idolatry finally exhausted divine patience. The idolatry of Israel is described in vv. 7–12 . In response to Israel’s actions, Yahweh sent His prophets to Israel and Judah with a message of repentance (v. 13 ). However, the people failed to respond to the prophets’ messages, because, like their fathers, they did not have faith in Yahweh (v. 14 ). Their lack of faith resulted in disobedience to Yahweh’s commands and the further pursuit of idolatry (vv. 15–17 ). The idolatry of Israel (and Judah) brought forth the anger of Yahweh, which resulted in exile (v. 18 ). The “great sin” of both Israel and Judah was their continual following of the sinful pattern of Jeroboam I, departing from Yahweh and practicing idolatry, thus bringing down the judgment of captivity predicted by the prophets (vv. 19–23 )."
