Sometimes rendered “remnant,” this term designated the faithful among the Israelites. Paul cited this verse to prove the ongoing existence of faithful Israelites even in his day ( Ro 9:29 ). Such a remnant will constitute the nucleus of returning Israelites in the nation’s regathering when the Messiah returns to earth. See 10:20 , 22 ; Hos 1:10–11 . Sodom … Gomorrah. In destroying them, God rained brimstone and fire on these two Canaanite cities because of their aggravated sinfulness ( Ge 18:20 ; 19:24–25 , 28 ).

Isaiah was saying that the Messiah would bear the consequences of the sins of men, namely the griefs and sorrows of life, though incredibly the Jews who watched Him die thought He was being punished by God for His own sins. Matthew found an analogical fulfillment of these words in Jesus’ healing ministry ( see notes on Mt 8:16–17 ), because sickness results from sin for which the Servant paid with His life (vv. 7–8 ; cf. 1Pe 2:24 ). In eternity, all sickness will be removed, so ultimately it is included in the benefits of the atonement."

Such true seeking in faith is accompanied by repentance, which is described as forsaking ways and thoughts and turning from sinful living to Yahweh. A sinner must come, believing in God, recognizing his sin and desiring forgiveness and deliverance from that sin. At the same time he must recognize his own inability to be righteous or to satisfy God and cast himself on God’s mercy. It is then that he receives a complete pardon. His sin has been covered by the substitution of the Messiah in his place (chap. 53 ). This OT pattern of salvation is illustrated in Lk 18:9–14 ."
