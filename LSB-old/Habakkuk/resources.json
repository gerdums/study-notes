    "content": "The Book of Habakkuk Title This prophetic book takes its name from its author and possibly means “one who embraces” ( <a ref='Habakkuk 1:1'>1:1</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 3:1'>3:1</a> ). By the end of the prophecy, this name becomes appropriate as the prophet clings to God regardless of his confusion about God’s plans for His people. Author and Date As with many of the Minor Prophets, nothing is known about the prophet except that which can be inferred from the book. In the case of Habakkuk, internal information is virtually nonexistent, making conclusions about his identity and life conjectural. His simple introduction as “Habakkuk the prophet” may imply that he needed no introduction since he was a well-known prophet of his day. It is certain that he was a contemporary of Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zephaniah. The mention of the Chaldeans ( <a ref='Habakkuk 1:6'>1:6</a> ) suggests a late seventh century BC date, shortly before Nebuchadnezzar commenced his military march through Nineveh (612 BC), Haran (609 BC), and Carchemish (605 BC), on his way to Jerusalem (605 BC). Habakkuk’s bitter lament ( <a ref='Habakkuk 1:2–4'>1:2–4</a> ) may reflect a time period shortly after the death of Josiah (609 BC), days in which the godly king’s reforms (cf. <a ref='2Ki 23'>2Ki 23</a> ) were quickly overturned by his successor, Jehoiakim ( <a ref='Jeremiah 22:13–19'>Jer 22:13–19</a> ). Background and Setting Habakkuk prophesied during the final days of the Assyrian Empire and the beginning of Babylonia’s world rulership under Nabopolassar and his son Nebuchadnezzar. When Nabopolassar ascended to power in 626 BC, he immediately began to expand his influence to the north and west. Under the leadership of his son, the Babylonian army overthrew Nineveh in 612 BC, forcing the Assyrian nobility to take refuge first in Haran and then Carchemish. Nebuchadnezzar pursued them, overrunning Haran in 609 BC and Carchemish in 605 BC. The Egyptian king Neco, traveling through Judah in 609 BC to assist the fleeing Assyrian king, was opposed by King Josiah at Megiddo ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 35:20–24'>2Chr 35:20–24</a> ). Josiah was killed in the ensuing battle, leaving his throne to a succession of 3 sons and a grandson. Earlier, as a result of discovering the Book of the Law in the temple (622 BC), Josiah had instituted significant spiritual reforms in Judah ( <a ref='2Ki 22-23'>2Ki 22–23</a> ), abolishing many of the idolatrous practices of his father Amon ( <a ref='2 Kings 21:20–22'>2Ki 21:20–22</a> ) and grandfather Manasseh ( <a ref='2 Kings 21:11–13'>2Ki 21:11–13</a> ). Upon his death, however, the nation quickly reverted to her evil ways (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 22:13–19'>Jer 22:13–19</a> ), causing Habakkuk to question God’s silence and apparent lack of punitive action ( <a ref='Habakkuk 1:2–4'>1:2–4</a> ) to purge His covenant people. Historical and Theological Themes The opening verses reveal a historical situation similar to the days of Amos and Micah. Justice had essentially disappeared from the Land; violence and wickedness were pervasive, existing unchecked. In the midst of these dark days, the prophet cried out for divine intervention ( <a ref='Habakkuk 1:2–4'>1:2–4</a> ). God’s response, that He was sending the Chaldeans to judge Judah ( <a ref='Habakkuk 1:5–11'>1:5–11</a> ), creates an even greater theological dilemma for Habakkuk: Why didn’t God purge His people and restore their righteousness? How could God use the Chaldeans to judge a people more righteous than they ( <a ref='Habakkuk 1:12–2:1'>1:12—2:1</a> )? God’s answer that He would also judge the Chaldeans also ( <a ref='Habakkuk 2:2–20'>2:2–20</a> ) did not fully satisfy the prophet’s theological quandary; in fact, it only intensified it. In Habakkuk’s mind, the issue crying for resolution is no longer God’s righteous response toward evil (or lack thereof), but the vindication of God’s character and covenant with His people ( <a ref='Habakkuk 1:13'>1:13</a> ). Like Job, the prophet argued with God, and through that experience he achieved a deeper understanding of God’s sovereign character and a firmer faith in Him (cf. <a ref='Job 42:5–6'>Job 42:5–6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 55:8–9'>Is 55:8–9</a> ). Ultimately, Habakkuk realized that God was not to be worshiped merely because of the temporal blessings He bestowed, but for His own sake ( <a ref='Habakkuk 3:17–19'>3:17–19</a> ). Interpretive Challenges The queries of the prophet represent some of the most fundamental questions in all of life, with the answers providing crucial foundation stones on which to build a proper understanding of God’s character and His sovereign ways in history. The core of his message lies in the call to trust God ( <a ref='Habakkuk 2:4'>2:4</a> ), “the righteous will live by his faith.” The NT references ascribe unusual importance theologically to Habakkuk. The writer of Hebrews quotes <a ref='Habakkuk 2:4'>Hab 2:4</a> to amplify the believer’s need to remain strong and faithful in the midst of affliction and trials ( <a ref='Hebrews 10:38'>Heb 10:38</a> ). The apostle Paul, on the other hand, employs the verse twice ( <a ref='Romans 1:17'>Ro 1:17</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:11'>Ga 3:11</a> ) to accentuate the doctrine of justification by faith. There need not be any interpretive conflict, however, for the emphasis in both Habakkuk and the NT references goes beyond the act of faith to include the continuity of faith. Faith is not a one-time act, but a way of life. The true believer, declared righteous by God, will habitually persevere in faith throughout all his life (cf. <a ref='Colossians 1:22–23'>Col 1:22–23</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 3:12–14'>Heb 3:12–14</a> ). He will trust the sovereign God who only does what is right. Outline I. Superscription ( <a ref='Habakkuk 1:1'>1:1</a> ) II. The Prophet’s Perplexities ( <a ref='Habakkuk 1:2–2:20'>1:2—2:20</a> ) A.

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Habakkuk 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>oracle.</b> A weighty oracle of judgment (cf. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:5–11'>1:5–11</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 2:2–20'>2:2–20</a> ) is often depicted by this term when employed by the prophets to announce God’s wrath against sin (e.g., <a ref='Isaiah 13:1'>Is 13:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 15:1'>15:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 17:1'>17:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 19:1'>19:1</a> ; <a ref='Nahum 1:1'>Na 1:1</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 9:1'>Zec 9:1</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 12:1'>12:1</a> ; <a ref='Malachi 1:1'>Mal 1:1</a> ). <b>beheld.</b> God’s message to Habakkuk took the form of a vision. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:2–4'>1:2–4</a> In Habakkuk’s first complaint, he perceived that God appeared indifferent to Judah’s sin. Jealous for His righteousness and knowing that a breach of the covenant required judgment (cf. <a ref='De 28'>Dt 28</a> ), Habakkuk questioned God’s wisdom, expressing bewilderment at His seeming inactivity in the face of blatant violation of His law. The Jews had sinned by violence and injustice and should have been punished by the same. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>How long … will I call.</b> The phrase, reflecting the prophet’s impatience, is frequently used by the psalmist to express similar thoughts of perplexity (cf. <a ref='Psalms 13:1–2'>Pss 13:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 62:3'>62:3</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 14:9'>Jer 14:9</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 27:46'>Mt 27:46</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 1:2–3'>1:2–3</a> <b>Violence … wickedness … trouble … devastation.</b> Judah’s society is defined with 4 terms denoting malicious wickedness by which one morally and ethically oppresses his neighbor, resulting in contention and strife. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>Yet You do not save.</b> The prophet wanted a cleansing, purging, chastening, and revival among the people that would return them to righteousness. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>law is ignored.</b> Lit. the “law is chilled, numbed” (cf. <a ref='Genesis 45:26'>Ge 45:26</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 77:2'>Ps 77:2</a> ). It had no respect, was given no authority. As hands rendered useless by cold, the impact and effectiveness of the law were paralyzed by the corruption of Judah’s leaders (cf. <a ref='Ecclesiastes 8:11'>Ecc 8:11</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 1:5–11'>1:5–11</a> In response to Habakkuk’s perplexity and pleading, God broke His silence, informing him that He was not indifferent to Judah’s sin; but rather than revival, He was sending the “dreaded and feared” judgment (v. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:7'>7</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>See … look … Be astonished!</b> The series of commands is plural, indicating that the wider community of Judah and Jerusalem was to take note of this imminent invasion. Paul quotes this text in <a ref='Acts 13:41'>Ac 13:41</a> . <a ref='Habakkuk 1:6–8'>1:6–8</a> The Chaldeans (Babylonians) would come at the behest of the divine Commander. He is the Sovereign who brings this people of ruthless character and conduct to invade Judah. The Chaldeans are described as self-assured, self-sufficient, self-deified, and deadly (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:20'>Jer 51:20</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>wolves in the evening.</b> These were wolves who had suffered hunger all day long and were forced to prowl into the night for food. Like wolves, Babylon’s army displayed extraordinary stamina and an undaunted eagerness to attack for the purpose of devouring the spoils of victory. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:10'>1:10</a> Whether it be royal authority or physical obstacles, the Babylonian army marched forward with nothing but scorn for those in their path. <b>heap up dirt.</b> Rubble and dirt piled up against the fortress or city wall as a ramp to gain entry. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>power is their god.</b> Though the Chaldeans were God’s instruments of judgment, their self-sufficiency and self-adulation planted the seeds for their own destruction (described in <a ref='Habakkuk 2:2–20'>2:2–20</a> ), as they stood guilty of idolatry and blasphemy before the sovereign Lord. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:12–2:1'>1:12—2:1</a> Habakkuk, in his reaction to the perplexing revelation (vv. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:5–11'>5–11</a> ), declared his confidence in Yahweh (v. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:12'>12</a> ), then unveiled his second complaint, namely, how could Yahweh use a wicked nation (the Chaldeans) to judge a nation (Judah) more righteous than they (vv. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:13–17'>13–17</a> )? The prophet ended by expressing his determination to wait for an answer ( <a ref='Habakkuk 2:1'>2:1</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>O Yahweh, my God, my Holy One.</b> Although the prophet could not fully comprehend the sovereign workings of his righteous God, he expressed his complete faith and trust. As he rehearsed the unchangeable character of God as eternal, sovereign, and holy, he became assured that Judah would not be completely destroyed (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 31:35–40'>Jer 31:35–40</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 33:23–26'>33:23–26</a> ). Under the faithful hand of God, he realized that the Chaldeans were coming to correct, not annihilate. <b>O Rock.</b> A title for God which expresses His immovable and unshakable character (cf. <a ref='Psalms 18:2'>Pss 18:2</a> , <a ref='Psalms 18:31'>31</a> , <a ref='Psalms 18:46'>46</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 31:2–3'>31:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 62:2'>62:2</a> , <a ref='Psalms 62:6–7'>6–7</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 78:16'>78:16</a> , <a ref='Psalms 78:20'>20</a> , <a ref='Psalms 78:35'>35</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>eyes are too pure.</b> In spite of the prophet’s expressions of faith and trust, he found himself in even further perplexity. The essence of Habakkuk’s next quandary is expressed in this verse: If God is too pure to behold evil, then how can He use the wicked to devour a person more righteous than they? Would not God’s use of the Chaldeans result in even greater damage to His righteous character? <a ref='Habakkuk 1:14–17'>1:14–17</a> Lest God had forgotten just how wicked the Chaldeans were, Habakkuk drew attention to their evil character and behavior. Life was cheap to the Chaldeans. In the face of their ruthless tactics of war, other societies were “like the fish of the sea, like creeping things without a ruler.” In light of their reputation (vv. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:6–10'>6–10</a> ), how could God have unleashed this ruthless force upon another helpless people? <a ref='Habakkuk 1:16'>1:16</a> <b>sacrifice … burn incense to their fishing net.</b> If that is not enough, the prophet added that they attributed their gain to their own military might rather than to the true God. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:17'>1:17</a> <b>empty their net.</b> How long will the aggressor (the Chaldeans) be permitted to pursue injustice and engage in such wickedness? Can God tolerate it indefinitely? <a ref='Habakkuk 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>stand on my guard post.</b> Comparing himself to a watchman (cf. <a ref='Eze 3'>Eze 3</a> , <a ref='Eze 33'>33</a> ), standing as a sentinel upon the city walls, Habakkuk prepared to wait for God’s answer and to ponder his reply. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:2–20'>2:2–20</a> In response to Habakkuk’s second complaint ( <a ref='Habakkuk 1:12–2:1'>1:12—2:1</a> ), Yahweh announced that He would judge the Chaldeans as well for their wickedness. His reply included: 1) the instructions to write it down, as a reminder that it would surely occur (vv. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:2–3'>2–3</a> ); 2) a description of the character of the wicked in comparison to the righteous (vv. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:4–5'>4–5</a> ); and 3) the pronouncement of 5 woes describing the Chaldeans’ demise (vv. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:6–20'>6–20</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 2:2–3'>2:2–3</a> <b>Write down the vision.</b> Habakkuk was to record the vision to preserve it for posterity, so that all who read it would know of the certainty of its fulfillment (cf. similar language in <a ref='Daniel 12:4'>Da 12:4</a> , <a ref='Daniel 12:9'>9</a> ). The prophecy had lasting relevance and thus had to be preserved. Although a period of time would occur before its fulfillment, all were to know that it would occur at God’s “appointed time” (cf. <a ref='Is 13'>Is 13</a> ; <a ref='Je 50-51'>Jer 50–51</a> ). Babylon would fall to the Medo-Persian kingdom of Cyrus ca. 539 BC (cf. <a ref='Da 5'>Da 5</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>That the one who reads it may run.</b> Perhaps referring 1) to clarity of form, so even the one who runs by it may easily absorb its meaning, or 2) to clarity of content, so that the courier could easily transmit the message to others. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:4'>2:4</a> <b>the proud one.</b> While the context makes this an obvious reference to the Chaldeans, the passage introduces the marks which distinguish all wicked from all righteous, regardless of ethnic origin. Two opposing characteristics are here contrasted. The proud trusts in himself; the just lives by his faith. <b>the righteous will live by his faith.</b> In contrast to the proud, the righteous will be truly preserved through his faithfulness to God. This is the core of God’s message to/through Habakkuk. Both the aspect of justification by faith, as noted by Paul’s usage in <a ref='Romans 1:17'>Ro 1:17</a> and <a ref='Galatians 3:11'>Ga 3:11</a> , as well as the aspect of sanctification by faith, as employed by the writer of Hebrews ( <a ref='Hebrews 10:38'>10:38</a> ), reflect the essence of Habakkuk; no conflict exists. The emphasis in both Habakkuk and the NT references goes beyond the act of faith to include the continuity of faith. Faith is not a one-time act, but a way of life. The true believer, declared righteous by God, will persevere in faith as the pattern of his life (cf. <a ref='Colossians 1:22–23'>Col 1:22–23</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 3:12–14'>Heb 3:12–14</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 2:5'>2:5</a> The diatribe against the Chaldeans served as the basis for the denunciations described in vv. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:6–20'>6–20</a> . They were proud and greedy. Like Sheol and death (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 1:12'>Pr 1:12</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 27:20'>27:20</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 30:15–16'>30:15–16</a> ), they were never satisfied but always wanted more. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:6–20'>2:6–20</a> Five woes, in the form of a taunt song, were pronounced upon the Chaldeans in anticipation of their eventual judgment. Presented in 5 stanzas of 3 verses each, the 5 woes were directed at 5 different classes of evildoers. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:6–8'>2:6–8</a> The first woe charged extortion, i.e., plundering nations under threat of great bodily harm for the purpose of making themselves rich. As a result, they were to become plunder for those nations who remained. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:6'>2:6</a> <b>all of these.</b> A reference to all the nations who suffered at the hands of the Babylonians. <b>Woe.</b> An interjection often used in prophetic literature to introduce a judicial indictment or a sentence of judgment ( <a ref='Isaiah 5:8'>Is 5:8</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 5:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 5:18'>18</a> , <a ref='Isaiah 5:20–22'>20–22</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 22:13'>Jer 22:13</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:1'>23:1</a> ; <a ref='Amos 5:18'>Am 5:18</a> ; <a ref='Amos 6:1'>6:1</a> ). <b>loans.</b> The Babylonians exacted heavy taxation of conquered nations. Such action often accompanied loans with excessive interest made to the poor (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:10–13'>Dt 24:10–13</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 4:1–7'>2Ki 4:1–7</a> ; <a ref='Nehemiah 5:1–13'>Ne 5:1–13</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>your creditors.</b> The survivor nations, from whom taxation was extorted (cf. v. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:8'>8</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 2:9–11'>2:9–11</a> The second charge, of premeditated exploitation borne out of covetousness, was a continuation of vv. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:6–8'>6–8</a> . The walls of their houses, built with stones and timbers taken from others, testified against them (v. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:11'>11</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 2:9'>2:9</a> <b>put his nest on high.</b> Wanting to protect themselves from any recriminations their enemies might seek to shower upon them, the Chaldeans had sought to make their cities impregnable and inaccessible to the enemy (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 14:13–14'>Is 14:13–14</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 2:10'>2:10</a> <b>You have counseled a shameful thing.</b> The Chaldean leaders, by counseling to kill, shamed themselves and harmed their souls. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:12–14'>2:12–14</a> The third woe accuses them of being ruthless despots, building luxurious palaces by means of bloodshed and forced labor. Like a fire that burns everything given to it, their labors would all be futile, having no lasting value (v. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:13'>13</a> ; cf. <a ref='Micah 3:10'>Mic 3:10</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 2:14'>2:14</a> <b>filled.</b> In contrast to the self-exaltation of the Chaldeans, whose efforts come to naught, God promised that the whole earth would recognize His glory at the establishment of His millennial kingdom (cf. <a ref='Numbers 14:21'>Nu 14:21</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 72:19'>Ps 72:19</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 6:3'>Is 6:3</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:9'>11:9</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 2:15–17'>2:15–17</a> The fourth charge is debauchery, wherein Babylon forced others to become intoxicated and poisoned, making them behave shamefully and become easy prey. As a result, they too would be forced to drink the cup of God’s wrath and exposed to public shame (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 49:12'>Jer 49:12</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 2:16'>2:16</a> <b>nakedness.</b> This word refers to “foreskin,” expressing in Hebrew thought the greatest contempt, the sign of being an alien from God. <i>See note on <a ref='Jeremiah 4:4'>Jer 4:4</a> .</i> <b>cup in Yahweh’s right hand.</b> A metaphor referring to divine retribution, served up by His powerful right hand (cf. <a ref='Psalms 21:8'>Ps 21:8</a> ). What the Chaldeans did to others would also be done to them (vv. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:7–8'>7–8</a> ). <b>disgrace</b> will come <b>upon your glory.</b> Carrying out the metaphor of drunkenness, here is a reference to the humiliation of “shameful spewing.” The very thing in which they gloried would become the object of their shame. While Yahweh’s glory would be “as the waters cover the sea” (v. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:14'>14</a> ), Babylon’s glory would be covered with shame. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:17'>2:17</a> <b>violence.</b> The reference may be to the ruthless exploitation of trees and animals, providing building materials, firewood, and food, which often accompanied military campaigns. Lebanon’s beautiful cedars were plundered for selfish purposes (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 14:7–8'>Is 14:7–8</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 37:24'>37:24</a> ). It also includes the slaughter of men. Verse <a ref='Habakkuk 2:17'>17b</a> suggests that it may symbolize Israel and her inhabitants, whom Nebuchadnezzar conquered (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 14:9'>2Ki 14:9</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 22:6'>Jer 22:6</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 22:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 17:3'>Eze 17:3</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 2:18–20'>2:18–20</a> The fifth accusation is idolatry, exposing the folly of following other gods (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 41:24'>Is 41:24</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 44:9'>44:9</a> ). The destruction of the Chaldeans would demonstrate the superiority of Yahweh over all gods. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:19'>2:19</a> <b>Awake! … Arise!</b> Compare the sarcasm with that of Elijah’s words to the prophets of Baal on Mt. Carmel ( <a ref='1 Kings 18:27'>1Ki 18:27</a> ; cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 2:27'>Jer 2:27</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 2:20'>2:20</a> <b>holy temple.</b> A reference to heaven, from where Yahweh rules ( <a ref='Psalms 11:4'>Ps 11:4</a> ) and answers the prayers of those who seek Him ( <a ref='1 Kings 8:28–30'>1Ki 8:28–30</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 73:17'>Ps 73:17</a> ). <b>be silent.</b> In contrast to the silence of the idols (v. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:19'>19</a> ), the living, Sovereign Ruler of the universe calls all the earth to be silent before Him. None can assert his independence from Him; all the earth must worship in humble submission (cf. <a ref='Psalms 46:10'>Ps 46:10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 52:15'>Is 52:15</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 3:1–19'>3:1–19</a> The reference to “Habakkuk the prophet” (cf. <a ref='Habakkuk 1:1'>1:1</a> ) marks a transition. The argumentative tone of the previous chapters, in which he cried for divine interference, is transformed into a plea for God’s mercy (v. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:2'>2</a> ), a review of God’s power (vv. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:3–15'>3–15</a> ), and a chorus of praise for God’s sustaining grace and sufficiency (vv. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:16–19'>16–19</a> ). But while the tone changes, a strong, thematic connection remains. Having been informed of God’s plan of judgment, Habakkuk returns to the matter of Judah’s judgment, pleading for mercy. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:1'>3:1</a> <b>Shigionoth.</b> The precise meaning is unknown (its singular form occurs in the heading to <a ref='Ps 7'>Ps 7</a> ). In light of the musical notation at the end of chap. <a ref='Hab 3'>3</a> , it is thought that it has a musical-liturgical significance, and that this chapter was sung. Other Psalms of the Bible 1. “The Song of Deliverance” <a ref='Exodus 15:1–18'>Exodus 15:1–18</a> 2. “The Song of Moses” <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:1–43'>Deuteronomy 32:1–43</a> 3. “The Song of Deborah” <a ref='Judges 5:1–31'>Judges 5:1–31</a> 4. “The Song of Hannah” <a ref='1 Samuel 2:1–10'>1 Samuel 2:1–10</a> 5. “The Song of the Women” <a ref='1 Samuel 18:6–7'>1 Samuel 18:6–7</a> 6. “The Song of David” <a ref='2 Samuel 22:1–51'>2 Samuel 22:1–51</a> 7. “The Song of Hezekiah” <a ref='Isaiah 38:9–20'>Isaiah 38:9–20</a> 8. “The Song of Jonah” <a ref='Jonah 2:1–9'>Jonah 2:1–9</a> 9. “The Song of Habakkuk” <a ref='Habakkuk 3:1–19'>Habakkuk 3:1–19</a> 10. “The Song of Mary” <a ref='Luke 1:46–55'>Luke 1:46–55</a> Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Habakkuk 3:2'>3:2</a> <b>the report about You.</b> A reference back to <a ref='Habakkuk 1:5–11'>1:5–11</a> and <a ref='Habakkuk 2:2–20'>2:2–20</a> , where Yahweh informed Habakkuk of His plans for judging Judah and the Chaldeans. <b>revive Your work.</b> Knowledge of the severity of God’s judgment struck Habakkuk with fear. As though God’s power had not been used in a long time, the prophet asked Yahweh to “revive” (lit. “to quicken”), to repeat His mighty saving works on behalf of His people, Israel. <b>In the midst of the years.</b> In the midst of His punishment of Judah at the hand of the Chaldeans, the prophet begged that God would remember mercy. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:3–15'>3:3–15</a> Employing figures from God’s past intervention on Israel’s behalf, taken from the deliverance of His people from Egypt and the conquest of Canaan, Habakkuk painted a picture of their future redemption. The Exodus from Egypt is often used as an analogy of the future redemption of Israel at the beginning of the Millennium (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 11:16'>Is 11:16</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 3:3'>3:3</a> <b>Teman … Mount Paran.</b> Teman, named after a grandson of Esau, was an Edomite city ( <a ref='Amos 1:12'>Am 1:12</a> ; <a ref='Obadiah 1:9'>Ob 9</a> ). Mount Paran was located in the Sinai peninsula. Both allude to the theater in which God displayed great power when He brought Israel into the land of Canaan (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 33:2'>Dt 33:2</a> ; <a ref='Judges 5:4'>Jdg 5:4</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 3:3–4'>3:3–4</a> The Shekinah glory, which protected and led Israel from Egypt through the wilderness (cf. <a ref='Exodus 40:34–38'>Ex 40:34–38</a> ), was the physical manifestation of His presence. Like the sun, He spread His radiance throughout the heavens and the earth. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:5'>3:5</a> <b>pestilence … plague.</b> Recalling the judgment attending Israel’s disobedience to the covenant given at Sinai ( <a ref='Exodus 5:3'>Ex 5:3</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 14:12'>Nu 14:12</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:21–22'>Dt 28:21–22</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:24'>32:24</a> ), Habakkuk accentuated the sovereign agency of God’s judgments. Both were a part of the divine entourage. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:6–7'>3:6–7</a> The entire universe responds in fear at the approach of Almighty God (cf. <a ref='Exodus 15:14'>Ex 15:14</a> ). As at the Creation ( <a ref='Isaiah 40:12'>Is 40:12</a> ), the earth and its inhabitants are at His disposal. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:7'>3:7</a> <b>Cushan … Midian.</b> Probably referring to one people living in the Sinai peninsula region (cf. <a ref='Exodus 2:16–22'>Ex 2:16–22</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 18:1–5'>18:1–5</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 12:1'>Nu 12:1</a> , where Moses’ wife was identified as being both Midianite and Cushite). <a ref='Habakkuk 3:8–15'>3:8–15</a> With rhetorical vividness, Habakkuk addressed Yahweh directly, rehearsing His judicial actions against anything that opposes His will. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:8'>3:8</a> <b>Your horses … Your chariots.</b> Symbolic descriptions of God defeating the enemy (cf. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:11'>3:11</a> , <a ref='Habakkuk 3:15'>15</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 3:9'>3:9</a> <b>Rods were sworn</b> unto battle <b>by word.</b> Yahweh’s arrows were commissioned under divine oaths (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 47:6–7'>Jer 47:6–7</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 3:11'>3:11</a> <b>Sun</b> and <b>moon stood in their lofty places.</b> As prominent symbols of God’s created order, the sun and moon are subservient to His beckoning. The imagery is reminiscent of Israel’s victory over the Amorites at Gibeon ( <a ref='Joshua 10:12–14'>Jos 10:12–14</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 3:12'>3:12</a> <b>trampled.</b> Lit. “threshed,” the term is often used to depict military invasions and the execution of judgment (cf. <a ref='Judges 8:7'>Jdg 8:7</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 13:7'>2Ki 13:7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 21:10'>Is 21:10</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 25:10'>25:10</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 7:23'>Da 7:23</a> ; <a ref='Amos 1:3'>Am 1:3</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 3:13'>3:13</a> <b>salvation with Your anointed.</b> Both the parallelism with v. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:13'>13a</a> (“Your people”) and the numerous contextual allusions to the Exodus make this a likely reference to Moses and the chosen people of Israel, who, as God’s anointed, achieved victory over Pharaoh and the armies of Egypt (cf. <a ref='Psalms 105:15'>Ps 105:15</a> ). Ultimately, it foreshadows a subsequent, future deliverance in anticipation of the Messiah (cf. <a ref='Psalms 132:10–12'>Ps 132:10–12</a> ) promised in the Davidic Covenant (cf. <a ref='2 Samuel 7:11–16'>2Sa 7:11–16</a> ). <b>crushed the head of the house of the wicked.</b> Possible reference to either the pharaoh of the Exodus, whose firstborn was slain, or to the king of the Chaldeans, whose house was built by unjust gain ( <a ref='Habakkuk 2:9–11'>2:9–11</a> ). <a ref='Habakkuk 3:14'>3:14</a> <b>They stormed in to scatter.</b> A possible reference to the pursuit of fleeing Israel at the Red Sea by Pharaoh’s army ( <a ref='Exodus 14:5–9'>Ex 14:5–9</a> ). Like the poor, Israel appeared to be easy prey for the pursuing Egyptians. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:15'>3:15</a> <b>You tread on the sea.</b> Another reference to God’s miraculous, protective intervention on behalf of Israel at the Red Sea. The historical event demonstrates His sovereign rulership of the universe and provides assurance to the troubled prophet that Yahweh could be counted on to save His people once more. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:16–19'>3:16–19</a> Habakkuk ended the prophecy with renewed commitment and affirmation of faith, expressing unwavering confidence in God. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:16'>3:16</a> <b>wait quietly.</b> Yahweh had answered his prayer (v. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:1'>1</a> ); Yahweh would vindicate His righteousness and ultimately restore a truly repentant people (cf. <a ref='Habakkuk 2:4'>2:4</a> ). While the answer satisfied Habakkuk, the thought of a Chaldean invasion of his people has also left him physically exhausted and overwhelmed (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 4:19'>Jer 4:19</a> ). Nevertheless, the prophet could “wait quietly for the day of distress” because he knew Yahweh would judge righteously. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:17–18'>3:17–18</a> <b>I will exult in Yahweh.</b> If everything that was normal and predictable collapsed, the prophet would still rejoice. Obedience to the covenant was a requisite element to the enjoyment of agricultural and pastoral prosperity ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:1–14'>Dt 28:1–14</a> ). Though disobedience would initiate the covenant curses ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:31–34'>Dt 28:31–34</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:49–51'>49–51</a> ), the prophet affirmed his commitment to Yahweh; his longing and joyful desire was for God Himself. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:19'>3:19</a> <b>Yahweh, Yahweh, is my strength.</b> God’s response to Habakkuk’s perplexities not only promised divine wrath but also provided assurance of divine favor and hope. Security and hope were not based on temporal blessings but on Yahweh Himself. This is the essence of <a ref='Habakkuk 2:4'>2:4</a> : “the righteous will live by his faith.” <b>like hinds’</b> feet. As the sure-footed hind, or deer, scaled the precipitous mountain heights without slipping, so Habakkuk’s faith in Yahweh enabled him to endure the hardships of the imminent invasion, and all of his perplexing questions. <b>For the choir director.</b> <a ref='Hab 3'>Habakkuk 3</a> possibly served as a psalm for temple worship (cf. <a ref='Habakkuk 3:1'>3:1</a> ).",
