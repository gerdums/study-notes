They were not self-centered, but concentrated on God’s kingdom. Their focus was not on personal comfort, fulfillment, and happiness, but on the glory of God and the fulfillment of His purposes. They were not moaning about the injustice of their persecutions. Rather, they were patiently enduring the sufferings they did not deserve (v. 4 ). This very attitude was positive proof that God’s wise process of purging, purifying, and perfecting through suffering was working to make His beloved people worthy of the kingdom (cf. 2:12 ) by being perfected (cf. Jas 1:2–4 ; 1Pe 5:10 ). For believers, afflictions are to be expected (cf. 1Th 3:3 ) as they live and develop Christian character in a satanic world. Suffering is not to be thought of as evidence that God has forsaken them, but evidence that He is with them, perfecting them (cf. Mt 5:10 ; Ro 8:18 ; 2Co 12:10 ). So the Thessalonians demonstrated that their salvation, determined by faith alone in the Lord Jesus Christ, was genuine because they, like Christ, were willing to suffer on account of God and His kingdom. They suffered unjustly as objects of man’s wrath against Christ and His kingdom ( Ac 5:41 ; Php 3:10 ; Col 1:24 ). “Kingdom of God” is used here in its spiritual sense of salvation ( see note on Mt 3:2 )."

He, like the Thessalonians, hoped for that ultimate rest and reward for their suffering for the kingdom that was to come when Christ returned to judge the ungodly. The Lord Jesus promised this twofold coming for rest and retribution (cf. Mt 13:40–43 ; 24:39–41 ; 25:31–33 ; Lk 21:27–28 , 34–36 ; Jn 5:24–29 ). at the revelation of the Lord Jesus.

This term has been used of an earthquake ( Ac 16:26 ) and a ship at anchor slipping its mooring in the midst of a heavy wind. Along with the word “alarmed,” it describes the state of agitation and alarm that had gripped the church. They were greatly distressed because they had expected the Rapture, the gathering together to the Lord, to take place before the day of the Lord. They had expected to be taken to glory and heavenly rest, not left to persecution and divine wrath. Paul must have taught them that they would miss the day of the Lord ( 1Th 5:2–5 ; cf. Rev 3:10 ), but they had become confused by the persecution they were experiencing, thinking they may have been in the day of the Lord. This error had been reinforced by some messages to them claiming that they were indeed in the day of the Lord. Paul noted the source of these as “spirit,” “word,” and “letter.” A “spirit” would most likely refer to a false prophet claiming divine revelation as in 1Jn 4:1–3 . A “word” would refer to a sermon or speech given, while a “letter” indicated a written report. The powerful but harmful effect of this false information was gained by claiming it was from the apostle Paul (“as if from us”). Whoever was telling them they were in the day of the Lord claimed that it came from Paul who heard it, preached it, and wrote it. Thus their lie was given supposed apostolic sanction. The result was shock, fear, and alarm. Obviously, they had expected the Rapture before the day of the Lord. For if they had expected it after, they would have rejoiced because Christ’s coming was to be soon. Apostolic authenticity in this letter which corrects the error was important and accounts for Paul’s care to close the letter in his distinctive handwriting ( 3:17 ; cf. Ga 6:11 ). the day of the Lord. See note on 1Th 5:2 for discussion of this “day.” The idea that the day of the Lord had already come conflicted with what Paul had previously taught them about the Rapture. This error, which so upset the Thessalonians, is what Paul corrected in vv. 3–12 , where he showed that the day hadn’t come and couldn’t until certain realities were in place, most especially “the man of lawlessness” (v. 3 )."

The day of the Lord cannot occur until a deliberate abandonment of a formerly professed position, allegiance, or commitment occurs (the term was used to refer to military, political, or religious rebellion). Some have suggested, on questionable linguistic evidence, that this refers to “departure” in the sense of the Rapture. Context, however, points to a religious defection, which is further described in v. 4 . The language indicates a specific event, not general apostasy which exists now and always will. Rather, Paul has in mind the apostasy. This is an event which is clearly and specifically identifiable and unique, the consummate act of rebellion, an event of final magnitude. The key to identifying the event is to identify the main person, which Paul does, calling him the “man of lawlessness.” Some texts have “man of sin,” but there is no real difference in meaning since sin equals lawlessness ( 1Jn 3:4 ). This is the one who is called “the prince who is to come” ( Da 9:26 ) and “the little horn” ( Da 7:8 ), whom John calls “the beast” ( Rev 13:2–10 , 18 ) and most know as the Antichrist. The context and language clearly identify a real person in future times who actually does the things prophesied of him in Scripture. He is also called “the son of perdition” or destruction, a term used of Judas Iscariot ( Jn 17:12 ). This “apostasy” is the abomination of desolation that takes place at the midpoint of the Tribulation, spoken of in Da 9:27 ; 11:31 and Mt 24:15 ( see notes there ). This man is not Satan, although Satan is the force behind him (v. 9 ), and he has motives like the desires of the devil (cf. Is 14:13–14 ). Paul is referring to the very act of ultimate apostasy which reveals the final Antichrist and sets the course for the events that usher in the day of the Lord. Apparently, he will be seen as supportive of religion so that God and Christ will not appear as his enemies until the apostasy. He exalts himself and opposes God by moving into the temple, the place for worship of God, declaring himself to be God and demanding the worship of the world. In this act of Satanic self-deification, he commits the great apostasy in defiance of God. For the first 3 1/2 years of the Tribulation, he maintains relations with Israel, but halts those (cf. Da 9:27 ); and for the last 3 1/2 years, there is great tribulation under his reign (cf. Da 7:25 ; 11:36–39 ; Mt 24:15–21 ; Rev 13:1–8 ) culminating with the day of the Lord."

Whatever now restrains the Antichrist of vv. 3–4 , 8–10 from being revealed in the fullness of his apostasy and evil must be more than human or even angelic power. The power that holds back Satan from bringing the final apostasy and unveiling of his Satan-possessed false Christ must be divinely supernatural. It must be God’s power in operation that holds back Satan, so that the man of sin, the son of destruction, won’t be able to come until God permits it by removing the restraining power. The reason for the restraint was so that Antichrist would be revealed at God’s appointed time and no sooner, just as was Christ (cf. Ga 4:4 ), because God controls Satan."
