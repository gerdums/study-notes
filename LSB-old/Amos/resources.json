    "content": "The Book of Amos Title As with each of the Minor Prophets, the title comes from the name of the prophet to whom God gave His message ( <a ref='Amos 1:1'>1:1</a> ). Amos’ name means “burden” or “burden-bearer.” He is not to be confused with Amoz (“stout, strong”), the father of Isaiah ( <a ref='Isaiah 1:1'>Is 1:1</a> ). Author and Date Amos was from Tekoa, a small village 10 mi. south of Jerusalem. He was the only prophet to give his occupation before declaring his divine commission. He was not of priestly or noble descent, but worked as a “sheepherder” ( <a ref='Amos 1:1'>1:1</a> ; cf. <a ref='2 Kings 3:4'>2Ki 3:4</a> ) and a “grower of sycamore figs” ( <a ref='Amos 7:14'>7:14</a> ) and was a contemporary of Jonah ( <a ref='2 Kings 14:25'>2Ki 14:25</a> ), Hosea ( <a ref='Hosea 1:1'>Hos 1:1</a> ), and Isaiah ( <a ref='Isaiah 1:1'>Is 1:1</a> ). The date of writing is mid-eighth century BC, during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (ca. 790–739 BC) and Jeroboam II, king of Israel (ca. 793–753 BC), two years before a memorable earthquake ( <a ref='Amos 1:1'>1:1</a> ; cf. <a ref='Zechariah 14:5'>Zec 14:5</a> ). Background and Setting Amos was a Judean prophet called to deliver a message primarily to the northern tribes of Israel ( <a ref='Amos 7:15'>7:15</a> ). Politically, it was a time of prosperity under the long and secure reign of Jeroboam II who, following the example of his father Joash ( <a ref='2 Kings 13:25'>2Ki 13:25</a> ), significantly “restored the border of Israel” ( <a ref='2 Kings 14:25'>2Ki 14:25</a> ). It was also a time of peace with both Judah (cf. <a ref='Amos 5:5'>5:5</a> ) and her more distant neighbors; the ever-present menace of Assyria was subdued, possibly because of Nineveh’s repentance at the preaching of Jonah ( <a ref='Jonah 3:10'>Jon 3:10</a> ). Spiritually, however, it was a time of rampant corruption and moral decay ( <a ref='Amos 4:1'>4:1</a> ; <a ref='Amos 5:10–13'>5:10–13</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 14:24'>2Ki 14:24</a> ). Historical and Theological Themes Amos addresses Israel’s two primary sins: 1) an absence of true worship, and 2) a lack of justice. In the midst of their ritualistic performance of worship, they were not pursuing the Lord with their hearts ( <a ref='Amos 4:4–5'>4:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Amos 5:4–6'>5:4–6</a> ) nor following His standard of justice with their neighbors ( <a ref='Amos 5:10–13'>5:10–13</a> ; <a ref='Amos 6:12'>6:12</a> ). This apostasy, evidenced by continual, willful rejection of the prophetic message of Amos, is promised divine judgment. Because of His covenant, however, the Lord will not abandon Israel altogether, but will bring future restoration to the righteous remnant ( <a ref='Amos 9:7–15'>9:7–15</a> ). Interpretive Challenges In <a ref='Amos 9:11'>9:11</a> , the Lord promised that He “will raise up the fallen booth of David.” At the Jerusalem Council, convened to discuss whether Gentiles should be allowed into the church without requiring circumcision, James quotes this passage ( <a ref='Acts 15:15–16'>Ac 15:15–16</a> ) to support Peter’s report of how God had taken “from among the Gentiles a people for His name” ( <a ref='Acts 15:14'>Ac 15:14</a> ). Some have thus concluded that the passage was fulfilled in Jesus, the greater Son of David, through whom the dynasty of David was reestablished. The Acts reference, however, is best seen as an illustration of Amos’ words and not the fulfillment. The temporal allusions to a future time (“In that day,” <a ref='Amos 9:11'>9:11</a> ), when Israel will “possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations” ( <a ref='Amos 9:12'>9:12</a> ), when the Lord will “plant them on their land, and they will not again be uprooted from their land which I have given them” ( <a ref='Amos 9:15'>9:15</a> ), all make it clear that the prophet is speaking of Messiah’s return at the Second Advent to sit upon the throne of David (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 9:7'>Is 9:7</a> ), not the establishment of the church by the apostles.

An earthquake of severe magnitude occurred ca. 755 BC. <a ref='Amos 1:2'>1:2</a> <b>roars.</b> In <a ref='Joel 3:16'>Joel 3:16</a> , Yahweh “roars” against the nations; here His wrath was directed primarily toward Israel (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 25:30'>Jer 25:30</a> ). Amos, a shepherd, courageously warned the flock of God’s pasture that they were in imminent danger from a roaring lion who turned out to be the ultimate Shepherd of the flock (cf. <a ref='Amos 3:8'>3:8</a> ). <b>Carmel.</b> Known for its bountiful trees and lush gardens, “Carmel” means “fertility” or “garden land” and refers to the mountain range that runs east to west in northern Israel and juts out into the Mediterranean Sea (cf. <a ref='Amos 9:3'>9:3</a> ). <a ref='Amos 1:3–2:3'>1:3—2:3</a> Amos began with Israel’s enemies, and thereby gained an initial hearing. When he turned to God’s judgment on Israel, the leaders tried to silence him (cf. <a ref='Amos 7:10–17'>7:10–17</a> ). <a ref='Amos 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>For three transgressions … for four.</b> This rhetorical device is repeated in each of the 8 messages, differing from a similar pattern used elsewhere. These are specific mathematical enumerations (e.g., <a ref='Proverbs 30:18'>Pr 30:18</a> , <a ref='Proverbs 30:21'>21</a> , <a ref='Proverbs 30:29'>29</a> ), emphasizing that each nation was being visited for an incalculable number of infractions. With 3, the cup of iniquity was full; with 4 it overflowed. This judgment was to fall on Syria, whose capital is Damascus. <b>threshed Gilead.</b> Large threshing sleds which, when dragged over grain, would both thresh the grain and cut the straw. Gilead, located in the northeastern, Golan Heights region of Israel, was vulnerable to Syria’s cruel attacks (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 13:7'>2Ki 13:7</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 18:12'>18:12</a> ). Amos: Places Judged by God Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Amos 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>Ben-hadad.</b> Apparently a throne name, meaning “son of (the god) Hadad.” Ben-hadad II was a son of Syrian king Hazael (841–801 BC). <a ref='Amos 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>valley of Aven.</b> Meaning “valley of wickedness,” it may refer to Baalbek, the center of sun worship, located north of Damascus. <b>Beth-eden.</b> “House of pleasure.” It was located in eastern Syria across the Euphrates. <b>Kir.</b> Apparently the original home of the Syrians. It was a region to which they were later exiled ( <a ref='2 Kings 16:9'>2Ki 16:9</a> ). Its exact location is unknown. <a ref='Amos 1:6'>1:6</a> <b>Gaza.</b> Philistia’s most prominent merchant city, ideally situated between Egypt and Israel, here used to refer to the Philistine nation. <b>took away into exile the whole</b> community <b>of exiles.</b> Cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 13:19'>Jer 13:19</a> . Possibly during the reign of Jehoram ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 21:16–17'>2Chr 21:16–17</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:3'>Joel 3:3</a> ), ca. 853–841 BC. <a ref='Amos 1:7–8'>1:7–8</a> Four of the 5 major cities of Philistia. The fifth, Gath, was not mentioned because it had been destroyed earlier by Uzziah ( <a ref='2 Chronicles 26:6'>2Chr 26:6</a> ). <a ref='Amos 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>covenant of brotherhood.</b> A longstanding brotherly relationship existed between Phoenicia and Israel, beginning with King Hiram’s assistance to David in building his house and Solomon in the building of the temple ( <a ref='2 Samuel 5:11'>2Sa 5:11</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 5:1–12'>1Ki 5:1–12</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 9:11–14'>9:11–14</a> ), and later cemented through the marriage of Jezebel to Ahab ( <a ref='1 Kings 16:31'>1Ki 16:31</a> ). No king of Israel ever made war against Phoenicia, especially the two major cities, Tyre and Sidon. <a ref='Amos 1:10'>1:10</a> <b>Tyre.</b> Alexander the Great conquered this stronghold ca. 330 BC (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 26:1–18'>Eze 26:1–18</a> ). <a ref='Amos 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>pursued … corrupted his compassion.</b> More than mere fighting, Edom pursued his brother, stifling any feelings of compassion. <i>See notes on Obadiah</i> for a more complete description of Edom’s judgment. <a ref='Amos 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>Teman.</b> The grandson of Esau ( <a ref='Genesis 36:11'>Ge 36:11</a> ), after whom this town in northern Edom was named. <b>Bozrah.</b> A fortress city of northern Edom, about 35 mi. north of Petra. <a ref='Amos 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>sons of Ammon.</b> Descendants of Ben-ammi, the son of Lot and his younger daughter ( <a ref='Genesis 19:34–38'>Ge 19:34–38</a> ). <b>ripped open the pregnant women.</b> Such inhumane treatment in wartime was not an uncommon practice (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 8:12'>2Ki 8:12</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 15:16'>15:16</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 13:16'>Hos 13:16</a> ). <a ref='Amos 1:14'>1:14</a> <b>Rabbah.</b> Situated east of the Jordan River, this was the capital city. <a ref='Amos 2:1'>2:1</a> <b>Moab.</b> Descendants of Lot and his elder daughter ( <a ref='Genesis 19:37'>Ge 19:37</a> ). <b>burned the bones.</b> This event, where vengeance didn’t stop at death, is not recorded elsewhere in Scripture. <a ref='Amos 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>Kerioth.</b> An important Moabite city, either as a capital or center of worship. <a ref='Amos 2:3'>2:3</a> <b>judge.</b> Possibly denoting the king, who was often so designated ( <a ref='2 Kings 15:5'>2Ki 15:5</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:12'>Da 9:12</a> ). <a ref='Amos 2:4'>2:4</a> <b>Judah.</b> With the judgments against the nations finished, the prophet proceeded to address Judah, moving ever closer to his ultimate target of Israel. <b>rejected the law of Yahweh.</b> The nations were judged because they had sinned against the law of God, which was written in the heart and conscience (cf. <a ref='Romans 2:14–15'>Ro 2:14–15</a> ). Judah and Israel were judged because they sinned against God’s revealed, written law. <a ref='Amos 2:5'>2:5</a> <b>fire upon Judah.</b> The Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar fulfilled this judgment, ca. 605–586 BC (cf. <a ref='2Ki 24-25'>2Ki 24–25</a> ). <a ref='Amos 2:6–7'>2:6–7</a> Greed, so all-consuming that for insignificant debts they would sell another into slavery (cf. <a ref='Matthew 18:23–35'>Mt 18:23–35</a> ), was accompanied by uncontained sexual passion. Care for the poor is a prominent OT theme (e.g., <a ref='Proverbs 14:31'>Pr 14:31</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 17:5'>17:5</a> ) and sexual purity is mandated repeatedly. Violations of both are an affront to God’s holy name. <a ref='Amos 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>go to the same young woman.</b> In the context of oppressing the helpless, the reference was probably to a slave girl (cf. <a ref='Exodus 21:7–11'>Ex 21:7–11</a> ). <a ref='Amos 2:8'>2:8</a> <b>garments taken as pledges.</b> Outer garments used to secure a loan were to be returned before sunset ( <a ref='Exodus 22:25–27'>Ex 22:25–27</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 24:12–13'>Dt 24:12–13</a> ); instead, they used them to engage in idolatrous acts. <a ref='Amos 2:9'>2:9</a> <b>Amorite.</b> The pre-Conquest inhabitants of Canaan, whom God defeated for the Jews (cf. <a ref='Joshua 10:12–15'>Jos 10:12–15</a> ). Their giant stature was said to make the spies look like grasshoppers ( <a ref='Numbers 13:32–33'>Nu 13:32–33</a> ). <a ref='Amos 2:11'>2:11</a> <b>Nazirites.</b> See <a ref='Numbers 6:1–21'>Nu 6:1–21</a> . <a ref='Amos 2:14–16'>2:14–16</a> Neither personal strength nor military armament was sufficient to prevent Yahweh’s hand of judgment by the Assyrians ca. 722 BC (cf. <a ref='2Ki 17'>2Ki 17</a> ). <a ref='Amos 3:1'>3:1</a> <b>the entire family.</b> The primary recipient of these messages was Israel; Judah was not excluded. <a ref='Amos 3:2'>3:2</a> <b>You only have I known.</b> God’s sovereign choice of Israel did not exempt her from punishment for disobedience. <a ref='Amos 3:3–8'>3:3–8</a> Yahweh posed a series of questions to show that, as some things are certain in nature, surely nothing happens in Israel that is outside His sovereignty. Certain actions have certain results! Yahweh had spoken a word, and therefore the prophet was to speak, and the people were to listen with trembling. Instead, they tried to silence the prophet (cf. <a ref='Amos 2:12'>2:12</a> ; <a ref='Amos 7:12–13'>7:12–13</a> ). <a ref='Amos 3:7'>3:7</a> Judgment is coming, but Yahweh graciously warned the nation in advance through His prophets (e.g., Noah, <a ref='Ge 6'>Ge 6</a> ; Abraham, <a ref='Ge 18'>Ge 18</a> ). <a ref='Amos 3:9'>3:9</a> The heathen nations, such as the Philistines and Egyptians, were rhetorically summoned to witness God’s judgment. If they condemn Israel, how much more will a righteous God? <a ref='Amos 3:11'>3:11</a> <b>An adversary.</b> The Assyrians who captured and deported Israel in 722 BC. <a ref='Amos 3:12'>3:12</a> Yahweh gives a vivid description of the small remnant left in Israel after the Assyrian invasion. <a ref='Amos 3:13'>3:13</a> <b>Hear and testify.</b> As in v. <a ref='Amos 3:9'>9</a> , the heathen nations were once again called upon to witness and testify. <a ref='Amos 3:14'>3:14</a> <b>Bethel.</b> The principal place of idol worship in Israel (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 12:25–33'>1Ki 12:25–33</a> ). <a ref='Amos 4:1'>4:1</a> <b>cows of Bashan.</b> A description of the women of Samaria who lived luxurious lives (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 3:16–26'>Is 3:16–26</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 32:9–13'>32:9–13</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 4:30'>Jer 4:30</a> ). Bashan was a fertile region below Mt. Hermon east of the Jordan River known for its lush pastures. Under Jeroboam II, Israel was enjoying great prosperity. <a ref='Amos 4:3'>4:3</a> through <b>breaches</b> in the walls <b>… to Harmon.</b> Captives will be led out of the city through breaches in the walls, depicting massive overthrow. The location of Harmon is unknown. <a ref='Amos 4:4–5'>4:4–5</a> With poignant sarcasm, Amos indicted Israel for idolatrous sacrifices and ritualistic religion. <a ref='Amos 4:4'>4:4</a> <b>Bethel … Gilgal.</b> Bethel, the place of Jacob’s dream ( <a ref='Ge 28'>Ge 28</a> ), and Gilgal, where Israel was circumcised before surrounding Jericho ( <a ref='Joshua 5:1–9'>Jos 5:1–9</a> ), were sacred to Israel. <a ref='Amos 4:5'>4:5</a> <b>offering … leavened.</b> Though prohibited from most offerings, leaven was required as a part of the thank offering ( <a ref='Leviticus 7:11–15'>Lv 7:11–15</a> ). <a ref='Amos 4:6–11'>4:6–11</a> Past warnings were futile, a fact repeatedly emphasized by “Yet you have not returned to Me” (vv. <a ref='Amos 4:6'>6</a> , <a ref='Amos 4:8–11'>8–11</a> ). <a ref='Amos 4:6'>4:6</a> <b>cleanness of teeth.</b> Amos employed this euphemism to depict the absence of food during famine and drought sent by God to warn Israel, which he described in vv. <a ref='Amos 4:6–9'>6–9</a> (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:22–24'>Dt 28:22–24</a> , <a ref='Deuteronomy 28:47–48'>47–48</a> ; <a ref='Leviticus 26:18'>Lv 26:18</a> ). <a ref='Amos 4:11'>4:11</a> <b>firebrand delivered from a blaze.</b> Only because of God’s mercy was Israel saved from extinction (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 3:2'>Zec 3:2</a> ; <a ref='Jude 1:23'>Jd 23</a> ). <a ref='Amos 4:12'>4:12</a> <b>Prepare to meet your God.</b> The general concept was first used of Israel’s preparation to receive the covenant at Sinai ( <a ref='Exodus 19:11'>Ex 19:11</a> , <a ref='Exodus 19:15'>15</a> ); here she was implored to prepare for His judgment. <a ref='Amos 4:13'>4:13</a> This is the God whom they were to be prepared to face. He is the Lord God Almighty. <a ref='Amos 5:1–2'>5:1–2</a> A funeral dirge was taken up for Israel, likened to a young woman who had died. <a ref='Amos 5:3'>5:3</a> Many were to be killed in battle or taken captive; only a handful would return (cf. <a ref='Amos 3:12'>3:12</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 6:11–13'>Is 6:11–13</a> ). <a ref='Amos 5:5'>5:5</a> <b>Bethel … Gilgal.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Amos 4:4'>4:4</a> .</i> <b>Beersheba.</b> Located in southern Judah, 50 mi. southwest of Jerusalem, Beersheba had a rich Israelite history (cf. <a ref='Genesis 21:33'>Ge 21:33</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 26:23'>26:23</a> ; <a ref='1 Samuel 8:1–3'>1Sa 8:1–3</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 19:3–7'>1Ki 19:3–7</a> ).

Israel was guilty of worshiping the stars (cf. v. <a ref='Amos 5:26'>26</a> ) instead of their Creator. <a ref='Amos 5:10–13'>5:10–13</a> The fabric of justice had been destroyed, causing pervasive corruption “in the gate,” the place where justice was administered (cf. v. <a ref='Amos 5:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 21:19'>Dt 21:19</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 20:4'>Jos 20:4</a> ). The Preservation of a Remnant In the eighth century BC, Amos prophesied Israel’s doom ( <a ref='Amos 8:1–2'>8:1–2</a> ), but he also declared the possibility of deliverance for the “remnant of Joseph” ( <a ref='Amos 5:15'>5:15</a> ). Throughout history God has always preserved a remnant of His people.

Warned against Molech worship ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:9–13'>Dt 18:9–13</a> ), Israel nevertheless pursued all facets of it, continuing with Solomon ( <a ref='1 Kings 11:7'>1Ki 11:7</a> ) and his descendants ( <a ref='1 Kings 12:28'>1Ki 12:28</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 17:16–17'>2Ki 17:16–17</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 32:35'>Jer 32:35</a> ) until Josiah ( <a ref='2 Kings 23:10'>2Ki 23:10</a> ). Stephen recited <a ref='Amos 5:25–27'>Am 5:25–27</a> when he recounted the sins of Israel in <a ref='Acts 7:42–43'>Ac 7:42–43</a> . <a ref='Amos 5:27'>5:27</a> Assyria conquered Damascus in 732 BC, then overtook Israel in 722 BC. <a ref='Amos 6:1–2'>6:1–2</a> The two capitals of Judah and Israel, Zion and Samaria, were invited to look around. If Calneh (possibly the Calno of <a ref='Isaiah 10:9'>Is 10:9</a> ) and Hamath (Syria) and Gath (Philistia) could not put off judgment, how could they? <a ref='Amos 6:6'>6:6</a> <b>drink wine from</b> sacrificial <b>bowls.</b> These large bowls, usually used for sacrificial purposes, here typify the excesses of their lifestyle. <a ref='Amos 6:8'>6:8</a> <b>sworn by Himself.</b> Cf. <a ref='Genesis 22:16'>Ge 22:16</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 6:13–14'>Heb 6:13–14</a> . <a ref='Amos 6:9–10'>6:9–10</a> The judgment was so comprehensive that even small remnants were sought out and killed. <a ref='Amos 6:10'>6:10</a> <b>the one who burns … bones.</b> This could refer to cremation, demanded by the excessive number killed and because of fear of epidemics. With rare exceptions (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 31:12'>1Sa 31:12</a> ), corpses were buried in ancient Israel. <b>name of Yahweh is not to be mentioned.</b> Previously welcomed as a friend, Yahweh came in judgment as a foe; survivors would not want to invoke His name out of fear. <a ref='Amos 6:12'>6:12</a> Israel’s exercise of justice was as absurd as running horses on rocks or plowing rocks with oxen. <a ref='Amos 6:13'>6:13</a> <b>Lo-debar … Karnaim.</b> These were, apparently, two Syrian sites captured by Jeroboam II (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 14:25'>2Ki 14:25</a> ). “Lo-debar” means “nothing” and sarcastically points out that Israel’s “great” gain will amount to nothing. “Karnaim” means “horns,” which symbolizes the strength of an animal. Israel foolishly believed they had conquered in their own strength. <a ref='Amos 6:14'>6:14</a> <b>a nation.</b> Assyria in 722 BC. <b>Lebo-hamath … brook of the Arabah.</b> These represent the northern and southern perimeters of the kingdom as reestablished by Jeroboam II (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 14:25'>2Ki 14:25</a> ). <a ref='Amos 7:1–9:10'>7:1—9:10</a> Amos introduced 5 visions, with a historical interlude ( <a ref='Amos 7:10–17'>7:10–17</a> ). The first two depict Yahweh’s commitment to spare a remnant, while the last 3 announce the inevitability of judgment. <a ref='Amos 7:1–3'>7:1–3</a> The first vision, symbolizing God’s action, saw a swarm of locusts devouring the people’s portion of the later cuttings, after the king had taken the first cutting (cf. <a ref='Joel 1:2–12'>Joel 1:2–12</a> ). Five Visions of Amos 1. Vision of Locusts ( <a ref='Amos 7:1–3'>7:1–3</a> ) 2. Vision of Fire ( <a ref='Amos 7:4–6'>7:4–6</a> ) 3. Vision of the Plumb Line ( <a ref='Amos 7:7–9'>7:7–9</a> ) 4. Vision of the Summer Fruit ( <a ref='Amos 8:1–14'>8:1–14</a> ) 5. Vision of the Lord ( <a ref='Amos 9:1–10'>9:1–10</a> ) Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Amos 7:3'>7:3</a> <b>Yahweh relented.</b> Much like He did at Abraham’s pleading over Sodom in <a ref='Genesis 18:22–23'>Ge 18:22–23</a> . <a ref='Amos 7:4–6'>7:4–6</a> Under the figure of fire, the second vision concerns a devastating drought, causing the underground water supplies to dry up and the fields to be consumed (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:22'>Dt 32:22</a> ). Amos again pleaded Israel’s cause (cf. vv. <a ref='Amos 7:2–3'>2–3</a> ). <a ref='Amos 7:7–9'>7:7–9</a> The true spiritual nature of Israel was here tested (and found wanting) by God’s plumb line of righteousness in this third of 5 visions. The sword of judgment was to come from Assyria. <a ref='Amos 7:10–17'>7:10–17</a> The words of Amos cut deep into the heart of Israel’s leadership, causing them to accuse him of conspiracy against the king (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 26:11'>Jer 26:11</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 37:11–13'>37:11–13</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 38:1–6'>38:1–6</a> ). <a ref='Amos 7:11'>7:11</a> <b>Amos says.</b> This most likely refers to v. <a ref='Amos 7:9'>9</a> . <a ref='Amos 7:17'>7:17</a> <b>go … into exile.</b> To Assyria ca. 722 BC. <a ref='Amos 8:1'>8:1</a> <b>summer fruit.</b> In this fourth vision, as fruit was fully ripened by the summer’s sun, so Israel was ripe for judgment. <a ref='Amos 8:5'>8:5</a> <b>new moon.</b> Based on a lunar calendar, Israel would celebrate the day with a festival. Like the Sabbath, no work was to be done ( <a ref='1 Samuel 20:5–6'>1Sa 20:5–6</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 4:23'>2Ki 4:23</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 46:3'>Eze 46:3</a> ). The merchants’ eagerness for the day to end revealed their appetite for greed. <b>bushel smaller … shekel bigger.</b> By dishonest weighing, the merchant decreased the actual amount received and increased the cost of the merchandise. <i>See note on <a ref='Proverbs 11:1'>Pr 11:1</a></i> for other passages on dishonest measures. <a ref='Amos 8:6'>8:6</a> <b>refuse of the wheat.</b> This denotes the chaff, which was mixed into the good wheat to cheat the buyer. <a ref='Amos 8:7'>8:7</a> <b>pride of Jacob.</b> As surely as the nation was filled with pride, so Yahweh would not forget her works (cf. <a ref='Amos 6:8'>6:8</a> ). <a ref='Amos 8:8'>8:8</a> <b>tossed about and subside like the Nile of Egypt.</b> Like the Nile, which annually provided water and rich soil deposits for farmers by greatly overflowing its banks, so judgment would overflow the land. <a ref='Amos 8:9'>8:9</a> <b>the sun go down at noon.</b> Probably referring to the total eclipse of the sun ca. 763 BC as a picture of God’s coming judgment. <a ref='Amos 8:10'>8:10</a> <b>sackcloth.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Joel 1:8'>Joel 1:8</a> .</i> <a ref='Amos 8:11–12'>8:11–12</a> During prosperity, the nation rejected the prophets (cf. <a ref='Amos 7:10–17'>7:10–17</a> ); in captivity no word from Yahweh could be found (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 28:6'>1Sa 28:6ff.</a> ). <a ref='Amos 8:14'>8:14</a> <b>Samaria … Dan.</b> Jeroboam I built altars at both locations in an effort to keep Israel from going to Jerusalem to worship ( <a ref='1 Kings 12:26–29'>1Ki 12:26–29</a> ). <b>Beersheba.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Amos 5:5'>5:5</a> .</i> <a ref='Amos 9:1'>9:1</a> The fifth vision opens with Yahweh standing beside the altar in Bethel, commanding that the temple be torn down, thus falling upon the worshipers. He would spare none. <a ref='Amos 9:2–4'>9:2–4</a> Desperate to escape, none will successfully hide from the hand of judgment. Righteous David found solace in the omnipresence of God ( <a ref='Psalms 139:7–10'>Ps 139:7–10</a> ; cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 23:23–24'>Jer 23:23–24</a> ); the wicked find only His wrath (cf. <a ref='Revelation 20:13'>Rev 20:13</a> ). <a ref='Amos 9:3'>9:3</a> <b>Carmel.</b> A mountainous region, rising 1800 feet above the Mediterranean, known for its many caves and forests. <i>See note on <a ref='Amos 1:2'>1:2</a> .</i> <a ref='Amos 9:5–9'>9:5–9</a> Lest anyone question Yahweh’s power, they are reminded of His omnipotence revealed in creation and in His sovereign rulership of the nations.
