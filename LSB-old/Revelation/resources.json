    "content": "The Revelation to John Title Unlike most books of the Bible, Revelation contains its own title: “The Revelation of Jesus Christ” ( <a ref='Revelation 1:1'>1:1</a> ). “Revelation” (Greek, <i>apokalupsis</i> ) means “an uncovering,” “an unveiling,” or “a disclosure.” In the NT, this word describes the unveiling of spiritual truth ( <a ref='Romans 16:25'>Ro 16:25</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 1:12'>Ga 1:12</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:17'>Eph 1:17</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 3:3'>3:3</a> ), the revealing of the sons of God ( <a ref='Romans 8:19'>Ro 8:19</a> ), Christ’s incarnation ( <a ref='Luke 2:32'>Lk 2:32</a> ), and His glorious appearing at His second coming ( <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:7'>2Th 1:7</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:7'>1Pe 1:7</a> ). In all its uses, “revelation” refers to something or someone, once hidden, becoming visible. What this book reveals or unveils is Jesus Christ in glory. Truths about Him and His final victory, that the rest of Scripture merely allude to, become clearly visible through revelation about Jesus Christ (see Historical and Theological Themes). This revelation was given to Him by God the Father, and it was communicated to the apostle John by an angel ( <a ref='Revelation 1:1'>1:1</a> ). Author and Date Four times the author identifies himself as John ( <a ref='Revelation 1:1'>1:1</a> , <a ref='Revelation 1:4'>4</a> , <a ref='Revelation 1:9'>9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 22:8'>22:8</a> ). Early tradition unanimously identified him as John the apostle, author of the fourth Gospel and three epistles. For example, important second century witnesses to the apostle John’s authorship include Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian. Many of the book’s original readers were still alive during the lifetimes of Justin Martyr and Irenaeus—both of whom held to apostolic authorship. There are differences in style between Revelation and John’s other writings, but they are insignificant and do not preclude one man from writing both. In fact, there are some striking parallels between Revelation and John’s other works. Only John’s Gospel and Revelation refer to Jesus Christ as the Word ( <a ref='Revelation 19:13'>19:13</a> ; <a ref='John 1:1'>Jn 1:1</a> ). Revelation ( <a ref='Revelation 1:7'>1:7</a> ) and John’s Gospel ( <a ref='John 19:37'>19:37</a> ) translate <a ref='Zechariah 12:10'>Zec 12:10</a> differently from the Septuagint, but in agreement with each other. Only Revelation and the Gospel of John describe Jesus as the Lamb ( <a ref='Revelation 5:6'>5:6</a> , <a ref='Revelation 5:8'>8</a> ; <a ref='John 1:29'>Jn 1:29</a> ); both describe Jesus as a witness (cf. <a ref='Revelation 1:5'>1:5</a> ; <a ref='John 5:31–32'>Jn 5:31–32</a> ). Revelation was written in the last decade of the first century (ca. AD 94–96), near the end of Emperor Domitian’s reign (AD 81–96). Although some date it during Nero’s reign (AD 54–68), their arguments are unconvincing and conflict with the view of the early church. Writing in the second century, Irenaeus declared that Revelation had been written toward the end of Domitian’s reign. Later writers, such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Victorinus (who wrote one of the earliest commentaries on Revelation), Eusebius, and Jerome affirm the Domitian date. The spiritual decline of the 7 churches (chaps. <a ref='Rev 2-3'>2–3</a> ) also argues for the later date. Those churches were strong and spiritually healthy in the mid-60s, when Paul last ministered in Asia Minor. The brief time between Paul’s ministry there and the end of Nero’s reign was too short for such a decline to have occurred. The longer time gap also explains the rise of the heretical sect known as the Nicolaitans ( <a ref='Revelation 2:6'>2:6</a> , <a ref='Revelation 2:15'>15</a> ), who are not mentioned in Paul’s letters, not even to one or more of these same churches (Ephesians). Finally, dating Revelation during Nero’s reign does not allow time for John’s ministry in Asia Minor to reach the point at which the authorities would have felt the need to exile him. Background and Setting Revelation begins with John, the last surviving apostle and an old man, in exile on the small, barren island of Patmos, located in the Aegean Sea southwest of Ephesus. The Roman authorities had banished him there because of his faithful preaching of the gospel ( <a ref='Revelation 1:9'>1:9</a> ). While on Patmos, John received a series of visions that laid out the future history of the world. When he was arrested, John was in Ephesus, ministering to the church there and in the surrounding cities. Seeking to strengthen those congregations, he could no longer minister to them in person and, following the divine command ( <a ref='Revelation 1:11'>1:11</a> ), John addressed Revelation to them ( <a ref='Revelation 1:4'>1:4</a> ). The churches had begun to feel the effects of persecution; at least one man—probably a pastor—had already been martyred ( <a ref='Revelation 2:13'>2:13</a> ), and John himself had been exiled. But the storm of persecution was about to break in full fury upon the 7 churches so dear to the apostle’s heart ( <a ref='Revelation 2:10'>2:10</a> ). To those churches, Revelation provided a message of hope: God is in sovereign control of all the events of human history, and though evil often seems pervasive and wicked men all powerful, their ultimate doom is certain. Christ will come in glory to judge and rule. Historical and Theological Themes Since it is primarily prophetic, Revelation contains little historical material, other than that in chaps. <a ref='Rev 1-3'>1–3</a> . The 7 churches to whom the letters were addressed were existing churches in Asia Minor (modern Turkey). Apparently, they were singled out because John had ministered in them. Revelation is first and foremost a revelation about Jesus Christ ( <a ref='Revelation 1:1'>1:1</a> ). The book depicts Him as the risen, glorified Son of God ministering among the churches ( <a ref='Revelation 1:10'>1:10ff.</a> ); as “the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth” ( <a ref='Revelation 1:5'>1:5</a> ); as “the Alpha and the Omega” ( <a ref='Revelation 1:8'>1:8</a> ); as the one “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty” ( <a ref='Revelation 1:8'>1:8</a> ); as a son of man ( <a ref='Revelation 1:13'>1:13</a> ); as the one who was dead, but now is alive forevermore ( <a ref='Revelation 1:18'>1:18</a> ); as the Son of God ( <a ref='Revelation 2:18'>2:18</a> ); as the one who is holy and true ( <a ref='Revelation 3:7'>3:7</a> ); as “the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God” ( <a ref='Revelation 3:14'>3:14</a> ); as the Lion of the tribe of Judah ( <a ref='Revelation 5:5'>5:5</a> ); as the Lamb in heaven, with authority to open the title deed to the earth ( <a ref='Revelation 6:1'>6:1ff.</a> ); as the Lamb on the throne ( <a ref='Revelation 7:17'>7:17</a> ); as the Messiah who will reign forever ( <a ref='Revelation 11:15'>11:15</a> ); as the Word of God ( <a ref='Revelation 19:13'>19:13</a> ); as the majestic King of kings and Lord of lords, returning in glorious splendor to conquer His foes ( <a ref='Revelation 19:11'>19:11ff.</a> ); and as “the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star” ( <a ref='Revelation 22:16'>22:16</a> ). Many other rich theological themes find expression in Revelation. The church is warned about sin and exhorted to holiness. John’s vivid pictures of worship in heaven both exhort and instruct believers. In few other books of the Bible is the ministry of angels so prominent. Revelation’s primary theological contribution is to eschatology, i.e., the doctrine of last things. In it we learn about: the final political setup of the world; the last battle of human history; the career and ultimate defeat of Antichrist; Christ’s 1,000-year earthly kingdom; the glories of heaven and the eternal state; and the final state of the wicked and the righteous. Finally, only Daniel rivals this book in declaring that God providentially rules over the kingdoms of men and will accomplish His sovereign purposes regardless of human or demonic opposition. Interpretive Challenges No other NT book poses more serious and difficult interpretive challenges than Revelation. The book’s vivid imagery and striking symbolism have produced 4 main interpretive approaches: The <i>preterist</i> approach interprets Revelation as a description of first-century events in the Roman Empire (see Author and Date). This view conflicts with the book’s own often repeated claim to be prophecy ( <a ref='Revelation 1:3'>1:3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 22:7'>22:7</a> , <a ref='Revelation 22:10'>10</a> , <a ref='Revelation 22:18–19'>18–19</a> ). It is impossible to see all the events in Revelation as already fulfilled. The second coming of Christ, for example, obviously did not take place in the first century. The <i>historicist</i> approach views Revelation as a panoramic view of church history from apostolic times to the present—seeing in the symbolism such events as the barbarian invasions of Rome, the rise of the Roman Catholic Church (as well as various individual popes), the emergence of Islam, and the French Revolution. This interpretive method robs Revelation of any meaning for those to whom it was written. It also ignores the time limitations the book itself places on the unfolding events (cf. <a ref='Revelation 11:2'>11:2</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:6'>12:6</a> , <a ref='Revelation 12:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:5'>13:5</a> ). Historicism has produced many different—and often conflicting—interpretations of the actual historical events contained in Revelation. The <i>idealist</i> approach interprets Revelation as a timeless depiction of the cosmic struggle between the forces of good and evil. In this view, the book contains neither historical allusions nor predictive prophecy. This view also ignores Revelation’s prophetic character and, if carried to its logical conclusion, severs the book from any connection with actual historical events. Revelation then becomes merely a collection of stories designed to teach spiritual truth. The <i>futurist</i> approach insists that the events of chaps. <a ref='Rev 6-22'>6–22</a> are yet future, and that those chapters literally and symbolically depict actual people and events yet to appear on the world scene. It describes the events surrounding the second coming of Jesus Christ (chaps. <a ref='Rev 6-19'>6–19</a> ), the Millennium and final judgment (chap. <a ref='Rev 20'>20</a> ), and the eternal state (chaps. <a ref='Rev 21-22'>21–22</a> ). Only this view does justice to Revelation’s claim to be prophecy and interprets the book by the same grammatical-historical method as chaps. <a ref='Rev 1-3'>1–3</a> and the rest of Scripture.

    "content": "Study Notes and Features <a ref='Revelation 1:1'>1:1</a> <b>The Revelation.</b> The Greek word from which the English word “apocalypse” comes lit. means “to uncover, or to reveal.” When it refers to a person, it means that person becomes clearly visible (see Introduction: Title ; cf. <a ref='Luke 2:30–32'>Lk 2:30–32</a> ; <a ref='Romans 8:19'>Ro 8:19</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:7'>1Co 1:7</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:7'>1Pe 1:7</a> ). <b>Jesus Christ.</b> The Gospels unveil Christ at His first coming in humiliation; Revelation reveals Him in His exaltation: 1) in blazing glory (vv. <a ref='Revelation 1:7–20'>7–20</a> ); 2) over His church, as its Lord (chaps. <a ref='Rev 2-3'>2–3</a> ); 3) in His second coming, as He takes back the earth from the usurper, Satan, and establishes His kingdom (chaps. <a ref='Rev 4-20'>4–20</a> ); and 4) as He lights up the eternal state (chaps. <a ref='Rev 21-22'>21–22</a> ). The NT writers eagerly anticipate this unveiling ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 1:7'>1Co 1:7</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:7'>2Th 1:7</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:7'>1Pe 1:7</a> ). <b>God gave Him.</b> As a reward for Christ’s perfect submission and atonement, the Father now presented to Him the great record of His future glory (cf. <a ref='Philippians 2:5–11'>Php 2:5–11</a> ). Readers eavesdrop on the gift of this book, from the Father to His Son. <b>soon.</b> This word (cf. <a ref='Revelation 2:5'>2:5</a> , <a ref='Revelation 2:16'>16</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 3:11'>3:11</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:14'>11:14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 22:12'>22:12</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 4:9'>2Ti 4:9</a> ) underscores the imminence of Christ’s return. <a ref='Revelation 1:3'>1:3</a> <b>Blessed.</b> This is the only biblical book that comes with a blessing for the one who listens to it being read and explained and then responds in obedience. This is the first of 7 beatitudes in the book (v. <a ref='Revelation 1:3'>3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:13'>14:13</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:15'>16:15</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:9'>19:9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:6'>20:6</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 22:7'>22:7</a> , <a ref='Revelation 22:14'>14</a> ). <b>time is near.</b> “Time” refers to epochs, eras, or seasons. The next great epoch of God’s redemptive history is imminent. But although Christ’s coming is the next event, it may be delayed so long that people begin to question whether He will ever come (cf. <a ref='Matthew 24:36–39'>Mt 24:36–39</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 3:3–4'>2Pe 3:3–4</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 1:4'>1:4</a> <b>seven churches that are in Asia.</b> Asia Minor, equivalent to modern Turkey, was composed of 7 postal districts. At the center of those districts were 7 key cities which served as central points for the dissemination of information. It is to the churches in those cities that John writes. <b>who is and who was and who is to come.</b> God’s eternal presence is not limited by time. He has always been present and will come in the future. <b>the seven Spirits.</b> There are two possible meanings: 1) a reference to Isaiah’s prophecy concerning the 7-fold ministry of the Holy Spirit ( <a ref='Isaiah 11:2'>Is 11:2</a> ); or 2) more likely, it is a reference to the lampstand with 7 lamps (a menorah) in Zechariah—also a description of the Holy Spirit ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Revelation 4:5'>4:5</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 5:6'>5:6</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 4:1–10'>Zec 4:1–10</a></i> ). In either case, 7 is the number of completeness, so John is identifying the fullness of the Holy Spirit. <a ref='Revelation 1:5'>1:5</a> <b>firstborn.</b> Of all who have been or will be raised from the dead, He is the preeminent one, the only one who is the rightful heir (cf. <a ref='Revelation 3:14'>3:14</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 89:27'>Ps 89:27</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:15'>Col 1:15</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 1:6'>1:6</a> <b>a kingdom, priests.</b> All who believe live in the sphere of God’s rule, a kingdom entered by faith in Jesus Christ. And as priests, believers have the right to enter God’s presence. <a ref='Revelation 1:7'>1:7</a> coming with the clouds <b>.</b> This echoes the promise of Daniel: The Son of Man will come with the clouds of heaven ( <a ref='Daniel 7:13'>Da 7:13</a> )—not ordinary clouds but clouds of glory. In the OT, God often manifested Himself in an energized, blazing light, called the Shekinah or glory cloud. No one could see it fully and live ( <a ref='Exodus 33:20'>Ex 33:20</a> ), so it had to be veiled. But when Christ returns, the glory will be completely visible. Cf. <a ref='Matthew 24:29–30'>Mt 24:29–30</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 25:31'>25:31</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Revelation 6:12–17'>6:12–17</a></i> . those who pierced <b>.</b> Not a reference to the 4 Roman soldiers usually involved in crucifixion, but to the Jews who were actually responsible for Christ’s death ( <a ref='Acts 2:22–23'>Ac 2:22–23</a> ; <a ref='Acts 3:14–15'>3:14–15</a> ). Zechariah identified the ones who pierced Him as “the house of David” and “the inhabitants of Jerusalem,” and prophesied that they will weep tears of genuine repentance because of what they did to their Messiah ( <a ref='Zechariah 12:10'>Zec 12:10</a> ). <b>all the tribes … will</b> mourn <b>.</b> The mourning of the rest of the earth’s inhabitants is not that which accompanies genuine repentance (cf. <a ref='Revelation 9:21'>9:21</a> ). It is the result of guilt for sin and fear of punishment ( <a ref='Revelation 6:16'>6:16</a> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 3:8–10'>Ge 3:8–10</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 1:8'>1:8</a> <b>the Alpha and the Omega.</b> These are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. An alphabet is an ingenious way to store and communicate knowledge. The 26 letters in the English alphabet, arranged in almost endless combinations, can hold and convey all knowledge. Christ is the supreme, sovereign alphabet; there is nothing outside His knowledge, so as there are no unknown factors that can sabotage His second coming. (cf. <a ref='Colossians 2:3'>Col 2:3</a> ). <b>the Almighty.</b> “Almighty God” or “the Almighty” occurs 8 times in Revelation, underscoring that God’s power is supreme over all the cataclysmic events it records (see also <a ref='Revelation 4:8'>4:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:17'>11:17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 15:3'>15:3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:7'>16:7</a> , <a ref='Revelation 16:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:15'>19:15</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 21:22'>21:22</a> ). He exercises sovereign control over every person, object, and event, and not one molecule in the universe is outside that dominion. <a ref='Revelation 1:9–18'>1:9–18</a> This vision of Christ is equaled in grandeur only by the vision of His final return as King of kings and Lord of lords ( <a ref='Revelation 19:11–16'>19:11–16</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 1:9'>1:9</a> <b>tribulation and kingdom and perseverance.</b> Four characteristics that John and his believing readers share: 1) persecution for their faith; 2) membership in the redeemed community over which Christ serves as Lord and King; 3) eager anticipation of the glory of His coming millennial reign on earth; and 4) endurance and perseverance in spite of difficult times. <b>island called Patmos.</b> Located in the Aegean Sea off the coast of Asia Minor (modern Turkey) and part of a group of about 50 islands, Patmos was a barren, rocky, crescent-shaped island in John’s day that was about 10 mi. long and less than 6 mi. at its widest point. It served as a Roman penal colony. According to early Christian historian, Eusebius, the emperor Nerva (AD 96–98) released John from Patmos. <a ref='Revelation 1:10'>1:10</a> <b>in the Spirit.</b> This was not a dream. John was supernaturally transported out of the material world awake—not sleeping—to an experience beyond the normal senses. The Holy Spirit empowered his senses to perceive revelation from God (cf. <a ref='Acts 10:11'>Ac 10:11</a> ). <b>Lord’s day.</b> This phrase appears in many early Christian writings and refers to Sunday, the day of the Lord’s resurrection. Some have suggested this phrase refers to “the Day of the Lord,” but the context doesn’t support that interpretation. <b>loud voice.</b> Throughout Revelation, a loud sound or voice indicates the solemnity of what God is about to reveal. <a ref='Revelation 1:11'>1:11</a> <b>scroll.</b> The Greek word refers to a scroll made of parchment formed from papyrus, a reed that grows plentifully along the Nile. The Seven Churches of the Apocalypse Go to the Index of Charts and Maps . <a ref='Revelation 1:12'>1:12</a> <b>lampstands.</b> These were portable gold lampstands that held small oil lamps. Each lampstand represented a church (v. <a ref='Revelation 1:20'>20</a> ), from which the light of life shone. Throughout Scripture, 7 is the number of completeness, so these 7 lampstands are representative of all the churches. <a ref='Revelation 1:13'>1:13</a> <b>son of man.</b> According to the Gospels, this is the title Christ used most often for Himself during His earthly ministry (81 times in the Gospels). Taken from the heavenly vision in <a ref='Daniel 7:13'>Da 7:13</a> , it is an implied claim to deity. <b>robe.</b> Most occurrences of this word in the Septuagint, the Greek OT, refer to the garment of the High Priest. The golden sash across His chest completes the picture of Christ serving in His priestly role (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 16:1–4'>Lv 16:1–4</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 2:17'>Heb 2:17</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 1:14'>1:14</a> <b>like white wool.</b> “White” does not refer to a flat white color but a blazing, glowing, white light (cf. <a ref='Daniel 7:9'>Da 7:9</a> ). Like the glory cloud (or Shekinah), it is a picture of His holiness. <b>eyes … flame of fire.</b> Like two lasers, the eyes of the exalted Lord look with penetrating gaze into the depths of His church ( <a ref='Revelation 2:18'>2:18</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:12'>19:12</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 4:13'>Heb 4:13</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 1:15'>1:15</a> <b>feet … burnished bronze.</b> The altar of burnt offering was covered with brass and its utensils were made of the same material (cf. <a ref='Exodus 38:1–7'>Ex 38:1–7</a> ). Glowing hot, brass feet are a clear reference to divine judgment. Jesus Christ with feet of judgment is moving through His church to exercise His chastening authority upon sin. <b>voice … sound of many waters.</b> No longer was His voice like the crystal clear note of a trumpet (v. <a ref='Revelation 1:10'>10</a> ), but John likened it to the crashing of the surf against the rocks of the island (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 43:2'>Eze 43:2</a> ). It was the voice of authority. <a ref='Revelation 1:16'>1:16</a> <b>seven stars.</b> These are the messengers who represent the 7 churches ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Revelation 1:20'>20</a></i> ). Christ holds them in His hand, which means that He controls the church and its leaders. <b>a sharp two-edged sword.</b> A large, two-edged broad sword. It signifies judgment (cf. <a ref='Revelation 2:16'>2:16</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:15'>19:15</a> ) on those who attack His people and destroy His church. <a ref='Revelation 1:17'>1:17</a> <b>fell at His feet.</b> A common response to seeing the awesome glory of the Lord ( <a ref='Genesis 17:3'>Ge 17:3</a> ; <a ref='Numbers 16:22'>Nu 16:22</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 6:1–8'>Is 6:1–8</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 1:28'>Eze 1:28</a> ; <a ref='Acts 9:4'>Ac 9:4</a> ). <b>first and the last.</b> Jesus Christ applies this OT name for Yahweh ( <a ref='Revelation 22:13'>22:13</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 41:4'>Is 41:4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 44:6'>44:6</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 48:12'>48:12</a> ) to Himself, clearly claiming to be God. Idols will come and go.

Christ decides who lives, who dies, and when. <a ref='Revelation 1:19'>1:19</a> This verse provides a simple outline for the entire book: “the things which you have seen” refers to the vision John has just seen (chap. <a ref='Rev 1'>1</a> ); “the things which are” denotes the letters to the churches (chaps. <a ref='Rev 2-3'>2–3</a> ); and “the things which will take place after these things” refers to the revelation of future history (chaps. <a ref='Rev 4-22'>4–22</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 1:20'>1:20</a> <b>the angels.</b> The word lit. means “messenger.” Although it can mean angel—and does throughout the book—it cannot refer to angels here because angels are never leaders in the church. Most likely, these messengers are the 7 key elders representing each of those churches ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Revelation 1:16'>16</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 2:1–3:22'>2:1—3:22</a> Although these 7 churches were actual, historical churches in Asia Minor, they represent the types of churches that perennially exist throughout the church age.

Four great trade roads went through Ephesus; therefore, it became known as the gateway to Asia. It was the center of the worship of Artemis (Greek), or Diana (Roman), whose temple was one of the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World. Paul ministered there for 3 years ( <a ref='Acts 20:31'>Ac 20:31</a> ), and later met with the Ephesian elders on his way to Jerusalem ( <a ref='Ac 20'>Ac 20</a> ). Timothy, Tychicus, and the Apostle John all served this church. John was in Ephesus when he was arrested by Domitian and exiled 50 mi. southwest to Patmos. <b>seven stars.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:16'>1:16</a> .</i> <b>seven golden lampstands.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:12'>1:12</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 2:2'>2:2</a> <b>those who call themselves apostles.</b> The Ephesian church exercised spiritual discernment.

But the Ephesians’ passion and fervor for Christ had become cold, mechanical orthodoxy. Their doctrinal and moral purity, their undiminished zeal for the truth, and their disciplined service were no substitute for the love for Christ they had forsaken. <a ref='Revelation 2:5'>2:5</a> <b>remove your lampstand.</b> God’s judgment would bring an end to the Ephesian church. <a ref='Revelation 2:6'>2:6</a> <b>the deeds of the Nicolaitans.</b> A problem in Pergamum also (vv. <a ref='Revelation 2:12–15'>12–15</a> ), this heresy was similar to the teaching of Balaam (vv. <a ref='Revelation 2:14–15'>14–15</a> ). Nicolas means “one who conquers the people.” Irenaeus writes that Nicolas, who was made a deacon in <a ref='Ac 6'>Ac 6</a> , was a false believer who later became apostate; but because of his credentials he was able to lead the church astray. And, like Balaam, he led the people into immorality and wickedness. The Nicolaitans, followers of Nicolas, were involved in immorality and assaulted the church with sensual temptations. Clement of Alexander says, “They abandoned themselves to pleasure like goats, leading a life of self-indulgence.” Their teaching perverted grace and replaced liberty with license. <a ref='Revelation 2:7'>2:7</a> <b>him who overcomes.</b> According to John’s own definition, to be an overcomer is to be a Christian ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 John 5:4'>1Jn 5:4</a></i> ; cf. vv. <a ref='Revelation 2:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Revelation 2:17'>17</a> , <a ref='Revelation 2:26'>26</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 3:5'>3:5</a> , <a ref='Revelation 3:12'>12</a> , <a ref='Revelation 3:21'>21</a> ). <b>tree of life.</b> True believers enjoy the promise of heaven ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Revelation 22:2'>22:2</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 2:9'>Ge 2:9</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 2:8'>2:8</a> <b>angel.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Revelation 2:1'>1</a> .</i> <b>Smyrna.</b> Smyrna means “myrrh,” the substance used for perfume and often for anointing a dead body for aromatic purposes.

Pergamum (modern Bergama) was built on a 1,000-foot hill in a broad, fertile plain about 20 mi. inland from the Aegean Sea. It had served as the capital of the Roman province of Asia Minor for over 250 years. It was an important religious center for the pagan cults of Athena, Asklepios, Dionysius (or Bacchus, the god of drunkenness), and Zeus. It was the first city in Asia to build a temple to Caesar (29 BC) and became the capital of the cult of Caesar worship. <b>two-edged sword.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:16'>1:16</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 2:13'>2:13</a> <b>where Satan’s throne is.</b> The headquarters of satanic opposition and a Gentile base for false religions. On the acropolis in Pergamum was a huge, throne-shaped altar to Zeus. In addition, Asklepios, the god of healing, was the god most associated with Pergamum. His snake-like form is still the medical symbol today. The famous medical school connected to his temple mingled medicine with superstition. One prescription called for the worshiper to sleep on the temple floor, allowing snakes to crawl over his body and infuse him with their healing power. <b>Antipas.</b> Probably the pastor of the church. <b>faithful one.</b> Tradition says Antipas was burned to death inside a brass bull. “Faithful one,” or “martyr,” a transliteration of the Greek word, means “witness.” Because so many of the witnesses faithful to Christ were put to death, the word “martyr” developed its current definition. <a ref='Revelation 2:14'>2:14</a> <b>teaching of Balaam.</b> Balaam tried unsuccessfully to prostitute his prophetic gift and curse Israel for money offered him by Balak, king of Moab. So he devised a plot to have Moabite women seduce Israelite men into intermarriage. The result was the blasphemous union of Israel with fornication and idolatrous feasts (for the story of Balaam, see <a ref='Nu 22-25'>Nu 22–25</a> ). <b>things sacrificed to idols.</b> See <a ref='Acts 15:19–29'>Ac 15:19–29</a> . <a ref='Revelation 2:15'>2:15</a> <b>So you also.</b> The teaching of the Nicolaitans led to the same behavior as Balaam’s schemes. <b>teaching of the Nicolaitans.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Revelation 2:6'>6</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 2:16'>2:16</a> <b>sword of My mouth.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:16'>1:16</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 2:17'>2:17</a> <b>overcomes.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Revelation 2:7'>7</a> .</i> <b>hidden manna.</b> Just as Israel received manna, God promises to give the true believer the spiritual bread the unbelieving world cannot see: Jesus Christ (cf. <a ref='John 6:51'>Jn 6:51</a> ). <b>white stone.</b> When an athlete won in the games, he was often given, as part of his prize, a white stone which was an admission pass to the winner’s celebration afterwards.

Since the city was situated in a long valley that swept 40 mi. to Pergamum, it had no natural defenses and had a long history of being destroyed and rebuilt. Originally populated by soldiers of Alexander the Great, it was little more than a military outpost to guard Pergamum. Lydia came from this city on business and was converted under Paul’s ministry ( <a ref='Acts 16:14–15'>Ac 16:14–15</a> ). <b>eyes like a flame of fire.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:14'>1:14</a> .</i> <b>feet are like burnished bronze.</b> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 19:15'>19:15</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 1:15'>1:15</a></i> . <a ref='Revelation 2:20'>2:20</a> <b>Jezebel.</b> Probably a pseudonym for a woman who influenced the church in the way Jezebel influenced the OT Jews into idolatry and immorality (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 21:25–26'>1Ki 21:25–26</a> ). <b>immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols.</b> Cf. <a ref='Acts 15:19–29'>Ac 15:19–29</a> ; <i>see note on v. <a ref='Revelation 2:14'>14</a></i> . <a ref='Revelation 2:22'>2:22</a> <b>bed</b> of sickness <b>.</b> Lit. “bed.” Having given this woman time to repent, God was to judge her upon a bed.

Around 1200 BC it gained prominence as the capital of the Lydian kingdom. Its primary industry was harvesting wool, dying it, and making garments from it. The famous author, Aesop, came from Sardis, and tradition says that Melito, a member of the church in Sardis, wrote the first-ever commentary on certain passages in the book of Revelation. The church in Sardis was dead; that is, basically populated by unredeemed, unregenerate people. <b>seven Spirits.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:4'>1:4</a> .</i> <b>seven stars.</b> The pastors of these 7 churches ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Revelation 1:16'>1:16</a> , <a ref='Revelation 1:20'>20</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 3:3'>3:3</a> <b>come like a thief.</b> Here the reference is not to Christ’s second coming (cf. <a ref='Revelation 16:15'>16:15</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:2'>1Th 5:2</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 3:10'>2Pe 3:10</a> ), but to His sudden and unexpected coming to His unrepentant, dead church to inflict harm and destruction. <a ref='Revelation 3:4'>3:4</a> <b>who have not defiled their garments.</b> Defiled means “to smear,” “to pollute,” or “to stain,” and garments refer to character.

His unusual devotion to his brother earned the city its name, “brotherly love.” The city was an important commercial stop on a major trade route called the Imperial Post Road, a first-century mail route. Although Scripture does not mention this church elsewhere, it was probably the fruit of Paul’s extended ministry in Ephesus (cf. <a ref='Acts 19:10'>Ac 19:10</a> ). <b>holy … true.</b> A common description in this book ( <a ref='Revelation 4:8'>4:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 6:10'>6:10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 15:3'>15:3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:7'>16:7</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:2'>19:2</a> , <a ref='Revelation 19:11'>11</a> ).

This period is described in detail throughout chaps. <a ref='Rev 6-19'>6–19</a> . The latter half is called “the great tribulation” ( <a ref='Revelation 7:14'>7:14</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:21'>Mt 24:21</a> ) and is identified as to time in <a ref='Revelation 11:2–3'>11:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:6'>12:6</a> , <a ref='Revelation 12:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:5'>13:5</a> . The verb “keep” is followed by a preposition whose normal meaning is “from” or “out of”—this phrase, “keep … from” supports the pretribulational rapture of the church ( <i>see notes on <a ref='John 14:1–3'>Jn 14:1–3</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:51–52'>1Co 15:51–52</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:13–17'>1Th 4:13–17</a></i> ).

It was primarily known for 3 industries: banking, wool, and medicine (notably its eye salve). An inadequate local water supply forced the city to build an underground aqueduct. All 3 industries, as well as the inadequate water supply, played a major part in this letter. The church began through the ministry of Epaphras, while Paul was ministering in Ephesus (cf. <a ref='Colossians 1:7'>Col 1:7</a> ; Paul never personally visited Laodicea). <b>the Amen.</b> A common biblical expression signifying certainty and veracity (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 65:16'>Is 65:16</a> , “the God of truth”). According to <a ref='2 Corinthians 1:20'>2Co 1:20</a> , all the promises of God are fulfilled in Christ; that is, all God’s promises and unconditional covenants are guaranteed and affirmed by the person and work of Jesus Christ. <b>faithful and true Witness.</b> He is a completely trustworthy and perfectly accurate witness to the truth of God ( <a ref='John 14:6'>Jn 14:6</a> ). <b>Beginning of the creation.</b> This corrects a heresy, apparently present in Laodicea as in Colossae, that Christ was a created being (cf. <a ref='Colossians 1:15–20'>Col 1:15–20</a> ). Instead, He is the “Beginning” (lit. “beginner, originator, initiator”) of creation (cf. <a ref='John 1:3'>Jn 1:3</a> ) and the “firstborn of creation”; that is, the most preeminent, supreme person ever born ( <a ref='Colossians 1:15'>Col 1:15</a> ). As a man, He had a beginning, but as God, He was the beginning. Sadly, this heresy concerning the person of Christ had produced an unregenerate church in Laodicea. <a ref='Revelation 3:16'>3:16</a> <b>lukewarm.</b> I.e., tepid. Nearby Hierapolis was famous for its hot springs, and Colossae for its cold, refreshing mountain stream. But Laodicea had dirty, tepid water that flowed for miles through an underground aqueduct. Visitors, unaccustomed to it, immediately spat it out. The church at Laodicea was neither cold, openly rejecting Christ, nor hot, filled with spiritual zeal. Instead, its members were lukewarm, hypocrites professing to know Christ, but not truly belonging to Him (cf. <a ref='Matthew 7:21'>Mt 7:21ff.</a> ). <b>I will spit you out of My mouth.</b> Just like the dirty, tepid water of Laodicea, these self-deceived hypocrites sickened Christ. <a ref='Revelation 3:18'>3:18</a> <b>gold … white garments … eye salve.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Revelation 3:14'>14</a> .</i> He was offering them the spiritual counterparts to their 3 major industries.

And “reprove” and “discipline” often refer to God’s convicting and punishing the unregenerate ( <a ref='Matthew 18:17'>Mt 18:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 14:24'>1Co 14:24</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 2:25'>2Ti 2:25</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 3:20'>3:20</a> <b>I stand at the door and knock.</b> Rather than allowing for the common interpretation of Christ’s knocking on a person’s heart, the context demands that Christ was seeking to enter this church that bore His name but lacked a single true believer. This poignant letter was His knocking. If one member would recognize his spiritual bankruptcy and respond in saving faith, He would enter the church. <a ref='Revelation 3:21'>3:21</a> <b>overcomes.</b> All true Christians ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 2:7'>2:7</a></i> ). <b>sit down with Me on My throne.</b> A figurative expression meaning that we will share the privilege and authority that Christ enjoys as we reign with Him ( <a ref='Revelation 1:6'>1:6</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 19:28'>Mt 19:28</a> ; <a ref='Luke 22:29–30'>Lk 22:29–30</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 4:1'>4:1</a> <b>Come up here.</b> This is not a veiled reference to the rapture of the church, but a command for John to be temporarily transported to heaven “in the Spirit” ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 1:10'>1:10</a></i> ) to receive revelation about future events. <b>what must take place after these things.</b> According to the outline given in <a ref='Revelation 1:19'>1:19</a> , this begins the third and final section of the book, describing the events that will follow the church age. <a ref='Revelation 4:2'>4:2</a> <b>I was in the Spirit.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:10'>1:10</a> .</i> <b>throne.</b> Not so much a piece of furniture, but a symbol of sovereign rule and authority ( <a ref='Revelation 7:15'>7:15</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:19'>11:19</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:17–18'>16:17–18</a> ; cf. <a ref='Isaiah 6:1'>Is 6:1</a> ). It is the focus of chap. <a ref='Rev 4'>4</a> , occurring 14 times, 11 times referring to God’s throne. <a ref='Revelation 4:3'>4:3</a> <b>jasper.</b> John later describes this stone as “crystal-clear” ( <a ref='Revelation 21:11'>21:11</a> ), probably referring to a diamond, which refracts all the colors of the spectrum in wondrous brilliance. <b>sardius.</b> A fiery bright ruby stone named for the city near which it was found. <b>emerald.</b> A cool, emerald-green hue dominates the multicolored rainbow surrounding God’s throne (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 1:28'>Eze 1:28</a> ). From the time of Noah, the rainbow became a sign of God’s faithfulness to His Word, His promises, and His Noahic covenant ( <a ref='Genesis 9:12–17'>Ge 9:12–17</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 4:4'>4:4</a> <b>twenty-four elders.</b> Their joint rule with Christ, their white garments, and their golden crowns all seem to indicate that these 24 represent the redeemed (vv. <a ref='Revelation 4:9–11'>9–11</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 5:5–14'>5:5–14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 7:11–17'>7:11–17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:16–18'>11:16–18</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:3'>14:3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:4'>19:4</a> ). The question is which redeemed? Not Israel, since the nation is not yet saved, glorified, and coronated. That is still to come at this point in the events of the end. Their resurrection and glory will come at the end of the 7-year tribulation time (cf. <a ref='Daniel 12:1–3'>Da 12:1–3</a> ). Tribulation saints aren’t yet saved ( <a ref='Revelation 7:9–10'>7:9–10</a> ). Only one group will be complete and glorified at that point—the church. Here elders represent the church, which sings the song of redemption ( <a ref='Revelation 5:8–10'>5:8–10</a> ). They are the overcomers who have their crowns and live in the place prepared for them, where they have gone with Jesus (cf. <a ref='John 14:1–4'>Jn 14:1–4</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 4:5'>4:5</a> <b>lightning … thunder.</b> Not the fury of nature, but the firestorm of righteous fury about to come from an awesome, powerful God upon a sinful world ( <a ref='Revelation 8:5'>8:5</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:19'>11:19</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:18'>16:18</a> ). <b>seven Spirits of God.</b> The Holy Spirit ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 1:4'>1:4</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 4:6'>4:6</a> <b>sea of glass.</b> There is no sea in heaven ( <a ref='Revelation 21:1'>21:1</a> ), but the crystal pavement that serves as the floor of God’s throne stretches out like a great, glistening sea (cf. <a ref='Exodus 24:10'>Ex 24:10</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 1:22'>Eze 1:22</a> ). <b>four living creatures.</b> Lit. “four living ones or beings.” These are the cherubim (sing., cherub), those angels frequently referred to in the OT in connection with God’s presence, power, and holiness. Although John’s description is not identical to Ezekiel’s, they are obviously both referring to the same supernatural and indescribable beings ( <a ref='Psalms 80:1'>Pss 80:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 99:1'>99:1</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Ezekiel 1:4–25'>Eze 1:4–25</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 10:15'>10:15</a></i> ). <b>full of eyes.</b> Although not omniscient—an attribute reserved for God alone—these angels have a comprehensive knowledge and perception. Nothing escapes their scrutiny (cf. v. <a ref='Revelation 4:8'>8</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 4:7'>4:7</a> <b>first … like a lion.</b> In what is obviously intended as symbolic language, John compares these 4 beings with 4 of God’s earthly creations. Ezekiel indicates that every cherub has these 4 attributes. The likeness to a lion symbolizes strength and power. <b>second … like a calf.</b> The image of a calf demonstrates that these beings render humble service to God. <b>third … face like that of a man.</b> Their likeness to man shows they are rational beings. <b>fourth … like a flying eagle.</b> The cherubim fulfill their service to God with the swiftness of eagles’ wings. <a ref='Revelation 4:8'>4:8</a> <b>full of eyes.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Revelation 4:6'>6</a> .</i> Holy, holy, holy <b>.</b> Often God is extolled for His holiness in this 3-fold form, because it is the summation of all that He is—His most salient attribute ( <i>see note on <a ref='Isaiah 6:3'>Is 6:3</a></i> ). who was and who is and who is to come <b>.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:4'>1:4</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 4:10'>4:10</a> <b>cast their crowns.</b> Aware that God alone is responsible for the rewards they have received, they divest themselves of all honor and cast it at the feet of their King ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 2:10'>2:10</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 4:11'>4:11</a> <b>You created all things.</b> It is the Creator God who set out to redeem His creation. <a ref='Revelation 5:1'>5:1</a> <b>a scroll.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:11'>1:11</a> .</i> <b>written inside and on the back.</b> This is typical of various kinds of contracts in the ancient world, including deeds, marriage contracts, rental and lease agreements, and wills. The inside of the scroll contained all the details of the contract, and the outside—or back—contained a summary of the document. In this case it almost certainly is a deed—the title deed to the earth (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:7'>Jer 32:7ff.</a> ) <b>sealed up with seven seals.</b> Romans sealed their wills 7 times—on the edge at each roll—to prevent unauthorized entry. Hebrew title deeds required a minimum of 3 witnesses and 3 separate seals, with more important transactions requiring more witnesses and seals. <a ref='Revelation 5:2'>5:2</a> <b>strong angel.</b> The identity of this angel is uncertain, but it may refer to the angel Gabriel, whose name means “strength of God” ( <a ref='Daniel 8:16'>Da 8:16</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 5:3'>5:3</a> <b>in heaven or on the earth or under the earth.</b> A common biblical expression denoting the entire universe and not intended to teach 3 precise divisions. <a ref='Revelation 5:5'>5:5</a> <b>the Lion … from the tribe of Judah.</b> One of the earliest titles for the Messiah ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Genesis 49:8–12'>Ge 49:8–12</a></i> ), it speaks of His fierceness and strength, which although glimpsed in His first coming, do not appear in their fullness until the moment anticipated here. <b>the Root of David.</b> Another clearly messianic title ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Isaiah 11:1–10'>Is 11:1–10</a></i> ), it anticipates His being a descendant of David, who with devastating force will compel the wicked of the earth to succumb to His authority. <a ref='Revelation 5:6'>5:6</a> <b>Lamb.</b> Hearing of a lion, John turns to see a lamb (lit. “a little, pet lamb”). God required the Jews to bring the Passover lamb into their houses for 4 days, essentially making it a pet, before it was to be violently slain ( <a ref='Exodus 12:3'>Ex 12:3</a> , <a ref='Exodus 12:6'>6</a> ). This is the true Passover Lamb, God’s Son (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 53:7'>Is 53:7</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 11:19'>Jer 11:19</a> ; <a ref='John 1:29'>Jn 1:29</a> ). <b>as if slain.</b> The scars from its slaughter are still clearly visible, but it is standing—it is alive. <b>seven horns.</b> In Scripture, horns always symbolize power, because in the animal kingdom they are used to exert power and inflict wounds in combat. Seven horns signify complete or perfect power. Unlike other defenseless lambs, this One has complete, sovereign power. <b>seven eyes … seven Spirits.</b> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 4:5'>4:5</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 1:4'>1:4</a></i> . <a ref='Revelation 5:8'>5:8</a> <b>harp.</b> These ancient stringed instruments not only accompanied the songs of God’s people ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 25:6'>1Chr 25:6</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 33:2'>Ps 33:2</a> ), but also accompanied prophecy (cf. <a ref='1 Samuel 10:5'>1Sa 10:5</a> ). The 24 elders, representative of the redeemed church, played their harps in praise and in a symbolic indication that all the prophets had said was about to be fulfilled. <b>bowls full of incense.</b> These golden, wide-mouth saucers were common in the tabernacle and temple. Incense was a normal part of the OT ritual. Priests stood twice daily before the inner veil of the temple and burned incense so that the smoke would carry into the Holy of Holies and be swept into the nostrils of God. That symbolized the people’s prayers rising to Him. <b>prayers of the saints.</b> Specifically, these prayers represent all that the redeemed have ever prayed concerning ultimate and final redemption. <a ref='Revelation 5:9'>5:9</a> <b>new song.</b> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 15:3'>15:3</a> . The OT is filled with references to a new song that flows from a heart that has experienced God’s redemption or deliverance (cf. <a ref='Revelation 14:3'>14:3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 33:3'>Pss 33:3</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 96:1'>96:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 144:9'>144:9</a> ). This new song anticipates the final, glorious redemption that God is about to begin. <b>purchased for God with Your blood.</b> The sacrificial death of Christ on behalf of sinners made Him worthy to take the scroll (cf. <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:20'>1Co 6:20</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 7:23'>7:23</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:21'>2Co 5:21</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 3:13'>Ga 3:13</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:18–19'>1Pe 1:18–19</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 2:1'>2Pe 2:1</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 5:10'>5:10</a> <b>a kingdom and priests.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:6'>1:6</a> .</i> <b>reign upon the earth.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 20:2'>20:2</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 5:11'>5:11</a> <b>myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands.</b> The number is to express an amount beyond calculation. The Greek expression can also be translated “innumerable” or “many thousands” ( <a ref='Luke 12:1'>Lk 12:1</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 12:22'>Heb 12:22</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 5:12'>5:12</a> <b>power … and blessing.</b> This doxology records 7 qualities intrinsic to God and to the Lamb that demand our praise. <a ref='Revelation 5:13'>5:13</a> <b>in heaven and on the earth and under the earth.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Revelation 5:3'>3</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 5:14'>5:14</a> <b>four living creatures.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 4:6'>4:6</a> .</i> <b>elders.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 4:4'>4:4</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 6:1–19:21'>6:1—19:21</a> This lengthy section details the judgments and events of the time of tribulation ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Revelation 3:10'>3:10</a></i> ) from its beginning with the opening of the first seal (vv. <a ref='Revelation 6:1–2'>1–2</a> ) through the 7 seal, trumpet, and bowl judgments to the return of Christ to destroy the ungodly ( <a ref='Revelation 19:11–21'>19:11–21</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 6:1'>6:1</a> <b>the seven seals.</b> In chap. <a ref='Rev 5'>5</a> , Christ was the only One found worthy to open the little scroll—the title deed to the universe. As He breaks the 7 seals that secure the scroll, each seal unleashes a new demonstration of God’s judgment on the earth in the future tribulation period ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Revelation 5:1'>5:1</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:3–9'>Mt 24:3–9</a></i> ). These seal judgments include all the judgments to the end. The seventh seal contains the 7 trumpets; the seventh trumpet contains the 7 bowls. <a ref='Revelation 6:2'>6:2</a> <b>white horse.</b> The animal represents an unparalleled time of world peace—a false peace that is to be short-lived ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Revelation 6:4'>4</a></i> ). This peace will be ushered in by a series of false messiahs, culminating with the Antichrist ( <a ref='Matthew 24:3–5'>Mt 24:3–5</a> ). <b>he who sits on it.</b> The 4 horses and their riders do not represent specific individuals, but forces. Some, however, identify this rider with Antichrist. Although he will be the leading figure, John’s point is that the entire world will follow him, being obsessed with pursuing this false peace. <b>bow.</b> The bow is a symbol of war, but the absence of arrows implies that this victory is a bloodless one—a peace won by covenant and agreement, not by war (cf. <a ref='Daniel 9:24–27'>Da 9:24–27</a> ). <b>crown.</b> This word refers to the kind of laurel wreath awarded winning athletes. It “was given to him.” Antichrist becomes king, elected by the world’s inhabitants regardless of the cost, and will conquer the entire earth in a bloodless coup. <a ref='Revelation 6:4'>6:4</a> <b>another, a red horse.</b> Its blood-red appearance speaks of the holocaust of war (cf. <a ref='Matthew 24:7'>Mt 24:7</a> ). God will grant this horse and its rider the power to create worldwide war. But as horrible as this judgment is, it will be only the “birth pains,” the beginning pains of God’s wrath ( <a ref='Matthew 24:8'>Mt 24:8</a> ; <a ref='Mark 13:7–8'>Mk 13:7–8</a> ; <a ref='Luke 21:9'>Lk 21:9</a> ). men <b>would slay one another.</b> Violent slaughter will become commonplace. <b>sword.</b> Not the long, broad sword, but the shorter, more easily maneuvered one that assassins often used and that soldiers carried into battle. It depicts assassination, revolt, massacre, and wholesale slaughter (cf. <a ref='Daniel 8:24'>Da 8:24</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 6:5'>6:5</a> <b>black horse.</b> Black signifies famine (cf. <a ref='Lamentations 5:8–10'>Lam 5:8–10</a> ). Worldwide war will destroy the food supply which spawns global hunger. <b>pair of scales.</b> The common measuring device—two small trays hung from each end of a balance beam—indicates that the scarcity of food will lead to rationing and food lines. <a ref='Revelation 6:6'>6:6</a> <b>choinix of wheat.</b> The approximate amount necessary to sustain one person for one day. <b>denarius.</b> One day’s normal wage. One day’s work will provide enough food for only one person. <b>three choinix of barley.</b> Usually fed to animals, this grain was low in nutrients and cheaper than wheat. A day’s wage provides enough for only a small family’s daily supply. <b>oil and the wine.</b> Although the point could be that these foods will not be affected by the famine, a more straightforward meaning is that bare staples—oil was used in the preparation of bread, and wine was considered necessary for cooking and purifying water—suddenly will become luxuries that have to be carefully protected. <a ref='Revelation 6:8'>6:8</a> <b>pale horse.</b> “Pale,” the Greek word from which the English word “chlorophyll” comes, describes the pale, ashen-green, pallor characteristic of the decomposition of a corpse. God grants this horseman the authority to bring death to 25 percent of the world’s population. <b>Hades.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Luke 16:23'>Lk 16:23</a> .</i> The place of the dead, which is identified as a common and fitting partner for death ( <a ref='Revelation 20:13'>20:13</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 1:18'>1:18</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 6:9'>6:9</a> <b>fifth seal.</b> This seal describes the force of the saints’ prayers for God’s vengeance. Its events will begin in the first half and mark the midpoint and events following, in the 7-year period, which is called the Great Tribulation ( <a ref='Revelation 2:22'>2:22</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 7:14'>7:14</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>Da 9:27</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:15'>Mt 24:15</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:3–4'>2Th 2:3–4</a></i> ). The second 3 1/2 -year period ( <a ref='Revelation 11:2'>11:2</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:6'>12:6</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:5'>13:5</a> ) features the day of the Lord, in which God unleashes His judgment and wrath on the earth in intensifying waves ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:2'>1Th 5:2</a></i> ). <b>underneath the altar.</b> Probably a reference to the altar of incense, which pictured the saints’ prayers ascending to God ( <a ref='Revelation 5:8'>5:8</a> ; cf. <a ref='Exodus 40:5'>Ex 40:5</a> ). <b>the souls of those who had been slain.</b> Christians martyred for their faith (cf. <a ref='Revelation 7:9'>7:9</a> , <a ref='Revelation 7:13–15'>13–15</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 17:6'>17:6</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:9–14'>Mt 24:9–14</a> ; see also <a ref='Mark 13:9–13'>Mk 13:9–13</a> ; <a ref='Luke 21:12–19'>Lk 21:12–19</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 6:11'>6:11</a> <b>white robe.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 3:4'>3:4</a> .</i> <b>rest for a little while longer.</b> God will answer their prayer for vengeance, but in His time. <b>until</b> the number <b>… would be completed.</b> God has predetermined the number of the righteous whose death He will allow before moving to destroy the rebels. <a ref='Revelation 6:12'>6:12</a> <b>sixth seal.</b> The force described in this seal is overpowering fear (cf. <a ref='Luke 21:26'>Lk 21:26</a> ). While the first 5 seals will result from human activity God used to accomplish His purposes, at this point He begins direct intervention (cf. <a ref='Matthew 24:29'>Mt 24:29</a> ; <a ref='Luke 21:25'>Lk 21:25</a> ). The previous 5 seals will be precursors to the full fury of the day of the Lord which will begin with the sixth seal (v. <a ref='Revelation 6:17'>17</a> ). The events described in this seal unleash the seventh, which contains the trumpet judgments (chaps. <a ref='Rev 8-9'>8–9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:15'>11:15ff.</a> ) and the bowl judgments (chap. <a ref='Rev 16'>16</a> ). <b>great earthquake.</b> There have been many earthquakes prior to this ( <a ref='Matthew 24:7'>Mt 24:7</a> ), but this will be more than an earthquake. All the earth’s faults will begin to fracture simultaneously, resulting in a cataclysmic, global earthquake. <b>moon became like blood.</b> Accompanying the earthquake will be numerous volcanic eruptions; and large amounts of ash and debris will be blown into the earth’s atmosphere, blackening the sun and giving the moon a blood-red hue (cf. <a ref='Zechariah 14:6–7'>Zec 14:6–7</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 6:13'>6:13</a> <b>stars of the sky fell.</b> The word “stars” can refer to any celestial body, large or small, and is not limited to normal English usage. The best explanation is a massive asteroid or meteor shower. <b>unripe figs.</b> Winter figs that grow without the protection of leaves and are easily blown from the tree. <a ref='Revelation 6:14'>6:14</a> <b>sky was split apart like a scroll.</b> The earth’s atmosphere will be somehow dramatically affected and the sky as we know it disappears (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 34:4'>Is 34:4</a> ). <b>every mountain and island were moved.</b> Under the stress created by the global earthquake, great segments of the earth’s plates will begin to slip and shift, realigning whole continents. <a ref='Revelation 6:16'>6:16</a> <b>wrath of the Lamb.</b> Earth’s inhabitants will recognize for the first time the source of all their trouble ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 9:6'>9:6</a></i> ). Incredibly, prior to this they will be living life as usual ( <a ref='Matthew 24:37–39'>Mt 24:37–39</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 6:17'>6:17</a> <b>great</b> day <b>.</b> The sixth seal will commence what the prophets call “the Day of the Lord.” See Introduction to Joel: Historical and Theological Themes . <a ref='Revelation 7:1–17'>7:1–17</a> Chapter <a ref='Rev 7'>7</a> forms a parenthesis between the sixth seal ( <a ref='Revelation 6:12–17'>6:12–17</a> ) and the seventh seal ( <a ref='Revelation 8:1'>8:1</a> ) and answers the question posed at the end of chap. <a ref='Rev 6'>6</a> . Two distinct groups will survive the divine fury: 1) 144,000 Jewish evangelists on earth (vv. <a ref='Revelation 7:1–8'>1–8</a> ) and 2) their converts in heaven (vv. <a ref='Revelation 7:9–17'>9–17</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 7:1'>7:1</a> <b>four corners.</b> The 4 quadrants of the compass; that is, the angels will take up key positions on earth. <b>four winds.</b> A figurative expression, indicating all the earth’s winds—those from south, east, north, and west. The 4 angels will turn off, for a brief interlude, the essential engine of our earth’s atmosphere. <a ref='Revelation 7:2'>7:2</a> <b>seal of the living God.</b> “Seal” often refers to a signet ring used to press its image into wax melted on a document. The resulting imprint implied authenticity and ownership and protected the contents (cf. <a ref='Revelation 9:4'>9:4</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 9:3–4'>Eze 9:3–4</a> ).

During the 7-year period they will be saved, martyred, and enter heaven. Though it is a time of unparalleled judgment, it is also a time of unparalleled grace in salvation (cf. <a ref='Matthew 24:12–14'>Mt 24:12–14</a> ). <b>washed their robes.</b> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 19:8'>19:8</a> .

In the final, eternal state with its new heavens and earth, there is no temple; God Himself, who will fill all, will be its temple ( <a ref='Revelation 21:22'>21:22</a> ). <b>dwell over them.</b> God’s presence will become their canopy of shelter to protect them from all the terrors of a fallen world and the indescribable horrors they have experienced on the earth during the time of tribulation. <a ref='Revelation 7:17'>7:17</a> <b>shepherd.</b> In a beautiful mix of images, the Lamb has always been the Shepherd ( <a ref='Ps 23'>Ps 23</a> ; <a ref='John 10:14'>Jn 10:14ff.</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 13:20'>Heb 13:20</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 8:1'>8:1</a> <b>the seventh seal.</b> This seal includes not only an earthquake, but the 7 trumpet judgments ( <a ref='Revelation 8:1–9:21'>8:1—9:21</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:15'>11:15ff.</a> ) and the 7 bowl judgments ( <a ref='Revelation 16:1–21'>16:1–21</a> ), with the bowl judgments flowing out of the seventh trumpet and coming in rapid succession just before Christ’s return ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 6:1'>6:1</a></i> ). <b>silence in heaven.</b> The silence of awe and anticipation at the grim reality of the judgments God is about to unleash. <a ref='Revelation 8:2'>8:2</a> <b>seven trumpets.</b> In Revelation, trumpets primarily announce impending judgment. The trumpets are of greater intensity than the seals, but not as destructive as the final bowl judgments will be (cf. <a ref='Revelation 16:1–21'>16:1–21</a> ). They occur during the final 3 1/2 years, but the time of each is indefinite, except the effects of the fifth trumpet judgment, which will last 5 months ( <a ref='Revelation 9:10'>9:10</a> ). The first 4 announce the divine destruction of earth’s ecology (vv. <a ref='Revelation 8:6–12'>6–12</a> ), while the final 3 involve demonic devastation of earth’s inhabitants ( <a ref='Revelation 9:1–21'>9:1–21</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:15'>11:15ff.</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 8:3'>8:3</a> <b>censer.</b> A golden pan, suspended on a rope or chain, that was used to transport fiery coals from the brazen altar to the altar of incense, in order to ignite the incense, symbolizing the prayers of the people ( <a ref='Revelation 5:8'>5:8</a> ; <a ref='Exodus 27:3'>Ex 27:3</a> ; cf. <a ref='Luke 1:8–9'>Lk 1:8–9</a> ).

The steam and water thrown into the sky by such eruptions could easily condense into hail and fall to earth along with the fiery lava (cf. <a ref='Exodus 9:13–25'>Ex 9:13–25</a> ). Dust and gases may so contaminate falling liquid water that it appears blood red. <b>a third of the trees were burned up.</b> The lava storm will create a blazing fire that devastates one-third of the earth’s forests. <a ref='Revelation 8:8'>8:8</a> <b>like a great mountain.</b> Probably a huge meteor or asteroid surrounded by gases that will ignite as it enters earth’s atmosphere. Its impact will create a tidal wave, destroying one-third of the world’s ships. <b>sea became blood.</b> This may refer to an event known as red tides, caused by billions of dead micro-organisms poisoning the water—in this case the result of the meteor’s collision. Or it may be actual blood, a clear act of eschatological judgment. <a ref='Revelation 8:10'>8:10</a> <b>great star fell.</b> Another celestial body, perhaps a comet in this case, since it leaves a fiery trail ( <i>see notes on v. <a ref='Revelation 8:8'>8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 6:13'>6:13</a></i> ). It will disintegrate as it nears the earth, scattering over the globe. <a ref='Revelation 8:11'>8:11</a> <b>Wormwood.</b> A bitter, poisonous substance, derived from a root, that causes drunkenness and eventually death ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 29:18'>Dt 29:18</a> ; <a ref='Proverbs 5:4'>Pr 5:4</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 9:15'>Jer 9:15</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 3:15'>Lam 3:15</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 8:12'>8:12</a> <b>a third of the sun … struck.</b> God will supernaturally reduce the intensity of the celestial bodies by one-third.

But this is temporary (cf. <a ref='Revelation 16:8–9'>16:8–9</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 8:13'>8:13</a> <b>Woe, woe, woe.</b> One for each remaining trumpet blast. Although the first 4 trumpets are unimaginable, they will be nothing like the 3 to come ( <a ref='Revelation 9:1–21'>9:1–21</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:15'>11:15ff.</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 9:1'>9:1</a> <b>a star from heaven which had fallen.</b> Unlike the other stars that will have fallen ( <a ref='Revelation 6:13'>6:13</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 8:8'>8:8</a> ), this one will be an angelic being (cf. v. <a ref='Revelation 9:2'>2</a> )—probably Satan himself (v. <a ref='Revelation 9:4'>4</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:7'>12:7</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Isaiah 14:12–14'>Is 14:12–14</a> ; <a ref='Luke 10:18'>Lk 10:18</a></i> ). <b>pit of the abyss.</b> Mentioned 7 times in Revelation, it always refers to the prison where some of the demonic hordes are incarcerated, the place of severest torment and isolation (vv. <a ref='Revelation 9:1–2'>1–2</a> , <a ref='Revelation 9:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:7'>11:7</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 17:8'>17:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:1'>20:1</a> , <a ref='Revelation 20:3'>3</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='2 Peter 2:4'>2Pe 2:4</a> ; <a ref='Jude 1:6–7'>Jd 6–7</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 9:3'>9:3</a> <b>locusts.</b> A grasshopper-like insect that descends in swarms so thick they can obscure the sun and strip bare all vegetation. In the 1950s a locust swarm devoured every growing thing for several hundred thousand square miles in the Middle East. These are not normal locusts, however, but specially prepared ones that are merely the outward form of demons, who, like locusts, will bring swarming desolation ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Joel 2:2'>Joel 2:2</a> , <a ref='Joel 2:4'>4</a></i> ). “Like” appears several times in John’s description; he finds it difficult to describe what he sees in a way the reader can understand. <b>scorpions.</b> An arachnid that inhabits warm, dry regions and has an erect tail tipped with a venomous stinger. A scorpion’s victim often rolls on the ground in agony, foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth in pain. The demons in locust form are able to inflict the physical—and perhaps, spiritual—pain like the scorpion (v. <a ref='Revelation 9:5'>5</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 9:4'>9:4</a> <b>men who do not have the seal of God.</b> Everyone on earth except the two groups mentioned in chap. <a ref='Rev 7'>7</a> —the 144,000 Jewish evangelists and their converts ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 7:4'>7:4</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 9:5'>9:5</a> <b>five months.</b> The normal life cycle of locusts is 5 months, usually from May to Sep. <a ref='Revelation 9:6'>9:6</a> <b>seek death and will never find it.</b> The tormented will find no relief. Even their unimaginable attempts to end their misery in suicide will be unsuccessful. <a ref='Revelation 9:7'>9:7</a> <b>faces of men.</b> Probably a reference to these demonic creatures as rational, intelligent beings. <a ref='Revelation 9:8'>9:8</a> <b>hair of women.</b> <a ref='Jeremiah 51:27'>Jeremiah 51:27</a> refers to locusts having bristles like hair. teeth <b>of lions.</b> They are fierce, powerful, and deadly (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:27'>Jer 51:27</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 9:9'>9:9</a> <b>breastplates of iron.</b> Breastplates were designed to protect the vital organs and sustain the life of the warrior. These creatures are invulnerable. <a ref='Revelation 9:10'>9:10</a> <b>five months.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Revelation 9:5'>5</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 9:11'>9:11</a> <b>Abaddon … Apollyon.</b> Although locusts normally have no king ( <a ref='Proverbs 30:27'>Pr 30:27</a> ), these demonic creatures do. His name in both Hebrew and Greek means “destroyer.” There is a hierarchy of power among the demons, just as among the holy angels. Apparently, “the angel of the abyss” is one of Satan’s most trusted leaders or possibly Satan himself. <a ref='Revelation 9:12'>9:12</a> <b>One woe.</b> The first of the final 3 trumpets ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 8:13'>8:13</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 9:13'>9:13</a> <b>horns of the golden altar.</b> God’s design for the golden altar of incense included small protrusions (horns) on each corner ( <a ref='Exodus 30:2'>Ex 30:2</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 6:9'>6:9</a></i> ). Normally a place of mercy, as God responds to His people’s prayers, the altar will resound with a cry for vengeance. <a ref='Revelation 9:14'>9:14</a> <b>four angels.</b> Scripture never refers to holy angels as being bound. These are fallen angels—another segment of Satan’s force whom God had bound but will free to accomplish His judgment through their horsemen (vv. <a ref='Revelation 9:15–19'>15–19</a> ). God’s control extends even to the demonic forces—they are bound or freed at His command. <b>Euphrates.</b> One of the 4 rivers that flowed through the Garden of Eden ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 16:12'>16:12</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Genesis 2:14'>Ge 2:14</a> ). Starting with Babel, this region has spawned many of the world’s pagan religions. <a ref='Revelation 9:15'>9:15</a> <b>the hour and day and month and year.</b> God works according to His predetermined plan (cf. <a ref='Matthew 24:36'>Mt 24:36</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:7'>Ac 1:7</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 9:16'>9:16</a> <b>the armies.</b> Some see this as a reference to forces accompanying the kings of the east ( <a ref='Revelation 16:12'>16:12</a> ) and identify them with a human army coming from Asia. But that event occurs in connection with the seventh trumpet, not the sixth. The language is better understood as referring to a demon force that makes war with the earth’s inhabitants and kills one-third of humanity (v. <a ref='Revelation 9:15'>15</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 9:17'>9:17</a> <b>breastplates.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Revelation 9:9'>9</a> .</i> <b>brimstone.</b> Brimstone is a yellowish, sulfuric rock that often attends fire and smoke in Revelation ( <a ref='Revelation 14:10'>14:10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:20'>19:20</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:10'>20:10</a> ). Common in the Dead Sea region, when ignited such deposits melt and produce burning streams and suffocating gas. <a ref='Revelation 9:19'>9:19</a> <b>tails are like serpents, having heads.</b> John’s language represents the demons’ ability to vent their destructive power in both directions. <a ref='Revelation 9:20–21'>9:20–21</a> God lists 5 sins that are representative of their defiance. <a ref='Revelation 9:20'>9:20</a> <b>demons.</b> Reminiscent of Paul’s comments about idolatry ( <i>see note on <a ref='1 Corinthians 10:19–20'>1Co 10:19–20</a></i> ); demons impersonate the stone and wood idols men make. <a ref='Revelation 9:21'>9:21</a> <b>they did not repent.</b> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 16:9'>16:9</a> , <a ref='Revelation 16:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Revelation 16:21'>21</a> . <b>sorceries.</b> This Greek word is the root of the English word “pharmacy.” Drugs in the ancient world were used to dull the senses and induce a state suitable for religious experiences such as séances, witchcraft, incantations, and cavorting with mediums ( <a ref='Revelation 21:8'>21:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 22:15'>22:15</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Ephesians 5:18'>Eph 5:18</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 10:1–11:14'>10:1—11:14</a> These verses serve as an interlude between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet ( <a ref='Revelation 11:15'>11:15</a> ). The seals and the bowls also have a brief interlude between their sixth and seventh judgments ( <a ref='Revelation 7:1–17'>7:1–17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:15'>16:15</a> ). God’s intention is to encourage and comfort His people in the midst of the fury and to remind them that He is still sovereign, that He remembers His people, and that they will ultimately be victorious. <a ref='Revelation 10:1'>10:1</a> <b>another strong angel.</b> Many commentators understand this to be Jesus Christ. But the Greek word translated “another” means one of the same kind, that is, a created being. This is not one of the 7 angels responsible for sounding the trumpets ( <a ref='Revelation 8:2'>8:2</a> ), but one of the highest ranking in heaven, filled with splendor, greatness, and strength (cf. <a ref='Revelation 5:2'>5:2</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 8:3'>8:3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 18:1'>18:1</a> ). <b>rainbow.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 4:3'>4:3</a> .</i> Perhaps God included this to remind John, that even in judgment, He will always remember His Noahic Covenant and protect His own. <b>feet like pillars of fire.</b> This angel’s feet and legs indicate the firm resolve with which he will execute the day of the Lord. <a ref='Revelation 10:2'>10:2</a> <b>little scroll.</b> The 7-sealed scroll that is the title deed to the earth ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 5:1'>5:1</a></i> ) will be fully opened and all the final judgments made visible. <b>right foot on the sea and his left on the earth.</b> Although Satan has temporarily usurped the sea and the earth, this symbolic act demonstrates that all creation belongs to the Lord and He rules it with sovereign authority. <a ref='Revelation 10:3'>10:3</a> <b>seven peals of thunder.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 4:5'>4:5</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Revelation 6:1'>6:1</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 8:5'>8:5</a> . <a ref='Revelation 10:4'>10:4</a> <b>Seal up.</b> John was told he must conceal the message of the 7 thunders until God’s time (cf. <a ref='Revelation 22:10'>22:10</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 8:26–27'>Da 8:26–27</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 12:9'>12:9</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 10:5'>10:5</a> <b>lifted up his right hand.</b> This Greek verb appears often in the technical sense of raising the hand to take an oath or a solemn vow (cf. <a ref='Daniel 12:7'>Da 12:7</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Matthew 5:33–34'>Mt 5:33–34</a></i> ). The hand is raised toward heaven because that is where God dwells. The angel is taking an oath. <a ref='Revelation 10:6'>10:6</a> <b>there will be delay no longer.</b> This initiates the last plagues of the Day of the Lord ( <a ref='Revelation 11:15'>11:15</a> ), indicating that the time the disciples anticipated has come ( <a ref='Matthew 24:3'>Mt 24:3</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:6'>Ac 1:6</a> ). The prayers of the saints will be answered ( <a ref='Revelation 6:9–11'>6:9–11</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 6:10'>Mt 6:10</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 10:7'>10:7</a> <b>the mystery.</b> A Greek term meaning “to shut” or “to close.” In the NT, a “mystery” is a truth that God concealed but has revealed through Christ and His apostles ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Ephesians 3:4–5'>Eph 3:4–5</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 16:25'>Ro 16:25</a> ). Here the mystery is the final consummation of all things as God destroys sinners and establishes His righteous kingdom on earth. <b>as He proclaimed.</b> This mystery, though not fully revealed, was declared to God’s prophets (cf. <a ref='Amos 3:7'>Am 3:7</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 10:9'>10:9</a> <b>Take it and eat it.</b> This act graphically illustrates taking in God’s Word. John’s physical reactions demonstrate what every believer’s proper response to God’s judgment should be (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 3:1'>Eze 3:1</a> )—sweet anticipation of God’s glory and our victory, and at the same time, the bitterness of seeing God’s wrath poured out on those who reject His Son. <b>your stomach bitter.</b> As he truly digests what the seal, trumpet, and bowl judgments hold in store for the sinner, John becomes nauseated. <b>in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.</b> But still God’s final victory and vindication are sweet realities to the believer. <a ref='Revelation 10:11'>10:11</a> <b>prophesy again.</b> A call for John to warn men about the bitter judgment in the seventh trumpet and the 7 bowls. <b>peoples and nations and tongues and kings.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 7:9'>7:9</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 11:1'>11:1</a> <b>a measuring rod.</b> This was a hollow, bamboo-like cane plant that grew in the Jordan Valley. Because of its light weight and rigidity, it was commonly used as a measuring rod (cf. <a ref='Ezekiel 40:3'>Eze 40:3</a> , <a ref='Ezekiel 40:5'>5</a> ). Measuring the temple signified God’s ownership of it (cf. <a ref='Revelation 21:15'>21:15</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 2:1–5'>Zec 2:1–5</a> ). <b>the sanctuary of God.</b> Refers to the Holy of Holies and the Holy Place, not the entire temple complex (cf. v. <a ref='Revelation 11:2'>2</a> ). A rebuilt temple will exist during the time of the Tribulation ( <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>Da 9:27</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 12:11'>12:11</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:15'>Mt 24:15</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:4'>2Th 2:4</a> ). <b>altar.</b> The reference to worshipers suggests this is the bronze altar in the courtyard, not the incense altar in the Holy Place, since only the priests were permitted inside the Holy Place (cf. <a ref='Luke 1:8–10'>Lk 1:8–10</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 11:2'>11:2</a> <b>court which is outside.</b> The court of the Gentiles, separated from the inner court in the Herodian temple by a low wall. Gentiles were forbidden to enter the inner court on penalty of death. That John is instructed not to measure the outer court symbolizes God’s rejection of the unbelieving Gentiles who have oppressed His covenant people. <b>trample the holy city under foot.</b> Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome all oppressed Jerusalem in ancient times (cf. <a ref='2 Kings 25:8–10'>2Ki 25:8–10</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 79:1'>Ps 79:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 63:18'>Is 63:18</a> ; <a ref='Lamentations 1:10'>Lam 1:10</a> ). This verse refers to the future devastating destruction and oppression of Jerusalem by the forces of the Antichrist. <b>forty-two months.</b> This 3 1/2 -year period covers the second half of the Tribulation and coincides with the visibly evil career of the Antichrist (v. <a ref='Revelation 11:3'>3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:6'>12:6</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:5'>13:5</a> ). During this same time, the Jews will be sheltered by God in the wilderness ( <a ref='Revelation 12:6'>12:6</a> , <a ref='Revelation 12:14'>14</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 11:3'>11:3</a> <b>two witnesses.</b> Individuals granted special power and authority by God to preach a message of judgment and salvation during the second half of the Tribulation. The OT required two or more witnesses to confirm testimony (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 17:6'>Dt 17:6</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 19:15'>19:15</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 18:16'>Mt 18:16</a> ; <a ref='John 8:17'>Jn 8:17</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:28'>Heb 10:28</a> ), and these two prophets will be the culmination of God’s testimony to Israel: a message of judgment from God and of His gracious offer of the gospel to all who will repent and believe. <b>1,260 days.</b> Forty-two months or 3 1/2 years (cf. <a ref='Revelation 12:6'>12:6</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:5'>13:5</a> ; <i>see note on v. <a ref='Revelation 11:2'>2</a></i> ). <b>sackcloth.</b> Coarse, rough cloth made from goat or camel hair. Wearing garments made from it expressed penitence, humility, and mourning (cf. <a ref='Genesis 37:34'>Ge 37:34</a> ; <a ref='2 Samuel 3:31'>2Sa 3:31</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 6:30'>2Ki 6:30</a> ; <a ref='2 Kings 19:1'>19:1</a> ; <a ref='Es 4:1'>Es 4:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 22:12'>Is 22:12</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 6:26'>Jer 6:26</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 11:21'>Mt 11:21</a> ). The witnesses are mourning because of the wretched wickedness of the world, God’s judgment on it, and the desecration of the temple and the holy city by the Antichrist. <a ref='Revelation 11:4'>11:4</a> This imagery is drawn from <a ref='Zec 3-4'>Zec 3–4</a> ( <i>see notes there</i> ). Zechariah’s vision had both a near fulfillment (the rebuilding of the temple by Joshua and Zerubbabel) and a far future fulfillment (the two witnesses, whose ministry points toward Israel’s final restoration in the Millennium). <b>two olive trees and the two lampstands.</b> Olive oil was commonly used in lamps; together the olive trees and lampstands symbolize the light of spiritual revival. The two witnesses’ preaching will spark a revival, just as Joshua’s and Zerubbabel’s did in Israel after the Babylonian captivity. <a ref='Revelation 11:5–6'>11:5–6</a> While it is impossible to be dogmatic about the identity of these two witnesses, several observations suggest they might be Moses and Elijah: 1) like Moses, they strike the earth with plagues, and like Elijah, they have the power to keep it from raining; 2) Jewish tradition expected both Moses (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 18:15–18'>Dt 18:15–18</a> ) and Elijah (cf. <a ref='Malachi 4:5–6'>Mal 4:5–6</a> ) to return in the future (cf. <a ref='John 1:21'>Jn 1:21</a> ); 3) both Moses and Elijah were present at the Transfiguration, the preview of Christ’s second coming; 4) both Moses and Elijah used supernatural means to provoke repentance; 5) Elijah was taken up alive into heaven, and God buried Moses’ body where it would never be found; and 6) the length of the drought the two witnesses bring (3 1/2 years; cf. v. 3) is the same as that brought by Elijah ( <a ref='James 5:17'>Jas 5:17</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 11:5'>11:5</a> <b>fire comes out … and devours.</b> Probably this refers to literal fire. These two will be invincible during their ministry, protected by supernatural power. The false prophet will counterfeit this sign ( <a ref='Revelation 13:3'>13:3</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 11:6'>11:6</a> <b>authority to shut up the sky.</b> Miracles have often authenticated God’s messengers. Here, bringing a 3 1/2 -year drought (as did Elijah before them) will add immeasurable torment to those experiencing the worldwide disasters of the Tribulation—and exacerbate their hatred of the two witnesses. <b>waters to turn them into blood.</b> The earth’s water, already devastated by the effects of the second and third trumpets, will become undrinkable, adding immensely to the suffering caused by the drought. <a ref='Revelation 11:7'>11:7</a> <b>the beast.</b> The first of 36 references to this person in Revelation, who is none other than the Antichrist (see chap. <a ref='Rev 13'>13</a> ). That he will ascend out of the bottomless pit indicates that his power is satanic. <b>kill them.</b> Their ministry completed, God will withdraw the two witnesses’ supernatural protection. The beast will then be able to accomplish what many had died trying to do. <a ref='Revelation 11:8'>11:8</a> <b>bodies</b> will lie <b>in the street.</b> Refusing to bury one’s enemies was a way to dishonor and show contempt for them (cf. <a ref='Acts 14:19'>Ac 14:19</a> ). The OT expressly forbids this practice ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 21:22–23'>Dt 21:22–23</a> ). <b>the great city.</b> Identifying Jerusalem as a city like Sodom and Egypt stresses the city’s wickedness. Its Jewish population will apparently be the focus of the witnesses’ ministry, leading to the conversions of v. <a ref='Revelation 11:13'>13</a> . <a ref='Revelation 11:9'>11:9</a> <b>three and a half days.</b> The entire world will watch (undoubtedly on the latest form of visual media) and glorify the Antichrist as the bodies of the dead prophets who have been killed begin to decay. <a ref='Revelation 11:10'>11:10</a> <b>rejoice … celebrate … send gifts.</b> Wild with joy over the death of their tormentors, those who dwell on the earth (a phrase used 11 times in Revelation to speak of unbelievers) will celebrate the two witnesses’ deaths as a holiday. <a ref='Revelation 11:11'>11:11</a> <b>breath of life from God came into them.</b> The festivities, however, are short-lived as God vindicates His faithful witnesses by resurrecting them. <a ref='Revelation 11:12'>11:12</a> <b>went up into heaven in the cloud.</b> Some may wonder why God will not allow them to preach, assuming their message would have more force following their resurrection. But that ignores Christ’s clear statement to the contrary ( <a ref='Luke 16:31'>Lk 16:31</a> ). <b>enemies watched them.</b> Those who hated and dishonored the two witnesses will watch their vindication. <a ref='Revelation 11:13'>11:13</a> <b>earthquake.</b> God punctuates the ascension of His prophets with a shattering earthquake. The destruction and loss of life may be primarily among the leaders of the Antichrist’s forces. <b>the rest.</b> This refers to the Jews still living, who will not yet have come to faith in Christ. <b>gave glory to the God of heaven.</b> A genuine experience of the salvation of Jews (cf. <a ref='Luke 17:18–19'>Lk 17:18–19</a> ), in contrast to those who blaspheme and refuse to glorify God ( <a ref='Revelation 16:9'>16:9</a> ). This makes a key fulfilment of Zechariah’s prophecy ( <a ref='Revelation 12:10'>12:10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:1'>13:1</a> ) and Paul’s ( <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>Ro 11:25–27</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 11:14'>11:14</a> <b>second woe.</b> The sixth trumpet ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 9:12'>9:12</a></i> ). The interlude between the sixth and seventh trumpets ends ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 10:1'>10:1</a></i> ). Israel’s repentance will shortly usher in the millennial kingdom ( <a ref='Acts 3:19–21'>Ac 3:19–21</a> ; <a ref='Romans 11:25–26'>Ro 11:25–26</a> ). But first will come the final, climactic judgments. <a ref='Revelation 11:15'>11:15</a> <b>seventh angel sounded.</b> The seventh trumpet includes the 7 bowl, final judgments depicted in chap. <a ref='Rev 16'>16</a> and all the events leading up to the establishing of the millennial kingdom (chap. <a ref='Rev 20'>20</a> ) and the coronation of Jesus as King (chap. <a ref='Rev 19'>19</a> ). kingdom <b>of our Lord and of His Christ.</b> Despite its many political and cultural divisions, the Bible views the world spiritually as one kingdom, with one ruler—Satan ( <a ref='John 12:31'>Jn 12:31</a> ; <a ref='John 14:30'>14:30</a> ; <a ref='John 16:11'>16:11</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 4:4'>2Co 4:4</a> ). Following Satan’s lead, the human rulers of this world are generally hostile to Christ ( <a ref='Psalms 2:2'>Ps 2:2</a> ; <a ref='Acts 4:26'>Ac 4:26</a> ). The long rebellion of the world kingdom will end with the victorious return of the Lord Jesus Christ to defeat His enemies and establish His messianic kingdom ( <a ref='Isaiah 2:2–3'>Is 2:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 2:44'>Da 2:44</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 7:13–14'>7:13–14</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:18'>18</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:22'>22</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:27'>27</a> ; <a ref='Luke 1:31–33'>Lk 1:31–33</a> ). This kingdom also belongs to God the Father ( <i>see notes on <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:24'>1Co 15:24</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 11:16'>11:16</a> <b>twenty-four elders.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 4:4'>4:4</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 11:17'>11:17</a> <b>the Almighty, who is and who was.</b> The coming of the kingdom is no longer future, it will be immediate. <a ref='Revelation 11:18'>11:18</a> <b>nations were enraged.</b> No longer terrified (cf. <a ref='Revelation 6:15–17'>6:15–17</a> ), they will be filled with defiant rage. Their hostility will shortly manifest itself in a foolish attempt to fight against Christ—a doomed, futile effort that is the apex of human rebellion against God ( <a ref='Revelation 16:14'>16:14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:17–21'>19:17–21</a> ). <b>Your rage.</b> Almighty God answers the feeble, impotent fury of the nations (cf. <a ref='Psalms 2:1–9'>Ps 2:1–9</a> ). The 24 elders speak of God’s future wrath ( <a ref='Revelation 20:11–15'>20:11–15</a> ) as if it were already present, signifying its certainty. That God will one day pour out His wrath on rebellious men is a major theme in Scripture (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 24:17–23'>Is 24:17–23</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 26:20–21'>26:20–21</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 30:27–33'>30:27–33</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 38:16'>Eze 38:16ff.</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:5–10'>2Th 1:5–10</a> ). <b>dead … judged.</b> The final outpouring of God’s wrath includes judging the dead (cf. <a ref='Matthew 25:31–46'>Mt 25:31–46</a> ; <a ref='John 5:25–29'>Jn 5:25–29</a> ). The judgment has two parts: 1) God rewards OT saints ( <a ref='Daniel 12:1–3'>Da 12:1–3</a> ; cf. <a ref='Revelation 22:12'>22:12</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:8'>1Co 3:8</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 4:5'>4:5</a> ), the raptured church ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:51–52'>1Co 15:51–52</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:13–18'>1Th 4:13–18</a> ), and Tribulation saints ( <a ref='Revelation 20:4'>20:4</a> ); and 2) God condemns unbelievers to the lake of fire forever ( <a ref='Revelation 20:15'>20:15</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 11:19'>11:19</a> <b>sanctuary of God … heaven.</b> See <a ref='Revelation 3:12'>3:12</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 7:15'>7:15</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:15–17'>14:15–17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 15:5–8'>15:5–8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:1'>16:1</a> , <a ref='Revelation 16:17'>17</a> . The heavenly Holy of Holies ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Exodus 26:31–36'>Ex 26:31–36</a></i> ), where God dwells in transcendent glory, already is identified as His throne (chaps. <a ref='Rev 4-5'>4–5</a> ). Cf. <a ref='Hebrews 9:24'>Heb 9:24</a> . John had seen the throne ( <a ref='Revelation 4:5'>4:5</a> ), the altar ( <a ref='Revelation 6:9'>6:9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 8:3–5'>8:3–5</a> ), and here the Holy of Holies. <b>ark of His covenant.</b> This piece of furniture in the OT tabernacle and temple ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Exodus 25:11–18'>Ex 25:11–18</a></i> ) symbolized God’s presence, atonement, and covenant with His people. That earthly ark was only a picture of this heavenly one (see <a ref='Hebrews 9:23'>Heb 9:23</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:20'>10:20</a> ). It was there God provided mercy and atonement for sin. As the earthly Holy of Holies was open when the price of sin was paid ( <a ref='Matthew 27:51'>Mt 27:51</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:19–20'>Heb 10:19–20</a> ), so the Holy of Holies in heaven is opened to speak of God’s saving New Covenant and redeeming purpose in the midst of judgment. <b>lightning … thunder … earthquake … hailstorm.</b> What was anticipated in <a ref='Revelation 4:5'>4:5</a> and <a ref='Revelation 8:5'>8:5</a> will become a terrifying reality. These events occur as part of the seventh bowl ( <a ref='Revelation 16:17–21'>16:17–21</a> ) and are the climax of the seventh trumpet. Since heaven is the source of vengeance, judgment also comes out of God’s Holy of Holies ( <a ref='Revelation 14:15'>14:15</a> , <a ref='Revelation 14:17'>17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 15:5–8'>15:5–8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:1'>16:1</a> , <a ref='Revelation 16:7'>7</a> , <a ref='Revelation 16:17'>17</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 6:1'>6:1</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 12:1'>12:1</a> <b>sign.</b> A symbol pointing to something else. This is the first of 7 signs in the last half of Revelation. Cf. v. <a ref='Revelation 12:3'>3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:13–14'>13:13–14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 15:1'>15:1</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:14'>16:14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:20'>19:20</a> . <b>a woman.</b> Not an actual woman, but a symbolic representation of Israel, pictured in the OT as the wife of God ( <a ref='Isaiah 54:5–6'>Is 54:5–6</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 3:6–8'>Jer 3:6–8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 31:32'>31:32</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 16:32'>Eze 16:32</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 2:16'>Hos 2:16</a> ). Three other symbolic women appear in Revelation: 1) Jezebel, who represents paganism ( <a ref='Revelation 2:20'>2:20</a> ); 2) the scarlet woman ( <a ref='Revelation 17:3–6'>17:3–6</a> ), symbolizing the apostate church; and 3) the wife of the Lamb ( <a ref='Revelation 19:7'>19:7</a> ), symbolizing the true church. That this woman does not represent the church is clear from the context. <b>clothed with the sun … moon under her feet … twelve stars.</b> Cf. <a ref='Genesis 37:9–11'>Ge 37:9–11</a> . Being clothed with the sun speaks of the glory, dignity, and exalted status of Israel, the people of promise who will be saved and given a kingdom. The picture of the moon under her feet possibly describes God’s covenant relationship with Israel, since new moons were associated with worship ( <a ref='1 Chronicles 23:31'>1Chr 23:31</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 2:4'>2Chr 2:4</a> ; <a ref='2 Chronicles 8:13'>8:13</a> ; <a ref='Ezra 3:5'>Ezr 3:5</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 81:3'>Ps 81:3</a> ). The 12 stars represent the 12 tribes of Israel. <a ref='Revelation 12:2'>12:2</a> <b>cried out … in pain.</b> Israel, often pictured as a mother giving birth (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 26:17–18'>Is 26:17–18</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 54:1'>54:1</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 66:7–12'>66:7–12</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 13:13'>Hos 13:13</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:10'>Mic 4:10</a> ; <a ref='Micah 5:2–3'>5:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:8'>Mt 24:8</a> ), had agonized and suffered for centuries, longing for the Messiah to come and destroy Satan, sin, and death, and usher in the kingdom. <a ref='Revelation 12:3'>12:3</a> <b>great red dragon.</b> The woman’s mortal enemy is Satan, who appears as a dragon 13 times in this book (cf. v. <a ref='Revelation 12:9'>9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:2'>20:2</a> ). Red speaks of bloodshed (cf. <a ref='John 8:44'>Jn 8:44</a> ). <b>seven heads … ten horns … seven diadems.</b> Figurative language depicting Satan’s domination of 7 past worldly kingdoms and 10 future kingdoms (cf. <a ref='Daniel 7:7'>Da 7:7</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:20'>20</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:24'>24</a> ). <i>See notes on <a ref='Revelation 13:1'>13:1</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 17:9–10'>17:9–10</a> .</i> Satan has and will rule the world until the seventh trumpet blows ( <a ref='Revelation 11:15'>11:15</a> ). He has inflicted relentless pain on Israel ( <a ref='Daniel 8:24'>Da 8:24</a> ), desiring to kill the woman before she could bring forth the child that would destroy him ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Es 3:6–15'>Es 3:6–15</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 12:4'>12:4</a> <b>a third of the stars of heaven.</b> Satan’s original rebellion (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 14:12'>Is 14:12ff.</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 28:11'>Eze 28:11ff.</a> ) resulted in one-third of the angelic host joining his insurrection and becoming demons. <b>devour her child.</b> Unable to prevent the virgin birth of Christ, Satan tried to kill the child in a general massacre of male children commanded by Herod ( <a ref='Matthew 2:13–18'>Mt 2:13–18</a> ; cf. <a ref='Luke 4:28–29'>Lk 4:28–29</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 12:5'>12:5</a> <b>a male</b> child <b>.</b> Jesus Christ in His incarnation was of Jewish descent ( <a ref='Matthew 1:1'>Mt 1:1</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 2:8'>2Ti 2:8</a> ). Despite Satan’s efforts to destroy Israel and the messianic line, Jesus’ birth took place as predicted by the prophets (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 7:14'>Is 7:14</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 9:6'>9:6</a> ; <a ref='Micah 5:2'>Mic 5:2</a> ). <b>rod of iron.</b> Describes Jesus’ coronation as King over the nations of the world (cf. <a ref='Revelation 11:15'>11:15</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:15'>19:15</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 2:6–9'>Ps 2:6–9</a> ). <b>her child was caught up to God.</b> Christ’s ascension is in view ( <a ref='Acts 1:9'>Ac 1:9</a> ; <a ref='Acts 2:33'>2:33</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 1:1–3'>Heb 1:1–3</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 12:2'>12:2</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 12:6'>12:6</a> <b>wilderness.</b> God will protect Israel from Satan by hiding her in the wilderness, perhaps in the region of Moab, Ammon, and Edom, east of Israel. Interestingly, those countries will be specifically spared from the Antichrist’s attack against the Holy Land (cf. <a ref='Daniel 11:41'>Da 11:41</a> ). <b>1,260 days.</b> At the midpoint of the Tribulation, the Antichrist breaks his covenant with Israel, puts a stop to temple worship, sets up the abomination of desolation ( <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>Da 9:27</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:15'>Mt 24:15</a> ), and devastates Jerusalem ( <a ref='Revelation 11:2'>11:2</a> ). At that time, many Jews flee for their lives ( <a ref='Matthew 24:16'>Mt 24:16ff.</a> ). God will preserve them during the last 1,260 days (42 months; 3 1/2 years) constituting the Great Tribulation. <i>See notes on <a ref='Revelation 3:10'>3:10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 6:1'>6:1</a> , <a ref='Revelation 6:9'>9</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 12:7'>12:7</a> <b>war in heaven.</b> The tumultuous events on earth during the Tribulation find their counterpart in heaven. A state of war has existed since the fall of Satan (cf. v. <a ref='Revelation 12:4'>4</a> ; cf. <a ref='Daniel 10:13'>Da 10:13</a> ; <a ref='Jude 1:9'>Jd 9</a> ). Something will intensify that warfare—possibly the raptured saints passing through the realm of the prince of the power of the air (cf. <a ref='Ephesians 2:2'>Eph 2:2</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 12:9'>12:9</a> <b>dragon was thrown down … to the earth.</b> Satan and his demons were cast out of heaven at the time of their original rebellion, but still have access to it (cf. <a ref='Job 1:6'>Job 1:6</a> ; <a ref='Job 2:1'>2:1</a> ). That access will then be denied, and they will be forever barred from heaven. <b>devil and Satan.</b> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 20:2'>20:2</a> . “Devil” comes from a Greek verb meaning “to slander” or “to falsely accuse.” He is a malignant liar ( <a ref='John 8:44'>Jn 8:44</a> ; <a ref='1 John 3:8'>1Jn 3:8</a> ). His accusations against believers (v. <a ref='Revelation 12:10'>10</a> ) are unsuccessful because of Christ our Advocate ( <a ref='1 John 2:1'>1Jn 2:1</a> ). Satan, meaning “adversary,” or “enemy,” appears especially in Job and the Gospels. <b>deceives the whole world.</b> As he has throughout human history, Satan will deceive people during the Tribulation (cf. <a ref='Revelation 13:14'>13:14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:3'>20:3</a> ; <a ref='John 8:44'>Jn 8:44</a> ). After his temporary release from the bottomless pit at the end of the Millennium, he will briefly resume his deceitful ways ( <a ref='Revelation 20:8'>20:8</a> , <a ref='Revelation 20:10'>10</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 12:10'>12:10</a> <b>accuser.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Revelation 12:9'>9</a> .</i> Satan will no longer accuse believers before the throne of God because he will no longer have access to heaven. <a ref='Revelation 12:11'>12:11</a> <b>blood of the Lamb.</b> No accusation can stand against those whose sins have been forgiven because of Christ’s sacrificial death (see <a ref='Romans 8:33–39'>Ro 8:33–39</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 12:12'>12:12</a> <b>he has</b> only <b>a short time.</b> Knowing that his time is limited, Satan will intensify his efforts against God and mankind, and specifically target Israel (v. <a ref='Revelation 12:13'>13</a> , <a ref='Revelation 12:17'>17</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 12:14'>12:14</a> <b>wings of the great eagle.</b> Not actual birds’ wings, but a graphic depiction of God’s providential protection of Israel (cf. <a ref='Exodus 19:4'>Ex 19:4</a> ). Wings often speak of protection (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:9–12'>Dt 32:9–12</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 91:4'>Ps 91:4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 40:31'>Is 40:31</a> ). Eagles—probably vulture-like griffins—were the largest birds known in Palestine. <b>a time and times and half a time.</b> Three and one-half years; the second half of the Tribulation (cf. v. <a ref='Revelation 12:6'>6</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:2–3'>11:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:5'>13:5</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 12:16'>12:16</a> <b>earth opened its mouth.</b> A great army will come against Israel like a flood (v. <a ref='Revelation 12:15'>15</a> ; cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 46:8'>Jer 46:8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 47:2'>47:2</a> ), only to be swallowed up, perhaps in conjunction with one of the numerous earthquakes that occur during that period ( <a ref='Revelation 6:12'>6:12</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 8:5'>8:5</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:13'>11:13</a> , <a ref='Revelation 11:19'>19</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:18'>16:18</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:7'>Mt 24:7</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 12:17'>12:17</a> <b>rest of her seed.</b> Satan will turn his frustrated rage against every follower of the Lamb he can find—Jew or Gentile. <b>commandments of God … witness of Jesus.</b> The revealed truth from God and Christ contained in Scripture. Obedience to God’s Word always marks a genuine believer. Cf. <a ref='John 8:32'>Jn 8:32</a> . <a ref='Revelation 13:1'>13:1</a> <b>the dragon stood.</b> Satan takes a position in the midst of the nations of his world, represented by the sand of the sea. <b>a beast.</b> Lit. “a monster” (cf. <a ref='Revelation 11:7'>11:7</a> ), which describes a vicious, killing animal. In this context, the term represents both a person (Antichrist) and his system (the world). The final satanic world empire will be inseparable from the demon-possessed man who leads it. For a discussion of Antichrist, <i>see notes on <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:3–11'>2Th 2:3–11</a></i> . He is also described in <a ref='Daniel 7:8'>Da 7:8</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:21–26'>21–26</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 8:23–25'>8:23–25</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 9:24–27'>9:24–27</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 11:36–45'>11:36–45</a> . <b>coming up out of the sea.</b> The sea represents the abyss or pit, the haunt of demons (cf. <a ref='Revelation 11:7'>11:7</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 17:8'>17:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:1'>20:1</a> ; <a ref='Luke 8:31'>Lk 8:31</a> ). The picture is of Satan summoning a powerful demon from the abyss, who then activates and controls the beast (Antichrist) and his empire. <b>ten horns and seven heads.</b> This description is like that of Satan in <a ref='Revelation 12:3'>12:3</a> . The heads may represent successive world empires—Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and the final kingdom of Antichrist ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Revelation 17:9–10'>17:9–10</a></i> ). The final one is made up of all the kingdoms represented by the horns ( <i>see notes for <a ref='Revelation 17:12'>17:12</a></i> ). Ten is a number that symbolizes the totality of human military and political power assisting the beast (Antichrist) as he controls the world. Horns always represent power, as in the animal kingdom—both offensive power (attack) and defensive power (protection). Daniel shows that the human Antichrist will rise up from these 10 kings ( <a ref='Daniel 7:16–24'>Da 7:16–24</a> ). John picks up the numerical imagery of <a ref='Daniel 2:41–42'>Da 2:41–42</a> , which refers to the 10 toes on the statue’s clay and iron feet. The apostle sees the beast as the final world government—the anti-Christ, anti-God coalition—headed by a revived Roman Empire, having the strengths of various world powers, yet mixed with weakness and ultimately crushed (cf. <a ref='Daniel 2:32–45'>Da 2:32–45</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 7:7–8'>7:7–8</a> , <a ref='Daniel 7:19–25'>19–25</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 12:3'>12:3</a></i> ). The crowns show the regal dominion of this confederate kingdom. <b>blasphemous names.</b> Throughout history, every time a monarch has identified himself as a god, he has blasphemed the true God. Each ruler who contributes to the beast’s final coalition has an identity, wears a crown, exerts dominion and power, and therefore blasphemes God. <a ref='Revelation 13:2'>13:2</a> <b>leopard.</b> A metaphor for ancient Greece, alluding to the Greeks’ swiftness and agility as their military moved forward in conquest, particularly under Alexander the Great (cf. <a ref='Daniel 7:6'>Da 7:6</a> ). The leopard and subsequent animal symbols were all native wildlife in Syria and Israel, familiar to John’s readers. <b>bear.</b> A metaphor for the ancient Medo-Persian Empire, depicting that kingdom’s ferocious strength, combined with its great stability (cf. <a ref='Daniel 7:5'>Da 7:5</a> ). <b>lion.</b> A metaphor for the ancient Babylonian Empire, referring to the Babylonians’ fierce, all-consuming power as they extended their domain (cf. <a ref='Daniel 7:4'>Da 7:4</a> ). <b>the dragon gave him his power.</b> <i>See notes on v. <a ref='Revelation 13:1'>1</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:9'>12:9</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 13:3'>13:3</a> <b>his fatal wound was healed.</b> This statement could refer to one of the kingdoms that was destroyed and revived (i.e., the Roman Empire). But more likely it refers to a fake death and resurrection enacted by the Antichrist, as part of his lying deception. Cf. vv. <a ref='Revelation 13:12'>12</a> , <a ref='Revelation 13:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 17:8'>17:8</a> , <a ref='Revelation 17:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:9'>2Th 2:9</a> . <b>earth marveled.</b> People in the world will be astounded and fascinated when Antichrist appears to rise from the dead.

God will allow him to utter his blasphemies, to bring the rage of Satan to its culmination on earth for 3 1/2 years (v. <a ref='Revelation 13:5'>5</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:2–3'>11:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:6'>12:6</a> , <a ref='Revelation 12:13–14'>13–14</a> ). <b>forty-two months.</b> The final 3 1/2 years—1,260 days—of the “time of Jacob’s distress” ( <a ref='Jeremiah 30:7'>Jer 30:7</a> ) and Daniel’s 70th week ( <a ref='Daniel 9:24–27'>Da 9:24–27</a> ), known as the Great Tribulation ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Revelation 11:2'>11:2</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:6'>12:6</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Daniel 7:25'>Da 7:25</a> ).

Antichrist can never take away the salvation of the elect. The eternal registry of the elect will never be altered, nor will the saved in the Antichrist’s day worship him. <b>book of life.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 3:5'>3:5</a> .</i> <b>Lamb … slain.</b> The Lord Jesus who died to purchase the salvation of those whom God had chosen was fulfilling an eternal plan. <a ref='Revelation 13:9'>13:9</a> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 2:7'>2:7</a> , <a ref='Revelation 2:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Revelation 2:17'>17</a> , <a ref='Revelation 2:29'>29</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 3:6'>3:6</a> , <a ref='Revelation 3:13'>13</a> , <a ref='Revelation 3:22'>22</a> . This phrase omits “what the Spirit says to the churches” as in the 7 letters to the churches, perhaps because they have been raptured. <a ref='Revelation 13:10'>13:10</a> A call for believers to accept persecution from Antichrist with perseverance and endurance. God has chosen some believers to be imprisoned and executed which they must not resist (cf. <a ref='Matthew 26:51–54'>Mt 26:51–54</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 10:4'>2Co 10:4</a> ), but accept with patience such suffering as God ordains for them (cf. <a ref='1 Peter 2:19–24'>1Pe 2:19–24</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 13:11'>13:11</a> <b>another beast.</b> This is the final false prophet (called such in <a ref='Revelation 16:13'>16:13</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:20'>19:20</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:10'>20:10</a> ) who promotes Antichrist’s power and convinces the world to worship him as God. This companion beast will be the chief, most persuasive proponent of satanic religion (cf. <a ref='Revelation 16:13'>16:13</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:20'>19:20</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:10'>20:10</a> ). Antichrist will be primarily a political and military leader, but the false prophet will be a religious leader. Politics and religion will unite in a worldwide religion of worshiping the Antichrist (see <a ref='Revelation 17:1–9'>17:1–9</a> , <a ref='Revelation 17:15–17'>15–17</a> ). <b>out of the earth.</b> Likely another reference to the abyss that lies below the earth. The false prophet will be sent forth and controlled by a powerful demon from below. The earth imagery, in contrast to that of the foreboding, mysterious sea in v. <a ref='Revelation 13:1'>1</a> , may imply that the false prophet is subtler and more winsome than Antichrist. <b>two horns like a lamb.</b> This describes the relative weakness of the false prophet compared to Antichrist, who has 10 horns. A lamb has only two small bumps on its head, very inferior to the 10-horned beast. <b>like a lamb.</b> The lamb imagery may also imply that the false prophet will be also a false Christ masquerading as the true Lamb. Unlike Antichrist, the false prophet will come not as a killing, destroying animal, but as one who appears gentle and deceptively attractive. <b>was speaking as a dragon.</b> The false prophet will be Satan’s mouthpiece, and thus his message will be like the dragon, Satan—the source of all false religion (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 11:14'>2Co 11:14</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 13:12'>13:12</a> <b>exercises all the authority of the first beast.</b> The false prophet exercises the same kind of satanic power as Antichrist because he is empowered by the same source. He, too, will have worldwide influence and a reputation as a miracle worker and speaker. <b>makes the earth … to worship.</b> The phrase “he makes” or “he causes” is used several times of him. He wields influence to establish a false world religion headed by Antichrist and to entice people to accept that system. <b>whose fatal wound was healed.</b> <i>See notes on v. <a ref='Revelation 13:3'>3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 17:8'>17:8</a> .</i> This likely refers to the carefully crafted deception of a false resurrection, a false murder to inspire allegiance for the world. <a ref='Revelation 13:13'>13:13</a> <b>great signs.</b> The same phrase is used of Jesus’ miracles ( <a ref='John 2:11'>Jn 2:11</a> , <a ref='John 2:23'>23</a> ; <a ref='John 6:2'>6:2</a> ), which indicates the false prophet performs signs that counterfeit Christ’s. Satan, who has done supernatural works in the past (e.g., <a ref='Exodus 7:11'>Ex 7:11</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 3:8'>2Ti 3:8</a> ), must use his strategy of false miracles to convince the world that Antichrist is more powerful than God’s true witnesses (chap. <a ref='Rev 11'>11</a> ), including Jesus Christ. <b>fire come down out of heaven.</b> The context indicates that the false prophet does counterfeit pyrotechnic signs continually to convince men of his power, and also in imitation of the two witnesses ( <a ref='Revelation 11:5'>11:5</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 13:14'>13:14</a> <b>make an image.</b> This refers to replication of Antichrist that is related to the throne he will erect during the abomination of desolation, halfway into the Tribulation period. This will happen in the Jerusalem temple when Antichrist abolishes the former false world religion and seeks to have people worship him alone as God (cf. <a ref='Daniel 9:27'>Da 9:27</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 11:31'>11:31</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 12:11'>12:11</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:15'>Mt 24:15</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:4'>2Th 2:4</a> ). The false prophet and Antichrist again will deceive the world with a clever imitation of Christ, who will later return and reign from the true throne in Jerusalem. <a ref='Revelation 13:15'>13:15</a> <b>speak.</b> The false prophet will give the image of Antichrist the appearance of life, and the image will seem to utter words—contrary to what is normally true of idols (cf. <a ref='Psalms 135:15–16'>Ps 135:15–16</a> ; <a ref='Habakkuk 2:19'>Hab 2:19</a> ). <b>cause … to be killed.</b> His gentleness is a lie, since he is a killer ( <a ref='Revelation 7:9–17'>7:9–17</a> ). Some Gentiles will be spared to populate the kingdom ( <a ref='Matthew 25:31–40'>Mt 25:31–40</a> ), and Jews will be protected ( <a ref='Revelation 12:17'>12:17</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 13:16'>13:16</a> <b>a mark.</b> In the Roman Empire, this was a normal identifying symbol, or brand, that slaves and soldiers bore on their bodies. Some of the ancient mystical cults delighted in such tattoos, which identified members with a form of worship. Antichrist will have a similar requirement, one that will need to be visible on the hand or forehead. <a ref='Revelation 13:17'>13:17</a> <b>to buy or to sell.</b> Antichrist’s mark will allow people to engage in daily commerce, including the purchase of food and other necessities. Without the identifying mark, individuals will be cut off from the necessities of life. <b>number of his name.</b> The beast (Antichrist) will have a name inherent in a numbering system. It is not clear from the text exactly what this name and number system will be or what its significance will be. <a ref='Revelation 13:18'>13:18</a> <b>his number is 666.</b> This is the essential number of a man. The number 6 falls one short of God’s perfect number, 7, and thus represents human imperfection. Antichrist, the most powerful human the world will ever know, will still be a man, i.e., a 6. The ultimate in human and demonic power is a 6, not perfect, as God is. The 3-fold repetition of the number is intended to reiterate and underscore man’s identity. When Antichrist is finally revealed, there will be some way to identify him with this basic number of a man, or his name may have the numerical equivalent of 666. (In many languages, including Hebrew, Greek, and Lat., letters have numerical equivalents.) Because this text reveals very little about the meaning of 666, it is unwise to speculate beyond what is said. <a ref='Revelation 14:1'>14:1</a> <b>the Lamb.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 5:6'>5:6</a> .</i> <b>Mount Zion.</b> The city of Jerusalem, where Messiah will return and plant His feet (cf. <a ref='Ps 2'>Pss 2</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 48:1–2'>48:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 24:23'>Is 24:23</a> ). <b>144,000.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 7:4'>7:4</a> .</i> <b>name.</b> The counterpart to the mark of the beast. It is the stamp that will identify the 144,000 as belonging to God ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 13:6'>13:6</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 14:2'>14:2</a> <b>harps.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 5:8'>5:8</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 14:3'>14:3</a> <b>new song.</b> The song of redemption, which is being sung by all the redeemed saints in one gigantic choir.

This phrase indicates that the 144,000 Jewish evangelists will have not only resisted the perverse system of Antichrist, but they will have also resisted all temptations to illicit sex. Cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 11:2'>2Co 11:2</a> . <b>follow the Lamb.</b> This indicates partisanship for Jesus Christ. The victorious 144,000 are unwaveringly loyal to Him, whatever the cost (cf. <a ref='Matthew 16:24'>Mt 16:24</a> ; <a ref='Mark 10:21'>Mk 10:21</a> ; <a ref='Luke 9:23'>Lk 9:23</a> ; <a ref='John 10:27'>Jn 10:27</a> ; <a ref='John 12:26'>12:26</a> ; <a ref='John 14:15'>14:15</a> ). <b>first fruits.</b> Like the OT first fruits offerings, these men will be set apart for special service to God (cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 26:1–11'>Dt 26:1–11</a> ). Some see first fruits as the first large group of redeemed Israel ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 11:13'>11:13</a></i> ), saved much earlier, and representative of more converts to follow (cf. <a ref='Romans 16:5'>Ro 16:5</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 16:15'>1Co 16:15</a> ), the first fruits of a redeemed Israel ( <a ref='Romans 11:1–5'>Ro 11:1–5</a> , <a ref='Romans 11:11–15'>11–15</a> , <a ref='Romans 11:25–27'>25–27</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 14:5'>14:5</a> no lie <b>.</b> The 144,000 speak God’s truth accurately and precisely, with no exaggeration or understatement (cf. <a ref='Zephaniah 3:13'>Zep 3:13</a> ). <b>blameless.</b> Not sinless, but sanctified (see <a ref='Ephesians 1:4'>Eph 1:4</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:27'>5:27</a> ; <a ref='Colossians 1:22'>Col 1:22</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 14:6'>14:6</a> <b>midheaven.</b> From a Greek term denoting the point in the noonday sky where the sun reaches its zenith. This is the highest and brightest point, where all can see and hear. <b>an eternal gospel.</b> The angel is preaching the good news concerning eternal life and entrance into the kingdom of God (cf. <a ref='Matthew 24:14'>Mt 24:14</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:1–10'>1Co 15:1–10</a> ). He is urging the people of the world to change their allegiance from the beast to the Lamb. It is also called in the NT the gospel of God, the gospel of grace, the gospel of Christ, the gospel of peace, the glorious gospel, and the gospel of the kingdom. It is good news that God saves by the forgiveness of sin and opens His kingdom to all who will repent and believe. The whole world will hear this preaching by the angel as God graciously calls all to salvation. <a ref='Revelation 14:7'>14:7</a> <b>Fear God.</b> Not Satan, nor Antichrist. This is the theme of Scripture, calling people to give honor, glory, worship, and reverence to God (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 23:17'>Pr 23:17</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 2:17'>1Pe 2:17</a> ). <i>See notes on <a ref='Romans 1:18–21'>Ro 1:18–21</a> .</i> <b>hour of His judgment has come.</b> The last moment arrives to repent and believe before God’s wrath is poured out. This is the book’s first use of the word judgment, a term that has the same meaning as wrath (see <a ref='Revelation 6:17'>6:17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:12'>12:12</a> ). <b>Him who made the heaven and the earth.</b> Creation is the great proof of God, which preachers will appeal to as the ground for all people to believe in Him and worship Him (cf. <a ref='Revelation 4:11'>4:11</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 10:6'>10:6</a> ; <a ref='John 1:9'>Jn 1:9</a> ; <a ref='Acts 14:15–17'>Ac 14:15–17</a> ; <a ref='Acts 17:23–28'>17:23–28</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 14:8'>14:8</a> fallen is Babylon <b>.</b> Lack of response to the first angel’s message causes a second angel to pronounce this judgment. Babylon refers to the entire worldwide political, economic, and religious kingdom of Antichrist. (Cf. <a ref='Revelation 16:17–19'>16:17–19</a> for details of this fall.) The original city of Babylon was the birthplace of idolatry where the residents built the Tower of Babel, a monument to rebelliousness and false religion. Such idolatry was subsequently spread when God confounded man’s language and scattered them around the world (cf. <a ref='Genesis 11:1–9'>Ge 11:1–9</a> ). <b>wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality.</b> This pictures Babylon causing the world to become intoxicated with her pleasures and enter an orgy of rebellion, hatred, and idolatry toward God. Fornication is spiritual prostitution to Antichrist’s false system, which will fall for such iniquity. <a ref='Revelation 14:9'>14:9</a> <b>worships the beast.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Revelation 13:14–15'>13:14–15</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Revelation 13:8'>13:8</a> . <a ref='Revelation 14:10'>14:10</a> <b>cup of His rage.</b> Anyone loyal to the Antichrist and his kingdom will suffer the outpouring of God’s collected wrath, done with the full force of His divine anger and unmitigated vengeance (cf. <a ref='Psalms 75:8'>Ps 75:8</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 51:17'>Is 51:17</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 25:15–16'>Jer 25:15–16</a> ). Divine wrath is not an impulsive outburst of anger aimed capriciously at people God does not like. It is the settled, steady, merciless, graceless, and compassionless response of a righteous God against sin. <b>fire and brimstone.</b> These are two elements that are often associated in Scripture with the torment of divine punishment ( <a ref='Genesis 19:24–25'>Ge 19:24–25</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 34:8–10'>Is 34:8–10</a> ). Here the reference is to hell, the lake of fire (cf. <a ref='Revelation 19:20'>19:20</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:10'>20:10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 21:8'>21:8</a> ). Brimstone is a fiery sulfur ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 9:17'>9:17</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 14:11'>14:11</a> <b>torment goes up forever and ever.</b> A reference to the eternality of hell (cf. <a ref='Matthew 3:12'>Mt 3:12</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 13:41–42'>13:41–42</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 25:41'>25:41</a> ; <a ref='Mark 9:48'>Mk 9:48</a> ). Torment is the ceaseless infliction of unbearable pain (cf. <a ref='Luke 16:23–24'>Lk 16:23–24</a> ), here prescribed for all who are loyal to Satan’s leader. <a ref='Revelation 14:12'>14:12</a> This is excellent scriptural support for the doctrine of perseverance, which assures all true believers in Christ that they will never lose their faith. The regenerate will continually endure, right to the end, in obedience to the truth, no matter what may come against them ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Romans 8:31–39'>Ro 8:31–39</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 1:6'>Php 1:6</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 32:40'>Jer 32:40</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:13'>Mt 24:13</a> ; <a ref='John 6:35–40'>Jn 6:35–40</a> ; <a ref='John 10:27–30'>10:27–30</a> ; <a ref='1 John 5:4'>1Jn 5:4</a> , <a ref='1 John 5:11–13'>11–13</a> , <a ref='1 John 5:20'>20</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 14:13'>14:13</a> <b>Blessed.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:3'>1:3</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 14:14'>14:14</a> <b>son of man.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:13'>1:13</a> .</i> The imagery of the Lord on a cloud is from <a ref='Daniel 7:13–14'>Da 7:13–14</a> and emphasizes magnificent majesty (cf. <a ref='Revelation 1:7'>1:7</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:30'>Mt 24:30</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 26:64'>26:64</a> ; <a ref='Acts 1:9–11'>Ac 1:9–11</a> ). <b>golden crown.</b> The victor’s crown, a laurel wreath, worn by those who celebrated victory in war or athletic competition.

It represents swift and devastating judgment. <a ref='Revelation 14:15'>14:15</a> <b>harvest of the earth.</b> The grain—in this case the ungodly people of the world—is ready to be gathered up and judged. <a ref='Revelation 14:17'>14:17</a> <b>sanctuary.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 11:19'>11:19</a> .</i> This refers to the heavenly dwelling place of God, not the Tribulation temple in Jerusalem (cf. <a ref='Revelation 11:1'>11:1</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 14:18'>14:18</a> <b>another angel … who has authority over fire.</b> This angel is associated with fire on the altar, which represents the prayers of the saints ( <a ref='Revelation 6:9–11'>6:9–11</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 8:3–5'>8:3–5</a> ). Fire refers to the constantly burning fire on the brass altar of the Jerusalem temple. Twice daily the priest would burn incense with that fire and offer the burning incense in the Holy Place as a symbol of the people’s prayers ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Revelation 5:8'>5:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 6:9'>6:9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 8:3'>8:3</a></i> ).

Here it refers to the slaughter of all the enemies of God who are still alive, facing the destruction at Armageddon, the final battle against God’s enemies, staged on the Plain of Esdraelon. The bloody imagery comes from the fresh juice of stomped grapes splattering and running down a trough from the upper vat to the lower vat of a stone winepress. <a ref='Revelation 14:20'>14:20</a> <b>outside the city.</b> God will determine that this bloodbath will occur outside Jerusalem, as if God wants to protect the city from the carnage all around. <a ref='Zechariah 14:1–5'>Zechariah 14:1–5</a> makes clear that Jerusalem will be attacked, but will not be destroyed in the end, but spared for the glory of the kingdom, and the believing remnant will be saved as the Lord defends them and the city against the nations. They will escape through a newly created valley as the Lord finishes judgment and sets up His kingdom. <b>up to the horses’ bridles.</b> The severity of the slaughter is indicated in the imagery of the blood of those killed in the Battle of Armageddon splattering as high (about 4 ft.) as the bridles of the horses involved. Equally likely, if the battle occurs near the central valley of Israel, the tremendous volume and flow of blood could easily form troughs 4 ft. deep in some places. This event clearly is described in <a ref='Revelation 19:11–21'>19:11–21</a> . <a ref='Ezekiel 39:8–16'>Ezekiel 39:8–16</a> may be describing the cleanup. <b>1,600 stadia.</b> The approximate distance from Armageddon in the north of Israel to Edom in the south. The great battle will rage across that entire area and even slightly beyond. <a ref='Revelation 15:1–8'>15:1–8</a> Chapter <a ref='Rev 15'>15</a> introduces the 7 bowls of wrath, God’s final judgments at the end of the 7-year Tribulation period. The bowl judgments come in a rapid-fire, staccato fashion, each one stronger in fury and intensity. The bowls are the last plagues that issue from the blast of the seventh trumpet, and will conclude the seventh seal ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 6:1'>6:1</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 15:1'>15:1</a> <b>wrath of God.</b> <i>See notes on <a ref='Revelation 11:18'>11:18</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:10'>14:10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:19'>16:19</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:15'>19:15</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Romans 1:18–21'>Ro 1:18–21</a> . <a ref='Revelation 15:2'>15:2</a> <b>sea of glass.</b> God’s heavenly throne sits on a transparent crystal platform or pavement ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 4:6'>4:6</a></i> ). <b>overcome the beast.</b> All the saints from every nation, including Israel, ultimately triumph over Satan’s Antichrist and his system because of their faith in Jesus Christ. <b>number of his name.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 13:17'>13:17</a> .</i> <b>harps.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 5:8'>5:8</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 15:3'>15:3</a> <b>song of Moses.</b> Sung by the people of Israel immediately after their passage through the Red Sea and their deliverance from the Egyptian armies ( <a ref='Exodus 15:1–21'>Ex 15:1–21</a> ; cf. <a ref='Deuteronomy 32:1–43'>Dt 32:1–43</a> ), this was a song of victory and deliverance that the redeemed who overcome Antichrist and his system will readily identify with. <b>song of the Lamb.</b> See <a ref='Revelation 5:8–14'>5:8–14</a> .

After God’s righteous judgment is complete, He will set up Christ’s millennial kingdom on earth, and the elect from every nation will come and worship Him (cf. <a ref='Psalms 66:4'>Ps 66:4</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 66:23'>Is 66:23</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 2:9–11'>Php 2:9–11</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 15:5'>15:5</a> <b>the sanctuary of the tabernacle of testimony.</b> This refers to the location of the ark of the covenant in the Holy of Holies where God dwells ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 11:19'>11:19</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Numbers 10:11'>Nu 10:11</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 15:6'>15:6</a> <b>seven plagues.</b> The final, most severe judgments from God, described in chap. <a ref='Rev 16'>16</a> ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Revelation 15:1'>1</a></i> ). <b>linen … golden sashes.</b> The fabric represents holiness and purity ( <a ref='Revelation 19:14'>19:14</a> ).

In the NT, it describes the open sores that covered the beggar Lazarus ( <a ref='Luke 16:21'>Lk 16:21</a> ). All over the world, people will be afflicted with incurable, open, oozing sores. <b>mark of the beast.</b> Only the worshipers of Antichrist will be afflicted ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 13:16'>13:16</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Revelation 14:9–11'>14:9–11</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 16:3'>16:3</a> <b>second … bowl … every living thing in the sea died.</b> This is reminiscent of the second trumpet ( <a ref='Revelation 8:8–9'>8:8–9</a> ), and of the first plague against Egypt ( <a ref='Exodus 7:20–25'>Ex 7:20–25</a> ). This plague, however, will be far more widespread. The water in the world’s oceans will become thick, dark, and coagulated, like the blood of a corpse. The death and decay of billions of sea creatures will only add to the misery of this judgment. <a ref='Revelation 16:4'>16:4</a> <b>third … bowl … rivers and the springs of waters.</b> Fresh water, already in short supply because of the prolonged drought ( <a ref='Revelation 11:6'>11:6</a> ), will now suffer the fate of the oceans (cf. <a ref='Exodus 7:19'>Ex 7:19ff.</a> ). In addition to suffering from thirst, the worshipers of Antichrist will have no clean water with which to wash their sores. <a ref='Revelation 16:5'>16:5</a> <b>who is and who was.</b> This phrase expresses God’s eternality (cf. <a ref='Revelation 1:4'>1:4</a> , <a ref='Revelation 1:8'>8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 4:8'>4:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:17'>11:17</a> ). Verse <a ref='Revelation 16:6'>6</a> says that the eternal God will judge justly because they have killed the believers and preachers of the gospel ( <a ref='Revelation 6:9–11'>6:9–11</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 7:9–17'>7:9–17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:18'>11:18</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 17:6'>17:6</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 18:20'>18:20</a> ). This slaughter will have no parallel in history ( <a ref='Matthew 24:21'>Mt 24:21</a> ) and neither will the vengeance of God (cf. <a ref='Romans 12:19–21'>Ro 12:19–21</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 16:6'>16:6</a> <b>given them blood to drink.</b> The thick, blood-like substance which the fresh waters have become is all that is available to drink (cf. v. <a ref='Revelation 16:4'>4</a> ). <b>They deserve it.</b> The angel exonerates God from any charge that His judgments are too harsh. The unspeakably wicked generation then alive will shed more blood than any before it, including that of saints ( <a ref='Revelation 6:9'>6:9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 17:6'>17:6</a> ) and prophets ( <a ref='Revelation 11:7–10'>11:7–10</a> ).

With no fresh water to drink, earth’s inhabitants will face extreme heat. The scorching heat will melt the polar ice caps, which some estimate would raise the level of the world’s oceans by 200 ft., inundating many of the world’s major cities and producing further catastrophic loss of life (cf. <a ref='Amos 9:5–6'>Am 9:5–6</a> ). The resulting disruption of ocean transportation will make it difficult to distribute the dwindling resources of food and water. <a ref='Revelation 16:9'>16:9</a> <b>they did not repent.</b> Incredibly, sinners will still refuse to repent (cf. vv. <a ref='Revelation 16:11'>11</a> , <a ref='Revelation 16:21'>21</a> ), and instead blaspheme God—the One they know has caused their afflictions. <a ref='Revelation 16:10'>16:10</a> <b>fifth … bowl … throne of the beast.</b> This refers to either Antichrist’s actual throne, or his capital city, but extends to all his dominion. Regardless of where the darkness begins, it eventually covers Antichrist’s entire kingdom. <b>darkened.</b> Worldwide darkness is elsewhere associated with the judgment of God (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 60:2'>Is 60:2</a> ; <a ref='Joel 2:2'>Joel 2:2</a> ; <a ref='Mark 13:24–25'>Mk 13:24–25</a> ). <b>gnawed their tongues.</b> A futile attempt to alleviate the pain from their sores, the drought, and the fierce heat. <a ref='Revelation 16:11'>16:11</a> <b>blasphemed the God of heaven.</b> A sign of their continued loyalty to Antichrist and their anger at God for the cumulative miseries brought about by the first 5 bowls. “God of heaven,” a frequent OT title for God, appears in the NT only here and in <a ref='Revelation 11:13'>11:13</a> . <b>their sores.</b> The lingering effects of the first bowl are the chief cause of their blasphemy. <a ref='Revelation 16:12'>16:12</a> <b>sixth … bowl … Euphrates.</b> Called “the great river” 5 times in Scripture (cf. <a ref='Revelation 9:14'>9:14</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 15:18'>Ge 15:18</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:7'>Dt 1:7</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 1:4'>Jos 1:4</a> ), it flows some 1,800 mi. from its source on the slopes of Mt. Ararat to the Persian Gulf ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 9:14'>9:14</a></i> ). It forms the eastern boundary of the land God promised to Israel ( <a ref='Genesis 15:18'>Ge 15:18</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 1:7'>Dt 1:7</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 11:24'>11:24</a> ; <a ref='Joshua 1:4'>Jos 1:4</a> ). With its flow already reduced by the prolonged drought and intensified heat, God supernaturally will dry it up to make way for the eastern confederacy to reach Israel ( <a ref='Isaiah 11:15'>Is 11:15</a> ). <b>the kings from the east.</b> God providentially draws these kings and their armies in order to destroy them in the battle of Armageddon (v. <a ref='Revelation 16:14'>14</a> ). Their reason for coming may be to rebel against Antichrist, whose failure to alleviate the world’s suffering will no doubt erode his popularity. Or, this may be a final act of rabid anti-Semitism intent on destroying Israel, perhaps in retaliation for the plagues sent by her God. Since the sun may have melted the ice caps on Ararat, flooding the valley of the Euphrates as the river overflows its banks and bridges, the land will be swamped. God will have to dry it up miraculously for the eastern army to get to Armageddon. <a ref='Revelation 16:13'>16:13</a> <b>the dragon … the beast … the false prophet.</b> The “unholy trinity,” composed of Satan (the dragon; <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 12:3'>12:3</a></i> ), the Antichrist (the beast; <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 11:7'>11:7</a></i> ), and Antichrist’s associate (the false prophet; <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 13:11'>13:11</a></i> ), spew out this plague. <b>three unclean spirits.</b> A common NT designation for demons (cf. <a ref='Matthew 12:43'>Mt 12:43</a> ; <a ref='Mark 1:23'>Mk 1:23</a> ; <a ref='Luke 8:29'>Lk 8:29</a> ). These are especially vile, powerful, and deceitful (v. <a ref='Revelation 16:14'>14</a> ). <b>like frogs.</b> This figure further emphasizes their vileness. Frogs were unclean animals according to OT dietary laws ( <a ref='Leviticus 11:10–11'>Lv 11:10–11</a> , <a ref='Leviticus 11:41'>41</a> ). Persian mythology viewed them as plague-inducing creatures. The demons are thus described as slimy, cold-blooded, loathsome beings. <a ref='Revelation 16:14'>16:14</a> <b>signs.</b> These are supernatural wonders (cf. <a ref='Revelation 13:12–15'>13:12–15</a> ) designed to deceive (cf. <a ref='Revelation 19:20'>19:20</a> ; <a ref='1 Kings 22:20–23'>1Ki 22:20–23</a> ; <a ref='Mark 13:22'>Mk 13:22</a> ) the kings into invading Palestine. Their impact will be so great that the unclean spirits are able to induce the kings to make the journey to Palestine in spite of their sores, the intense heat, drought, and darkness. <b>kings of the whole world.</b> No longer just the eastern confederacy, but now all the world begins to gather in Palestine for the final, climactic battle ( <a ref='Psalms 2:2–3'>Ps 2:2–3</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:2–4'>Joel 3:2–4</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:1–3'>Zec 14:1–3</a> ). <b>the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.</b> The Battle of Armageddon (v. <a ref='Revelation 16:16'>16</a> ). It is the great war with God and Christ ( <i>see notes on <a ref='2 Thessalonians 1:7–10'>2Th 1:7–10</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='Joel 2:11'>Joel 2:11</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:2'>3:2</a> , <a ref='Joel 3:4'>4</a> ).

The imagery pictures a soldier ready for battle, or a homeowner watchful for the arrival of a thief (see also <a ref='Revelation 3:3'>3:3</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:2'>1Th 5:2</a> , <a ref='1 Thessalonians 5:4'>4</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 3:10'>2Pe 3:10</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 16:16'>16:16</a> <b>Har-Magedon.</b> The Hebrew name for Mt. Megiddo, 60 mi. north of Jerusalem. The battle will rage on the nearby plains, site of Barak’s victory over the Canaanites ( <a ref='Jdg 4'>Jdg 4</a> ), and Gideon’s victory over the Midianites ( <a ref='Jdg 7'>Jdg 7</a> ). Napoleon called this valley the greatest battlefield he had ever seen. But the Battle of Armageddon will not be limited to the Megiddo plains—it will encompass the length of Palestine ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 14:20'>14:20</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 16:17'>16:17</a> <b>seventh … bowl … “It is done.”</b> This bowl will complete God’s wrath (except for final judgment on the rebellion at the end of the Millennium; <a ref='Revelation 20:7–10'>20:7–10</a> ) and immediately precedes the second coming of Christ. It will usher in the worst calamity in the history of the world. The voice from the temple in heaven is undoubtedly that of God Himself. “It is done” is best translated, “It has been and will remain done” (cf. <a ref='John 19:30'>Jn 19:30</a> ). God will punctuate the completion of His wrath with a devastating earthquake—the most powerful in earth’s history (cf. vv. <a ref='Revelation 16:19–21'>19–21</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 16:19'>16:19</a> <b>the great city.</b> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 11:13'>11:13</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 21:10'>21:10</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Zechariah 14:1–8'>Zec 14:1–8</a></i> . Jerusalem will be split into 3 parts ( <a ref='Zechariah 14:4'>Zec 14:4</a> ), not as a judgment (cf. <a ref='Revelation 11:13'>11:13</a> ), but as an improvement. The additional water supply ( <a ref='Zechariah 14:8'>Zec 14:8</a> ) and topographical changes ( <a ref='Zechariah 14:4–5'>Zec 14:4–5</a> ) will prepare the city for its central place in the millennial kingdom. Jerusalem is the only city to be spared the judgment (cf. <a ref='1 Chronicles 23:25'>1Chr 23:25</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 125:1–2'>Ps 125:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:7'>Mic 4:7</a> ) and will be made more beautiful ( <a ref='Psalms 48:2'>Ps 48:2</a> ), because of her repentance (see <a ref='Revelation 11:13'>11:13</a> ). <b>cities of the nations.</b> God’s purpose is very different for the rest of the world’s cities—they are to be destroyed. <b>Babylon.</b> The capital of the Antichrist’s empire will receive a special outpouring of God’s wrath as prophesied in <a ref='Isaiah 13:6–13'>Is 13:6–13</a> .

Chapters <a ref='Rev 17-18'>17–18</a> focus on one aspect of those bowl judgments, the judgment of Babylon. The judgments already described are identified as targeting the final world system. <b>great harlot.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 14:8'>14:8</a> .</i> Prostitution frequently symbolizes idolatry or religious apostasy (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 3:6–9'>Jer 3:6–9</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 16:30'>Eze 16:30ff.</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 20:30'>20:30</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 4:15'>Hos 4:15</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 5:3'>5:3</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 6:10'>6:10</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 9:1'>9:1</a> ).

The picture is of a ruler seated on a throne, ruling the waters, which symbolize the nations of the world (see v. <a ref='Revelation 17:15'>15</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 17:2'>17:2</a> <b>kings … committed sexual immorality.</b> The harlot will ally herself with the world’s political leaders. Fornication here does not refer to sexual sin, but to idolatry ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 14:8'>14:8</a></i> ). All the world rulers will be absorbed into the empire of Satan’s false christ. <b>wine of her sexual immorality.</b> The harlot’s influence will extend beyond the world’s rulers to the rest of mankind (cf. v. <a ref='Revelation 17:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:8'>13:8</a> , <a ref='Revelation 13:14'>14</a> ). The imagery does not describe actual wine and sexual sin, but pictures the world’s people being swept up into the intoxication and sin of a false system of religion. <a ref='Revelation 17:3'>17:3</a> <b>in the Spirit.</b> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 1:10'>1:10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 4:2'>4:2</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 21:10'>21:10</a> . The Holy Spirit transports John into the wilderness (a deserted, lonely, desolate wasteland), perhaps to give him a better understanding of the vision. <b>a woman.</b> The harlot of v. <a ref='Revelation 17:1'>1</a> , Babylon. <b>scarlet beast.</b> The Antichrist (cf. <a ref='Revelation 13:1'>13:1</a> , <a ref='Revelation 13:4'>4</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:9'>14:9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:10'>16:10</a> ), who for a time will support and use the false religious system to effect world unity. Then he will assume political control (cf. v. <a ref='Revelation 17:16'>16</a> ). Scarlet is the color of luxury, splendor, and royalty. <b>full of blasphemous names.</b> Because of his self-deification (cf. <a ref='Revelation 13:1'>13:1</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 7:25'>Da 7:25</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 11:36'>11:36</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:4'>2Th 2:4</a> ). <b>having seven heads and ten horns.</b> This pictures the extent of Antichrist’s political alliances ( <i>see notes on vv. <a ref='Revelation 17:9–12'>9–12</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 13:1'>13:1</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 17:4'>17:4</a> <b>purple and scarlet.</b> The colors of royalty, nobility, and wealth. The woman is portrayed as a prostitute who has plied her trade successfully and become extremely wealthy. <b>adorned.</b> Prostitutes often dress in fine clothes and precious jewels to allure their victims (cf. <a ref='Proverbs 7:10'>Pr 7:10</a> ). The religious harlot Babylon is no different, adorning herself to lure the nations into her grasp. <b>a gold cup.</b> Still another evidence of the harlot’s great wealth (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 51:7'>Jer 51:7</a> ); but the pure gold is defiled by the filthiness of her immorality. Just as a prostitute might first get her victim drunk, so the harlot system deceives the nations into committing spiritual fornication with her. <a ref='Revelation 17:5'>17:5</a> <b>forehead.</b> It was customary for Roman prostitutes to wear a headband with their name on it (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 3:3'>Jer 3:3</a> ) parading their wretchedness for all to see. The harlot’s forehead is emblazoned with a 3-fold title descriptive of the world’s final false religious system. <b>mystery.</b> A NT mystery is truth once hidden, but in the NT revealed. <i>See notes on <a ref='Matthew 13:11'>Mt 13:11</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 3:4–5'>Eph 3:4–5</a> .</i> Spiritual Babylon’s true identity is yet to be revealed. Thus, the precise details of how it will be manifested in the world are not yet known. <b>BABYLON THE GREAT.</b> This Babylon is distinct from the historical, geographical city of Babylon (which still existed in John’s day). The details of John’s vision cannot be applied to any historical city ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 14:8'>14:8</a></i> ). <b>MOTHER OF HARLOTS.</b> All false religion stems ultimately from Babel, or Babylon (cf. <a ref='Ge 11'>Ge 11</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 14:8'>14:8</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 17:6'>17:6</a> <b>the blood of the saints … witnesses of Jesus.</b> Some see the first group as OT saints, and the second as NT saints—an unimportant distinction since this pictures the “witnesses,” or martyrs, of the Tribulation. John’s point is that the harlot is a murderer. False religion has killed millions of believers over the centuries, and the final false system will be far more deadly than any that preceded it. <a ref='Revelation 17:7'>17:7</a> <b>mystery.</b> Not that Babylon is a false system of religion, because that is already known, but that the beast will fully support the harlot and together exert vast influence over the whole earth. <a ref='Revelation 17:8'>17:8</a> <b>The beast.</b> Both a king and kingdom are referred to by this term. <b>was, and is not, and is about to come up.</b> A reference to the Antichrist’s false resurrection ( <a ref='Revelation 13:3'>13:3</a> , <a ref='Revelation 13:4'>4</a> , <a ref='Revelation 13:12–14'>12–14</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 13:3'>13:3</a></i> ). <b>out of the abyss.</b> After his “resurrection,” the Antichrist will become possessed by a great demon from the abyss ( <i>see notes on <a ref='Revelation 13:1'>13:1</a> , <a ref='Revelation 13:3'>3</a></i> ). <b>destruction.</b> Eternal destruction (cf. v. <a ref='Revelation 17:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 7:13'>Mt 7:13</a> ; <a ref='John 17:12'>Jn 17:12</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 1:28'>Php 1:28</a> ; <a ref='Philippians 3:19'>3:19</a> ; <a ref='2 Thessalonians 2:3'>2Th 2:3</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:39'>Heb 10:39</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 2:3'>2Pe 2:3</a> ; <a ref='2 Peter 3:7'>3:7</a> , <a ref='2 Peter 3:16'>16</a> ). This is the lake of fire, the place of Antichrist’s destruction ( <a ref='Revelation 19:20'>19:20</a> ). <b>book of life.</b> The roll of the elect, written in eternity past by God ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 3:5'>3:5</a></i> ). Only the elect will escape the Antichrist’s deception ( <a ref='Matthew 24:24'>Mt 24:24</a> ). <b>from the foundation of the world.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 13:8'>13:8</a></i> ; cf. <a ref='2 Timothy 1:9'>2Ti 1:9</a> ; <a ref='Titus 1:2'>Tit 1:2</a> (“long ages ago”). A frequent phrase ( <a ref='Matthew 13:35'>Mt 13:35</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 25:34'>25:34</a> ; <a ref='Luke 11:50'>Lk 11:50</a> ; <a ref='John 17:24'>Jn 17:24</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 1:4'>Eph 1:4</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 4:3'>Heb 4:3</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 9:26'>9:26</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:20'>1Pe 1:20</a> ) referring to God’s pre-creation plan. <a ref='Revelation 17:9'>17:9</a> <b>seven mountains.</b> The Greek word is often used of hills ( <a ref='Matthew 5:1'>Mt 5:1</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 15:29'>15:29</a> ; <a ref='John 6:15'>Jn 6:15</a> ; <a ref='John 8:1'>8:1</a> ). Many commentators interpret this expression to mean Rome, which sits on 7 hills. It is true that the final worldwide system of false religion includes, but is not necessarily limited to, Rome; but specifically, the 7 mountains in context likely symbolize the 7 kingdoms and their kings of v. <a ref='Revelation 17:10'>10</a> . <a ref='Revelation 17:10'>17:10</a> <b>seven kings.</b> Representatives of the 7 great world empires (Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and that of the Antichrist). Cf.

The Greek text views the results of this as if it had already taken place ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 14:8'>14:8</a></i> ). But the seventh bowl is being referred to here, and it is yet to come at this point ( <a ref='Revelation 16:17–21'>16:17–21</a> ). When it comes, devastation and annihilation will take place, leaving the place to demons. <a ref='Revelation 18:3'>18:3</a> <b>wine … of her sexual immorality.</b> Religious Babylon (chap. <a ref='Rev 17'>17</a> ) lures the nations into spiritual drunkenness and fornication with false gods ( <a ref='Revelation 17:2'>17:2</a> , <a ref='Revelation 17:4'>4</a> ); commercial Babylon (chap. <a ref='Rev 18'>18</a> ) seduces the unbelieving world into a materialistic stupor, so that the people of the world will become drunk with passion because of their relationship with Babylon. <b>kings … merchants.</b> Political rulers and corporate leaders alike are swept up in this worldwide system of commerce ( <a ref='Revelation 14:8'>14:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 17:2'>17:2</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 18:4'>18:4</a> <b>Come out of her, my people.</b> God will call His own to disentangle themselves from this evil system. This may also be God’s calling the elect to abandon the world system and come to faith in the Savior. In either case, the message is to abandon the system before it is destroyed (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 6:17'>2Co 6:17</a> ; <a ref='1 John 2:15'>1Jn 2:15</a> ). The judgment of God on that society living in sinful, arrogant self-indulgence can be avoided. Cf. Isaiah’s and Jeremiah’s message to their people to leave Babylon ( <a ref='Isaiah 48:20'>Is 48:20</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 50:8'>Jer 50:8</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 51:6–9'>51:6–9</a> , <a ref='Jeremiah 51:45'>45</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 18:5'>18:5</a> <b>remembered.</b> See <a ref='Revelation 16:19'>16:19</a> .

For unrepentant Babylon, there will be no such forgiveness, only judgment. <a ref='Revelation 18:6–7'>18:6–7</a> <b>Pay her back.</b> The angel calls for God to recompense wrath to Babylon in her own cup to repay her according to her deeds ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 17:4'>17:4</a></i> ). This is an echo of the OT law of retaliation ( <a ref='Exodus 21:24'>Ex 21:24</a> ) which will be implemented by God ( <a ref='Romans 12:17–21'>Ro 12:17–21</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 18:6'>18:6</a> <b>double.</b> Has the sense of “full,” or “overflowing.” The punishment will fit the crime (cf. <a ref='Jeremiah 16:18'>Jer 16:18</a> ). <b>cup.</b> The cup of wickedness from which so many have drunk ( <a ref='Revelation 14:8'>14:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 17:2'>17:2</a> , <a ref='Revelation 17:4'>4</a> , <a ref='Revelation 17:6'>6</a> ) will call for the cup of wrath ( <a ref='Revelation 14:10'>14:10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:19'>16:19</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 18:7'>18:7b</a> am not a widow <b>.</b> A proud, but empty, boast of self-sufficiency, also made by historical Babylon ( <a ref='Isaiah 47:8'>Is 47:8</a> ).

This exclamation, meaning “Praise the Lord,” occurs frequently in the OT (cf. <a ref='Psalms 104:35'>Pss 104:35</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 105:45'>105:45</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 106:1'>106:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 111:1'>111:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 112:1'>112:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 113:1'>113:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 117:1'>117:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 135:1'>135:1</a> ; <a ref='Psalms 146:1'>146:1</a> ). Five reasons for their praise emerge: 1) God’s deliverance of His people from their enemies (v. <a ref='Revelation 19:1'>1</a> ); 2) God’s meting out of justice (v. <a ref='Revelation 19:2'>2</a> ); 3) God’s permanent crushing of man’s rebellion (v. <a ref='Revelation 19:3'>3</a> ); 4) God’s sovereignty (v. <a ref='Revelation 19:6'>6</a> ); and 5) God’s communion with His people (v. <a ref='Revelation 19:7'>7</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 19:2'>19:2</a> judgments <b>.</b> Saints long for the day of judgment (cf. <a ref='Revelation 6:10'>6:10</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:7'>16:7</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 9:7'>Is 9:7</a> ; <a ref='Jeremiah 23:5'>Jer 23:5</a> ). Godly people love righteousness and hate sin, for righteousness honors God and sin mocks Him. Believers long for a world of justice and it will come (v. <a ref='Revelation 19:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 2:27'>2:27</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 12:5'>12:5</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 19:3'>19:3</a> smoke rises <b>.</b> This is because of the fire (cf. <a ref='Revelation 17:16'>17:16</a> , <a ref='Revelation 17:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 18:8–9'>18:8–9</a> , <a ref='Revelation 18:18'>18</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 14:8–11'>14:8–11</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 19:4'>19:4</a> <b>twenty-four elders.</b> Best understood as representatives of the church ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 4:4'>4:4</a></i> ). <b>four living creatures.</b> A special order of angelic beings ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 4:6'>4:6</a></i> ). These compose the same group as in <a ref='Revelation 7:11'>7:11</a> and are associated with worship frequently ( <a ref='Revelation 4:8'>4:8</a> , <a ref='Revelation 4:11'>11</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 5:9–12'>5:9–12</a> , <a ref='Revelation 5:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:16–18'>11:16–18</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 19:5'>19:5</a> <b>the small and the great.</b> All distinctions and ranks are to be transcended. <a ref='Revelation 19:6'>19:6</a> <b>the Almighty.</b> Used 9 times in Revelation as a title for God (cf. v. <a ref='Revelation 19:15'>15</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 1:8'>1:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 4:8'>4:8</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:17'>11:17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 15:3'>15:3</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 16:7'>16:7</a> , <a ref='Revelation 16:14'>14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 21:22'>21:22</a> ). The great praise of the multitude sounds like a massive crashing of waves. <a ref='Revelation 19:7'>19:7</a> <b>marriage of the Lamb.</b> Hebrew weddings consisted of 3 phases: 1) betrothal (often when the couple were children); 2) presentation (the festivities, often lasting several days, that preceded the ceremony); and 3) the ceremony (the exchanging of vows). The church was betrothed to Christ by His sovereign choice in eternity past ( <a ref='Ephesians 1:4'>Eph 1:4</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 13:20'>Heb 13:20</a> ) and will be presented to Him at the Rapture ( <a ref='John 14:1–3'>Jn 14:1–3</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:13–18'>1Th 4:13–18</a> ). The final supper will signify the end of the ceremony. This symbolic meal will take place at the establishment of the millennial kingdom and last throughout that 1,000-year period (cf. <a ref='Revelation 21:2'>21:2</a> ). While the term “bride” often refers to the church, and does so here ( <a ref='2 Corinthians 11:2'>2Co 11:2</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:22–24'>Eph 5:22–24</a> ), it ultimately expands to include all the redeemed of all ages, which becomes clear in the remainder of the book. <a ref='Revelation 19:8'>19:8</a> <b>righteous acts of the saints.</b> Not Christ’s imputed righteousness granted to believers at salvation, but the practical results of that righteousness in believers’ lives, i.e., the outward manifestation of inward virtue. <a ref='Revelation 19:9'>19:9</a> <b>Blessed.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:3'>1:3</a> .</i> <b>those who are invited.</b> This is not the bride (the church), but the guests. The bride doesn’t get invited, she invites. These are those saved before Pentecost, all the faithful believers saved by grace through faith up to the birth of the church ( <a ref='Acts 2:1'>Ac 2:1ff.</a> ). Though they are not the bride, they still are glorified and reign with Christ in the millennial kingdom. It is really differing imagery rather than differing reality. The guests also will include tribulation saints and believers alive in earthly bodies in the kingdom. The church is the bride, pure and faithful—never a harlot, like Israel was (see <a ref='Ho 2'>Hos 2</a> ). So the church is the bride during the presentation feast in heaven, then comes to earth for the celebration of the final meal (the Millennium).

The nature of this event shows how it differs from the Rapture. At the Rapture, Christ meets His own in the air—in this event He comes with them to earth. At the Rapture, there is no judgment; in this event it is all judgment. This event is preceded by blackness—the darkened sun, moon gone out, stars fallen, smoke—then lightning and blinding glory as Jesus comes. Such details are not included in Rapture passages ( <a ref='John 14:1–3'>Jn 14:1–3</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:13–18'>1Th 4:13–18</a> ). <b>white horse.</b> In the Roman triumphal processions, the victorious general rode his white war horse up the Via Sacra to the temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. Jesus’ first coming was in humiliation on a colt ( <a ref='Zechariah 9:9'>Zec 9:9</a> ). John’s vision portrays Him as the conqueror on His warhorse, coming to destroy the wicked, to overthrow the Antichrist, to defeat Satan, and to take control of the earth (cf. <a ref='2 Corinthians 2:14'>2Co 2:14</a> ). <b>Faithful and True.</b> True to His word, Jesus will return to earth ( <a ref='Matthew 24:27–31'>Mt 24:27–31</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 3:14'>3:14</a></i> ). <b>in righteousness He judges.</b> See <a ref='Revelation 20:11–15'>20:11–15</a> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 25:31'>Mt 25:31ff.</a> ; <a ref='John 5:25–30'>Jn 5:25–30</a> ; <a ref='Acts 17:31'>Ac 17:31</a> . <b>wages war.</b> This startling statement, appearing only here and <a ref='Revelation 2:16'>2:16</a> , vividly portrays the holy wrath of God against sinners (cf. <a ref='Psalms 7:11'>Ps 7:11</a> ).

There are 3 main views of the duration and nature of this period: 1) Premillennialism sees this as a literal 1,000-year period during which Jesus Christ, in fulfillment of numerous prophecies (e.g., <a ref='2 Samuel 7:12–16'>2Sa 7:12–16</a> ; <a ref='Ps 2'>Ps 2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 11:6–12'>Is 11:6–12</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 24:23'>24:23</a> ; <a ref='Hosea 3:4–5'>Hos 3:4–5</a> ; <a ref='Joel 3:9–21'>Joel 3:9–21</a> ; <a ref='Amos 9:8–15'>Am 9:8–15</a> ; <a ref='Micah 4:1–8'>Mic 4:1–8</a> ; <a ref='Zephaniah 3:14–20'>Zep 3:14–20</a> ; <a ref='Zechariah 14:1–11'>Zec 14:1–11</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 24:29–31'>Mt 24:29–31</a> , <a ref='Matthew 24:36–44'>36–44</a> ), reigns on the earth. Using the same general principles of interpretation for both prophetic and nonprophetic passages leads most naturally to premillennialism. Another strong argument supporting this view is that so many biblical prophecies have already been literally fulfilled, suggesting that future prophecies will likewise be fulfilled literally. 2) Postmillennialism understands the reference to a 1,000-year period as only symbolic of a golden age of righteousness and spiritual prosperity. It will be ushered in by the spread of the gospel during the present church age and brought to completion when Christ returns. According to this view, references to Christ’s reign on earth primarily describe His spiritual reign in the hearts of believers in the church. 3) Amillennialism understands the 1,000 years to be merely symbolic of a long period of time. This view interprets OT prophecies of a Millennium as being fulfilled spiritually now in the church (either on earth or in heaven) or as references to the eternal state. Using the same literal, historical, grammatical principles of interpretation so as to determine the normal sense of language, one is left with the inescapable conclusion that Christ will return and reign in a real kingdom on earth for 1,000 years. There is nothing in the text to render the conclusion that “a thousand years” is symbolic. Never in Scripture when “year” is used with a number is its meaning not literal ( <i>see note on <a ref='2 Peter 3:8'>2Pe 3:8</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 20:3'>20:3</a> <b>the abyss.</b> All 7 times that this appears in Revelation, it refers to the place where fallen angels and evil spirits are kept captive, waiting to be sent to the lake of fire—the final hell prepared for them ( <a ref='Matthew 25:41'>Mt 25:41</a> ). <b>released for a short time.</b> Satan will be released so God can make a permanent end of sin before establishing the new heaven and earth. All who survive the Tribulation and enter the kingdom will be believers. However, despite that and the personal presence and rule of the Lord Jesus Christ, many of their descendants will refuse to believe in Him. Satan will then gather those unbelievers for one final, futile rebellion against God. It will be quickly and decisively crushed, followed by the Great White Throne Judgment and the establishment of the eternal state. <a ref='Revelation 20:4'>20:4</a> <b>the souls of those who had been beheaded.</b> These are tribulation martyrs (cf. <a ref='Revelation 6:9'>6:9</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 18:24'>18:24</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:2'>19:2</a> ). The Greek word translated “beheaded” became a general term for execution, not necessarily a particular method. <b>the mark.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 13:16'>13:16</a> .</i> Tribulation martyrs will be executed for refusing the mark of the beast. <b>reigned.</b> Tribulation believers, along with the redeemed from both the OT and NT eras, will reign with Christ ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:2'>1Co 6:2</a> ; <a ref='2 Timothy 2:12'>2Ti 2:12</a> ) during the 1,000-year kingdom. <a ref='Revelation 20:5'>20:5</a> <b>The rest of the dead.</b> The bodies of unbelievers of all ages will not be resurrected until the Great White Throne Judgment (vv. <a ref='Revelation 20:12–13'>12–13</a> ). <b>first resurrection.</b> Scripture teaches two kinds of resurrections: the “resurrection of life” and the “resurrection of judgment” ( <a ref='John 5:29'>Jn 5:29</a> ; cf. <a ref='Daniel 12:2'>Da 12:2</a> ; <a ref='Acts 24:15'>Ac 24:15</a> ). The first kind of resurrection is described as “the resurrection of the righteous” ( <a ref='Luke 14:14'>Lk 14:14</a> ), the resurrection of “those who are Christ’s at His coming” ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:23'>1Co 15:23</a> ), and the “better resurrection” ( <a ref='Hebrews 11:35'>Heb 11:35</a> ). It includes only the redeemed of the church age ( <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:13–18'>1Th 4:13–18</a> ), the OT ( <a ref='Daniel 12:2'>Da 12:2</a> ), and the Tribulation (v. <a ref='Revelation 20:4'>4</a> ). They will enter the kingdom in resurrection bodies, along with believers who survived the Tribulation.

There are no living sinners left in the destroyed universe since all sinners were killed and all believers glorified. <b>books.</b> These books record every thought, word, and deed of sinful men—all recorded by divine omniscience ( <i>see note on <a ref='Daniel 7:9–10'>Da 7:9–10</a></i> , the verse that is the source of this text). They will provide the evidence for eternal condemnation. Cf. <a ref='Revelation 18:6–7'>18:6–7</a> . book <b>of life.</b> It contains the names of all the redeemed ( <a ref='Daniel 12:1'>Da 12:1</a> ; <i>see notes on <a ref='Revelation 3:5'>3:5</a></i> ). <b>judged … according to their deeds.</b> Their thoughts ( <a ref='Luke 8:17'>Lk 8:17</a> ; <a ref='Romans 2:16'>Ro 2:16</a> ), words ( <a ref='Matthew 12:37'>Mt 12:37</a> ), and actions ( <a ref='Matthew 16:27'>Mt 16:27</a> ) will be compared to God’s perfect, holy standard ( <a ref='Matthew 5:48'>Mt 5:48</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:15–16'>1Pe 1:15–16</a> ) and will be found wanting ( <a ref='Romans 3:23'>Ro 3:23</a> ). This also implies that there are degrees of punishment in hell (cf. <a ref='Matthew 10:14–15'>Mt 10:14–15</a> ; <a ref='Matthew 11:22'>11:22</a> ; <a ref='Mark 12:38–40'>Mk 12:38–40</a> ; <a ref='Luke 12:47–48'>Lk 12:47–48</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 10:29'>Heb 10:29</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 20:13'>20:13</a> <b>death and Hades.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:18'>1:18</a> .</i> Both terms describe the state of death. All unrighteous dead will appear at the Great White Throne Judgment; none will escape. All the places that have held the bodies of the unrighteous dead will yield up new bodies suited for hell. <a ref='Revelation 20:14'>20:14</a> <b>second death.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Revelation 20:6'>6</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 20:15'>20:15</a> <b>lake of fire.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 19:20'>19:20</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 21:1'>21:1</a> As the chapter opens, all the sinners of all the ages, both demons and men, including Satan, the beast, and false prophet, are in the lake of fire forever. The whole universe has been destroyed, and God creates a new universe to be the eternal dwelling place of the redeemed. <b>a new heaven and a new earth.</b> The entire universe as we now know it will be destroyed ( <a ref='2 Peter 3:10–13'>2Pe 3:10–13</a> ) and be replaced by a new creation that will last forever. This is an OT reality ( <a ref='Psalms 102:25–26'>Ps 102:25–26</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 65:17'>Is 65:17</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 66:22'>66:22</a> ), as well as a NT one ( <a ref='Luke 21:33'>Lk 21:33</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 1:10–12'>Heb 1:10–12</a> ). <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 20:11–15'>20:11–15</a> .</i> <b>no longer</b> any <b>sea.</b> Currently three-fourths of the earth’s surface is water, but the new environment will no longer be water-based and will have completely different climatic conditions. <i>See notes on <a ref='Revelation 22:1–2'>22:1–2</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 21:2–22:5'>21:2—22:5</a> By this point in the chronology of Revelation, OT saints, tribulation saints, and all those converted during the millennial kingdom will be incorporated into the ultimate redeemed bride and will dwell in the New Jerusalem. John described the consummation of all things in Christ and the New Jerusalem descending into the eternal state (cf. <a ref='Revelation 19:7'>19:7</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 20:6'>20:6</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:28'>1Co 15:28</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 12:22–24'>Heb 12:22–24</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 21:2'>21:2</a> <b>new Jerusalem.</b> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 3:12'>3:12</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 11:10'>Heb 11:10</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 12:22–24'>12:22–24</a> ; <a ref='Hebrews 13:14'>13:14</a> . This is the capital city of heaven, a place of perfect holiness. It is seen “coming down out of heaven,” indicating it already existed; but it descends into the new heavens and new earth from its place on high. This is the city where the saints will live (cf. <a ref='John 14:1–3'>Jn 14:1–3</a> ). <b>bride.</b> An important NT metaphor for the church (cf. <a ref='Matthew 25:1–13'>Mt 25:1–13</a> ; <a ref='Ephesians 5:25–27'>Eph 5:25–27</a> ). John’s imagery here extends from the third part of the Jewish wedding, the ceremony. Believers (the bride) in the New Jerusalem come to meet Christ (the bridegroom) in the final ceremony of redemptive history ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 19:7'>19:7</a></i> ). The whole city, occupied by all the saints, is called the bride, so that all saints must be finally included in the bride imagery and bridal blessing. God has brought home a bride for His beloved Son. All the saints live with Christ in the Father’s house (a promise made before the church began; <a ref='John 14:2'>Jn 14:2</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 21:3'>21:3</a> <b>the tabernacle of God.</b> The word translated “tabernacle” means place of abode. This is God’s house, the place where He lives (cf. <a ref='Leviticus 26:11–12'>Lv 26:11–12</a> ; <a ref='Deuteronomy 12:5'>Dt 12:5</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 21:4'>21:4</a> wipe away every tear <b>.</b> Since there will never be a tear in heaven, nothing will be sad, disappointing, deficient, or wrong (cf. <a ref='Isaiah 53:4–5'>Is 53:4–5</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 15:54–57'>1Co 15:54–57</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 21:5'>21:5</a> <b>faithful and true.</b> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 3:14'>3:14</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:11'>19:11</a> . God always speaks truth ( <a ref='John 17:17'>Jn 17:17</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 21:6'>21:6</a> <b>the Alpha and the Omega.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:8'>1:8</a> .</i> <b>the one who thirsts.</b> Heaven belongs to those who, knowing their souls are parched by sin, have earnestly sought the satisfaction of salvation and eternal life (cf. <a ref='Psalms 42:1–2'>Ps 42:1–2</a> ; <a ref='Isaiah 55:1–2'>Is 55:1–2</a> ; <a ref='John 7:37–38'>Jn 7:37–38</a> ). <b>water of life.</b> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 7:17'>7:17</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 22:1'>22:1</a> , <a ref='Revelation 22:17'>17</a> . The lasting spiritual water of which Jesus spoke ( <a ref='John 4:13–14'>Jn 4:13–14</a> ; <a ref='John 7:37–38'>7:37–38</a> ; cf. <a ref='Isaiah 55:1–2'>Is 55:1–2</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 21:7'>21:7</a> <b>He who overcomes.</b> Cf. <a ref='1 John 5:4–5'>1Jn 5:4–5</a> . Anyone who exercises saving faith in Jesus Christ ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 2:7'>2:7</a></i> ). <b>inherit.</b> The spiritual inheritance all believers will receive ( <a ref='1 Peter 1:4'>1Pe 1:4</a> ; cf. <a ref='Matthew 25:23'>Mt 25:23</a> ) is the fullness of the new creation. Cf. <a ref='Romans 8:16–17'>Ro 8:16–17</a> . <a ref='Revelation 21:8'>21:8</a> A solemn, serious warning about the kinds of people who will be outcasts from the new heaven and the new earth in the lake of fire. The NT often goes beyond just citing unbelief in listing character and lifestyle traits of the outcast, so that believers can identify such people ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 6:9–10'>1Co 6:9–10</a> ; <a ref='Galatians 5:19'>Ga 5:19</a> ; cf. <a ref='John 8:31'>Jn 8:31</a> ). <b>sorcerers.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 9:21'>9:21</a> .</i> <b>lake that burns with fire.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 19:20'>19:20</a> .</i> <b>brimstone.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 9:17'>9:17</a> .</i> <b>second death.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 20:6'>20:6</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 21:9'>21:9</a> <b>seven bowls.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 15:7'>15:7</a> .</i> <b>seven last plagues.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 15:1–8'>15:1–8</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 21:9–10'>21:9–10</a> <b>the wife of the Lamb.</b> The New Jerusalem takes on the character of its inhabitants, the redeemed ( <i>see notes on v. <a ref='Revelation 21:2'>2</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 19:7–9'>19:7–9</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 21:10'>21:10</a> <b>in the Spirit.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:10'>1:10</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 21:11'>21:11</a> <b>jasper.</b> A transliteration, not a translation, of the Greek word. Rather than the modern opaque jasper, the term actually refers to a completely clear diamond, a perfect gem with the brilliant light of God’s glory shining out of it and streaming over the new heaven and the new earth (cf. <a ref='Revelation 4:3'>4:3</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 21:12–14'>21:12–14</a> <b>wall.</b> See v. <a ref='Revelation 21:16'>16</a> for the dimensions of the city and, thus, the length of the wall. <a ref='Revelation 21:15'>21:15</a> <b>gold measuring rod.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Ezekiel 40:3'>Eze 40:3</a> .</i> This rod was about 10 ft. long, a standard for measure. <b>measure the city.</b> This action indicates that the capital of heaven belongs to God and He is measuring what is His (cf. <a ref='Revelation 11:1'>11:1</a> ; <a ref='Ezekiel 40:3'>Eze 40:3</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 21:16'>21:16</a> <b>12,000 stadia.</b> This would be about two million square miles of ground space, offering plenty of room for all the glorified saints to live. <b>length and width and height.</b> The city has the symmetrical dimensions of a perfect cube, which parallels its closest earthly counterpart, the inner sanctuary in the tabernacle and temple (cf. <a ref='1 Kings 6:20'>1Ki 6:20</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 21:17'>21:17</a> <b>144 cubits.</b> This is likely the width of the wall. <a ref='Revelation 21:18'>21:18</a> <b>jasper.</b> <i>See note on v. <a ref='Revelation 21:11'>11</a> .</i> This is the material of the thick wall—diamond! <b>pure gold, like pure glass.</b> Unlike earth’s gold, this gold will be transparent so the overpowering radiance of God’s glory can refract and glisten through the entire city. <a ref='Revelation 21:19–20'>21:19–20</a> Because some of the names of these gems have changed through the centuries, it is difficult to identify each one with certainty. Eight of the 12 stones are found in the breastpiece of the High Priest ( <a ref='Ex 28-39'>Ex 28–39</a> ), and the other 4 may also be related to the breastpiece. The gems picture a brilliant, indescribable panoply of beautiful colors that send forth the light of God’s glory. The following are possible identifications for these gems. <a ref='Revelation 21:19'>21:19</a> <b>chalcedony.</b> This name derives from Chalcedon, an ancient name for a city in modern Turkey. The gem is a sky-blue agate stone with translucent, colored stripes. <a ref='Revelation 21:20'>21:20</a> <b>sardonyx.</b> A variety of chalcedony with parallel layers of red and white ( <i>see note on v. <a ref='Revelation 21:19'>19</a></i> ). <b>sardius.</b> A common stone from the quartz family, which ranged in color from orange-red to brownish-red to blood-red ( <a ref='Revelation 4:3'>4:3</a> ). <b>chrysolite.</b> A gem with a transparent gold or yellowish tone. <b>beryl.</b> A mineral with several varieties of gems, ranging from the green emerald to the golden yellow beryl to the light blue aquamarine. <b>topaz.</b> Ancient topaz was a softer stone with a yellow or yellow-green color. <b>chrysoprase.</b> The modern form of this jewel is an apple-green variety of quartz. The Greek name suggests a gold-tinted, green gemstone. <b>jacinth.</b> Today this stone is a transparent zircon, usually red or reddish-brown. The one John saw was blue or shining violet in color. <b>amethyst.</b> A clear quartz crystal that ranges in color from a faint purple tint to an intense purple. <a ref='Revelation 21:21'>21:21</a> <b>a single pearl.</b> Each of the gates of the city is a single, almost 1,400-mile-high pearl. Even as earthly pearls are formed in response to the wounding of oyster flesh, so these gigantic, supernatural pearls will remind saints throughout eternity of the magnitude of Christ’s suffering and its eternal benefit. <a ref='Revelation 21:22'>21:22</a> <b>no sanctuary.</b> Several passages affirm that there is a temple in heaven ( <a ref='Revelation 3:12'>3:12</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 7:15'>7:15</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 11:19'>11:19</a> ; <a ref='Revelation 15:5'>15:5</a> ). Here, it is clear there is none in eternity. How can this be? The temple is not a building; it is the Lord God Himself. <a ref='Revelation 7:15'>Revelation 7:15</a> implies this when it says, “He who sits on the throne will dwell over them.” Verse <a ref='Revelation 21:23'>23</a> continues the thought of no temple, except God and the Lamb. The glory of God which illuminates all heaven defines it as His temple. There is no need for a temple in the eternal state since God Himself will be the temple in which everything exists. The presence of God lit. fills the entire new heaven and new earth (cf. v. <a ref='Revelation 21:3'>3</a> ). Going to heaven will be entering the limitless presence of the Lord (cf. <a ref='John 14:3'>Jn 14:3</a> ; <a ref='1 Thessalonians 4:17'>1Th 4:17</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 21:24'>21:24</a> <b>the nations.</b> Lit. “the peoples.” Redeemed people from every nation and ethnic group will dwell in heaven’s light. In the eternal city, there will be no more divisions, barriers, or exclusions because of race or politics. All kinds of peoples in eternity dissolve into the people of God, and they will move freely in and about the city. <a ref='Revelation 21:27'>21:27</a> <b>Lamb’s book of life.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 3:5'>3:5</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 22:1'>22:1</a> <b>river … of life.</b> This river is unlike any on earth because no hydrological cycle exists. Water of life symbolizes the continual flow of eternal life from God’s throne to heaven’s inhabitants ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 21:6'>21:6</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 22:2'>22:2</a> <b>tree of life.</b> A symbol of both eternal life and continual blessing ( <i>see note on <a ref='Genesis 2:9'>Ge 2:9</a></i> ). The tree bears 12 fruits, one for each month, and is symbolic of the abundant variety in heaven. The English word “therapeutic” comes from the Greek word translated “healing.” The leaves somehow enrich heavenly life, making it full and satisfying. <a ref='Revelation 22:3'>22:3</a> <b>no longer be any curse.</b> The curse on humanity and the earth as a result of Adam’s and Eve’s disobedience ( <a ref='Genesis 3:16–19'>Ge 3:16–19</a> ) will be totally finished. God will never have to judge sin again, since it will never exist in the new heaven and new earth. <b>His slaves will serve Him.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 7:15'>7:15</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 22:4'>22:4</a> <b>see His face.</b> No unglorified human could see God’s face and live ( <a ref='Exodus 33:20–23'>Ex 33:20–23</a> ). But the residents of heaven can look on God’s face without harm because they are now holy (cf. <a ref='John 1:18'>Jn 1:18</a> ; <a ref='1 Timothy 6:16'>1Ti 6:16</a> ; <a ref='1 John 3:2'>1Jn 3:2</a> ). <b>His name.</b> They are God’s personal possession ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 3:12'>3:12</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 22:5'>22:5</a> <b>they will reign.</b> Heaven’s citizens are more than servants ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 3:21'>3:21</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 22:6'>22:6</a> <b>His slaves.</b> The members of the 7 churches of Asia Minor who received this letter ( <a ref='Revelation 1:11'>1:11</a> ), and then all believers who have read, or will read it since. <b>things which must soon take place.</b> This involves the entire revelation which John has just related ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 1:1'>1:1</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 22:7'>22:7</a> <b>I am coming quickly.</b> Jesus’ return is imminent ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 3:11'>3:11</a></i> ). <b>Blessed.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:3'>1:3</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 22:8'>22:8</a> <b>hearing and seeing.</b> John resumes speaking for the first time since chap. <a ref='Rev 1'>1</a> and confirms the veracity of the revelation with his own eyewitness testimony—the basis of any reliable witness. <b>fell down to worship.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 19:10'>19:10</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 22:10'>22:10</a> <b>Do not seal up the words.</b> Cf. <a ref='Revelation 10:11'>10:11</a> . Previous prophecies were sealed up ( <a ref='Daniel 8:26'>Da 8:26</a> ; <a ref='Daniel 12:4–10'>12:4–10</a> ). These prophecies are to be proclaimed so they can produce obedience and worship. <b>the time is near.</b> This refers to imminency, which means that the end is next. <a ref='Revelation 22:11'>22:11</a> Those who reject God’s warnings will fix their eternal destiny in hell, where they will retain their evil and filthy natures for all eternity. Those who respond to the warnings will fix their eternal destiny in glory and realize perfect righteousness and holiness in heaven. <a ref='Revelation 22:12'>22:12</a> <b>I am coming quickly.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 3:11'>3:11</a> .</i> Again, imminence is the issue (cf. <a ref='Mark 13:33–37'>Mk 13:33–37</a> ). <b>according to his work.</b> Only those works which survive God’s testing fire have eternal value and are worthy of reward ( <a ref='1 Corinthians 3:10–15'>1Co 3:10–15</a> ; <a ref='1 Corinthians 4:1–5'>4:1–5</a> ; <a ref='2 Corinthians 5:10'>2Co 5:10</a> ). <a ref='Revelation 22:13'>22:13</a> <b>the Alpha and the Omega.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:8'>1:8</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 22:14'>22:14</a> <b>Blessed are those who wash their robes.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 1:3'>1:3</a> .</i> This symbolizes those who have been forgiven of their sins—who have been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb of God ( <a ref='Hebrews 9:14'>Heb 9:14</a> ; <a ref='1 Peter 1:18–19'>1Pe 1:18–19</a> ; <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 7:14'>7:14</a></i> ). <b>tree of life.</b> <i>See notes on v. <a ref='Revelation 22:2'>2</a> ; <a ref='Genesis 2:9'>Ge 2:9</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 22:15'>22:15</a> <b>dogs.</b> Considered despicable creatures in NT times, the term when applied to people referred to anyone of low moral character. Unfaithful leaders ( <a ref='Isaiah 56:10'>Is 56:10</a> ) and homosexual prostitutes ( <a ref='Deuteronomy 23:18'>Dt 23:18</a> ) are among those who received such a designation. <b>sorcerers.</b> <i>See note on <a ref='Revelation 9:21'>9:21</a> .</i> <a ref='Revelation 22:16'>22:16</a> <b>My angel.</b> See <a ref='Revelation 1:1'>1:1</a> . <b>the churches.</b> The 7 churches of Asia Minor who were the book’s original recipients ( <a ref='Revelation 1:11'>1:11</a> ). <b>the root and the descendant of David.</b> Christ is the source (“root”) of David’s life and line of descendants, which establishes His deity. He is also a “descendant” of David, which establishes His humanity. This phrase gives powerful testimony to Christ as the God-Man (cf. <a ref='2 Timothy 2:8'>2Ti 2:8</a> ). <b>bright morning star.</b> This is the brightest star announcing the arrival of the day. When Jesus comes, He will be the brightest star who will shatter the darkness of man’s night and herald the dawn of God’s glorious day ( <i>see note on <a ref='Revelation 2:28'>2:28</a></i> ). <a ref='Revelation 22:17'>22:17</a> <b>Come.</b> This is the Spirit’s and church’s answer to the promise of His coming. <b>let the one.</b> This is an unlimited offer of grace and salvation to all who desire to have their thirsty souls quenched.

These warnings against altering the biblical text represent the close of the NT canon.
